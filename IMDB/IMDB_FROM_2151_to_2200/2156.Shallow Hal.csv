0,MartinHafer,Force yourself to watch the film through until the end,8,19 November 2006,"When this film came to the theaters, I had zero interest in seeing it, since most of the clips I saw were just cheap 'fat jokes'--such as the scene where Ms. Paltrow jumps into the pool and practically empties it. The film looked pretty cruel and besides that I am NOT a fan of the Farrelly brothers--I hated DUMB AND DUMBER as well as KINGPIN, as the jokes seemed all too often geared towards the more ignorant teens in the world. So, when it comes to expectations for the film, it would be very difficult to find someone who was more negatively inclined towards liking the movie. In fact, the only reason I saw the film is that my uncle came for a visit and he wanted to see the film. Not wanting to be a kill-joy, I saw it and said nothing. Surprisingly, after all the initial fat jokes, the film had a lot of depth and good-natured humor and I would heartily recommend it! So why did I like it? Well, despite the crude style of the jokes, the humor was secondary and supported the deeper message. While I don't NEED a message to my humor (after all, I'm a guy that loves MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL), it often helps elevate films to greater depth and meaning. In this case, Hal is a total jerk who only looks at the superficial in women. In a bizarre turn, Tony Robbins apparently has magical powers and changes Hal so he ONLY sees beneath the surface. Now, the inner beauty or ugliness is how he perceives everyone. Now of course, it's a foregone conclusion that he will fall in love with ultra-fat Paltrow, but it's the rest of the people around him that make this an inspired film. A great example was the beautiful woman who is using Hal's disabled rich friend. Everyone saw her as very pretty, but since she was such a shallow and evil person, Hal's impression of her was priceless. However, by far the best example was the touching scene where his original way of seeing people is returned and he realizes that the beautiful children he befriended are in fact burn victims--it is a very heavy scene emotionally and didn't really seem gratuitous or cheap.Another plus for the film was Jason Alexander. I never was a huge fan of good old George Kostanza, but in this film he is great as a sidekick for Hal. His even greater shallowness and insensitivity is great because the character has so much going wrong with him physically that he should be the last person to make these judgments! I don't want to say much more, as it would spoil your impressions, but he was perfect in this role. And, like Hal, you see some profound changes take place during the course of the film.All in all, the film is a wonderful film. Those who hate ME, MYSELF AND IRENE, DUMB AND DUMBER, THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, etc. don't give up on this film. The crudeness of these other films is not apparent in SHALLOW HAL and this is actually a film you can let your kids see and still be a responsible parent!!!",Shallow Hal
1,SnoopyStyle,shallow movie making fun of shallowness,4,28 March 2015,"At the age of 9, Hal Larson gets superficial advise from his delirious dying preacher father. He tells him to judge woman by their looks and forget about love. Hal (Jack Black) turns into a shallow man almost as bad as his friend Mauricio Wilson (Jason Alexander). His neighbor Jill (Susan Ward) dumps him. He gets stuck in an elevator with motivational guru Tony Robbins who hypnotizes him into seeing inner beauty as outer beauty. He starts dating overweight Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow) but he can only see her inner beauty.For a movie making fun of shallow behavior, it's actually pretty shallow itself. All the beautiful people are ugly inside. It's difficult to see Hal or Wilson ever getting a date. All the fat jokes essentially clash with the theme of judging people by their inner self. Even if a joke hits, I wonder about who the joke is making fun of. I am willing to give the Farrelly brothers credit for trying to tackle something substantial. There is a touching rom-com buried beneath everything. They do it in such a loopy way that I don't think it actually works. Although the little girl really hits me in the heart.",Shallow Hal
2,kosmasp,Flawed but funny,7,14 February 2021,"First things first: remember that this movie has quite the big holes internally. The logic it sets out, the world it builds ... a house of cards seems like a concrete and solid strucure if you'd compare them. That is especially true when you think about the perception thing. A very funny (if you are not easily offended) sight gag ... that is not completely thought through or made just for those it feels the jokes are working for.Again don't overthink it, don't be too PC about the premise either. I doubt the movie could be made nowadays. When Avengers had ""fat Thor"" the outcry was massive ... what would they say about this then? One can only imagine. And before you say well this is a comedy, Thor is a God (well supposedly, even if not at least not a human)! So if people were mad about that ... and I'm not trying to tell anyone how they should feel about certain things. Perception again is key ... it would be just a waste of your time if you were to be easily offended. I found myself cringing at moments and I do give movies like this some slack to say the least.It was also important that Hal would not be the shallowest person in the movie ... though with his friend you also don't see him changing ... than again maybe his exterior matches his interior? Or maybe not ... again why am I even thinking about this? I shouldn't ... enjoy this if you can",Shallow Hal
3,lee_eisenberg,go deep,7,28 August 2006,"We can always expect the Farrelly brothers to be far out, and they don't disappoint with ""Shallow Hal"" (although this one isn't a gross-out fest in the vein of ""Dumb and Dumber""). Jack Black plays loner Hal Larson, who gets hypnotized by Tony Robbins so that he only sees inner beauty. Therefore, when he meets 300-pound Rosemary Shanahan (Gwyneth Paltrow), she appears to him less than half her weight. Other people don't look like their normal selves either, so we may figure that Hal is in for a rude awakening sooner or later.OK, so it's a completely outlandish idea, but the Farrelly brothers know what to do here. Some scenes are really likely to blow your mind, but the movie also does take a good look at superficiality in relationships. Also starring Jason Alexander, Joe Viterelli and Bruce McGill (that's right, D-Day!).",Shallow Hal
4,jboothmillard,Shallow Hal,5,20 September 2005,"From the Farrelly brothers (Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary) comes another pretty good comedy romance about the real meaning of beauty, inside and out, and the meaning of what it's like to fall for one of them. Basically Hal Larson (Jack Black) is a guy who has a very shallow view of women, he always tries for the young attractive ones. Then one day he meets a doctor who gives him a special gift, to see the inner beauty of women. So guess what, he sees many beautiful women in his eyes, but to us they look like old women or just ugly. Then one day, he meets the girl of his dreams, the big outside but beautiful inside Rosemary Shanahan (Gwyneth Paltrow). His best mate knows what he is in love with, but Hal doesn't. He lasts ages with his inner beauty queen, he even has sex with her. Eventually when he is back to normal, he still cares about his love, even if she is fat. A pretty nice story explaining that beauty isn't everything. Worth watching!",Shallow Hal
5,ccthemovieman-1,Pretty Funny Film With A Good Message,8,25 October 2006,"Do you judge a person - particularly a woman - by her outward appearance? If you do, you're ""shallow"" and that's the message played out in this comedy. The humor in here is good, very funny in spots. There are plenty of jokes and sight gags. If you are obese and very sensitive, then skip this film because you won't appreciate some of the humor in this film. But, if you can laugh at yourself, you'll enjoy it too - and especially the message this film brings.Jack Black was pretty much of an unknown actor when this came out, but he's well-known now after School Of Rock, King Kong and other films. Gwyneth Paltrow everyone knows. She looked very pretty in here, maybe the best I've ever seen her. Jason Alexander and Joe Viterelli provide good supporting help. By the way, it was strange hearing Viterelli with an Irish accent. This is a guy who almost always plays Mafia types.The only thing offensive to me was the beginning with some irreverent humor that was not needed, not part of the story, just a cheap shot against ministers. Also, for a lightweight comedy, the profanity could have been less. Can't someone make a modern-day comedy without language and sex issues? I wish someone would at least try. It can be done - just look at the classics!Anyway, this is still a pretty funny story with, of course, a good message about judging a book by its cover.",Shallow Hal
6,moonspinner55,"Slick and shallow, full of rude jokes followed by apologies...",4,14 December 2008,"""Shallow Hal"", co-written by its directors, Bobby and Peter Farrelly, with Sean Moynihan, represents a new type of impudent comedy: rude jokes and raucous gags followed by apologies--to gain the support of the team's followers while side-stepping criticism by proponents of modern 'correctness'. Jack Black plays a womanizing jerk named Hal whose perceptions about the opposite sex are completely turned around after a self-help doctor hypnotizes him in an elevator, causing him to see the inner beauty in women despite their outer appearances. Soon, Hal falls hard for a 300-lb girl whom he perceives to be a shapely sexpot (turns out she's a really nice person, too--what would've happened if she were a creep just like him?). The Farrelly Brothers pour on the PC-charm in this slick comedy, though one can tell where their hearts truly lie (the episodes wherein Gwyneth Paltrow--in a fat suit--jumps into a public pool or decimates a chair are squeezed for maximum impact). By trying to have things both ways, the Farrelly's appear to pandering to broad commercial appeal; but, since their movie doesn't acknowledge that its own outcome is a cop-out, the whole thing feels like a (very shallow) mistake. *1/2 from ****",Shallow Hal
7,Quinoa1984,The least in the Farrelly Brothers' movies to date,4,11 November 2001,"Shallow Hal, the latest installment from the Farrelly Brothers, is possibly the least funny of their films.  And not all of it lies on that a good amount of the jokes were duds, but also in the audience.  When I saw the movie,l it was packed and in the front area were a whole mess load of kids that kept on jabbering with friends and cell phones and such.  It is always hard to hear potentially funny lines when teenie boppers crowd the speaker area.  Anyway, the movie has it's flaws itself though.  It's not a terrbile movie, or even a real bad one either, but just, misfired.  Jack Black, usually hilarious, plays Hal who sees women soley on their looks (hey, don't all men basically do that), and then gets stuck in an elevator with Tony Robbins who hypnotizes himm to see a woman's inner beauty long long before physical beauty.  This stays with him as he meets a sweet yet quite obese Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow), and falls in love.  To me, the concept the Farrelly's present sounds like a good idea, but I have my problems with it and that come forth in the movie.  Why would all the ugly and fat girls that Hal meets in the movie always seem hot to him? Why is the line drawn so thinly that all ugly and fat girls have inner beauty and all the good looking ones have no inner beauty?  An interesting premise comes forth here and works and doesn't work because 1) it's hard to figure out in the midst of the ususal Farrelly gags and 2) a topic that is quite debatable is not needed from directors who are famous for bringing forth scenes of such disgust and obcenity they make Marilyn Manson cringe. Unless the directors want to change directions which could be a mistake also.There are laughs though, I'm not going to put down a film really low where Jason Alexander plays a guy who can be summed up in 2 words- hair-spray. And there is some good hilarity sprinkled here and there.  I wish there could've been more though.  B-",Shallow Hal
8,Coventry,The Farrelly brothers lost that one thing that made them unique...,6,2 February 2004,"I'm not saying this film is a complete failure but it's terribly average and uninteresting. The Farrelly brothers made their name in the field by writing and directing brainless comedy without any form of moral or message...and that's what made them so unique in the 90's, which overall was a decade with very few good comedies! Dumb and Dumberer, Kingpin, There's something about Mary...all these are examples of enjoyable flicks and you don't have to worry about picking up any important life-lessons. Shallow Hal tries to achieve the exact opposite. Instead of attacking the audience with a neverending series of hilarious situations and jokes, the brothers shove the fact that inner-beauty is so much more important down your throat. A morality lesson that is hard to take...especially coming from these guys. Jack Black is one of the greatest comedian of his generation but he more or less looks lost in this production. There are a couple of funny sequences in Shallow Hal, but there never is ONE moment your stomach hurts from laughing and besides, all the good jokes are in the trailer like usual. So, I recommend watching the trailer and you get the big picture. It's better to re-watch Kingpin (my favorite Farrelly picture) or There's something about Mary and spend money on Shallow Hal.",Shallow Hal
9,michaelRokeefe,Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder.,3,25 January 2003,"Bobby and Peter Farrelly are at it again. Funny, but still a bit awkward. Jack Black is a superficial skirt chaser who is only interested in the ""babes"". A self-help guru hypnotizes him to see the inner beauty and he falls in love with a 300 plus pound woman(Gwyneth Paltrow). I could see where the story's whole concept would be offensive to some; but to me the intended humor just fell short. Also in the cast are:Jason Alexander, Joe Vitrelli and Susan Ward. Miss Ward in my opinion is the real ""hottie"" in this movie. Decent soundtrack featuring Sheryl Crow and Ivy. Wade into the shallow end and don't expect much.",Shallow Hal
10,hitchcockthelegend,Shallow Hal wants a gal.,7,6 November 2014,"Hal Larsen (Jack Black) only ever dates beautiful trophy women on account of advice he received on his death bed from his father. However, a chance meeting with a self-help guru helps him to see inner beauty first and foremost. Soon after, he falls in love with his boss' severely overweight daughter, which as it raises eyebrows everywhere the couple go, Hal is oblivious as to what everyone else is on about.Tender, sweet and subtle are not words one readily attributes to the Farrelly Brothers, but in Shallow Hal they have managed to blend all three with their penchant for close to the knuckle humour.Gwyneth Paltrow in the dual role dons the fat-suit and once again showcases her unheralded comic timing, while Jack Black proves ebullient and engaging in a role that calls for him to shut out what he is actually meant to be seeing. In support Jason Alexander gets the weasel best friend comedy sidekick role, and is wonderfully abhorrent and good at keeping the cards close to his chest.It's never uproariously funny, but it doesn't need to be, it tickles where it needs to, and it prods the emotional psyche with requisite impact. In a world that has become obsessed with the girth and weight of a person, especially with women - and as it happens is led by Hollywood, Shallow Hal is refreshing entertainment. 7/10",Shallow Hal
11,Theo Robertson,I Was Expecting something Else,6,13 September 2003,"Did the Farrelly brothers really make this ? They were the guys who made DUMB AND DUMBER , KINGPIN , ME MYSELF AND IRENE and who made the fantastic THERE`S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY , so I was expecting another movie involving cruelty to animals and other offensive topics , but I was rather disappointed . Don`t get me wrong this is a very watchable romantic comedy and is more amusing than most comedies coming out of Hollywood but at the end of the day it`s just another rom com albeit one with a very interesting premise . It`s just that the manic cruelty of the Farrelly brothers is totally missing . I suppose they could defend themselves by saying SHALLOW HAL is their most disciplined , intelligent movie and they`d be right . It`s far from being their best movie however",Shallow Hal
12,jotix100,"Is Beauty skin deep, or is it on the eye of the beholder?",4,3 December 2001,"The latest comedy by the Farrelly brothers seems to hold those 2 principles as the theme of this misguided comedy. Jack Black seems to be playing against type in this movie, since he, himself, is plump and not the matinee idol actor you would expect to be the leading man of this film, let alone be the interest of Gwyneth Paltrow. When he sees Rose Mary through his trance-like state, he doesn't seem to notice his own imperfections. He wants to be accepted by the same people that upon looking at him, feel repulsion. He indeed is a shallow person and a creep to top that. But he doesn't spend a second to examine his own ugliness and his own shortcomings in the persuit of the beautiful and elusive women that don't even give him the time of the day until Rose Mary comes into the picture. When Mauricio, who's played by Jason Alexander, appears at the beginning of the film, he looks like he's a monkey, or that he's wearing an enormous yamulke on top of his head. He looks hideous and he makes a perfect companion to Shallow Hal Larson. Jason Alexander seems to be still playing George Constanza in the Seinfeld series and frankly, he's so one-dimensional that his character seems to be the real shallow one. Perhaps another actor would have been able to make this part more enjoyable, the same way that the role of Hal would have been better cast with another leading man. Actually, if you see the trailer, you see all the best moments of the film. I want my money back. Shame on the Farrelly brothers to give us this piece of pure, unadulterated garbage.",Shallow Hal
13,preppy-3,Interesting,7,9 November 2001,"A totally self-absorbed man Hal (Jack Black) who just judges women by their bodies, is put under a sort of spell by Anthony Robbins so he sees what they're like inside.  He falls in love with Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow) who he sees as--well, looking like Gwneth Paltrow!  Actually she's very VERY fat.  His pal Jason Alexander can't figure out what's going on and tries to stop him.Who would have thought the Farrelly Brothers could make an interesting, low key comedy?  The jokes are sparse and obvious but I liked the movie even when it wasn't funny.  It's well-written, well-acted (especially by Black and Paltrow--who I usually hate) and makes the far-fetched plot believable (sort of).  It makes the obvious points of loving someone for who they are inside not outside but doesn't overdo it.  The only real bad thing about the movie is Jason Alexander.  He's loud, obnoxious and totally unfunny--I started to dread it when he appeared on screen.  Other than that, this is a quiet comedy--don't go if you want a laugh out loud movie.Also, stay seated for the closing credits.",Shallow Hal
14,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Gets some right, but does still come up short",6,10 November 2009,"The Farrelly's aren't exactly known for depth... rather, their R-rated, crude comedies that cross the line. Here, they try to go for both. The ensuing balancing act lead them to walk on egg-shells(to an extent), and both laughs and drama suffer. I'm not sure the material was solid to begin with... you know the type of jokes and gags from the trailer; Jack thinks she's skinny, nobody else does... oh, and here's the kicker; she's... *snicker, giggle*... overweight! Isn't that hilarious?! It's blown out of proportion, of course. Only, at the same time, it's restrained. ...yeah. It's confusing. This does manage to be sweet. It also succeeds in getting us to like the ones we're meant to, and vice versa. Sadly, it remains superficial, possibly because of the brothers' being so used to working with visuals. The contradiction in the concept is quite obvious. I hope that the following is not surprising or a mystery: Our perception of beauty is based upon two things, how healthy(and thus, a fine choice for a mate, on the biological, instinctive level), and the local idea of what is attractive, influenced by culture and, where applicable, the media. Here in the West, extremely thin girls are often promoted as ""hot"", and they did not take the latter into account when making this. This flick does get some laughs. Black and Robbins are excellent together. Paltrow delivers a spot-on performance. The reveal is effective. Music is great and fits. The DVD comes with an informative audio commentary by the directors, a bunch of deleted scenes, a handful of well-done featurettes, a music video and a trailer. I recommend this to big fans of the stars, and maybe of those who put it together, as well. 6/10",Shallow Hal
15,view_and_review,Feel good comedy,7,27 June 2007,"I never saw ""School of Rock"", but I'd have to say that this is the best Jack Black performance I've seen. The movie was an interesting and humorous approach to not ""judging a book by its cover"", or ""beauty is only skin deep"", or ""it's what's on the inside that counts"", and so many other idioms that express the same principal. The movie was well done and was probably more heart warming than it was funny. I think the premise for the entire movie could be summed up in one scene. It was just after Mauricio broke the spell on Hal: Hal: Okay, who do you think is the most beautiful woman in the world? Mauricio: Wonder Woman.Hal: Okay... let's say everyone else in the world thought Wonder Woman was ugly.Mauricio: It wouldn't matter. Because I know they'd be wrong.Hal: See! That's what I had with Rosemary! I saw a knock out, I don't care what anybody else saw! Mauricio: You're right. I guess I really did screw you, huh?",Shallow Hal
16,AlsExGal,Much better than it's reputation...,7,12 September 2015,"even if it is a new take on an old idea - character sees someone's inner beauty and is shocked when the magical curtain is torn away.Hal (Jack Black) is someone whose last words from his dying father were dad - under the influence of extreme pain killing drugs - telling him to go after pretty girls and forget about love. The message is almost pornographic. This confuses young Hal, who is all of age ten, since dad had always been an upright citizen and a preacher too. Hal blocks this shocking scene out of his conscious mind, but the message becomes the ruler of his subconscious. As a result, as an adult, he is constantly going to bars with his equally shallow pal (Jason Alexander as Mauricio) and trying to chat up and dance with girls way out of his league, and he's not even subtle about it.Fate changes when Hal gets stuck in an elevator with Tony Robbins who puts him under a spell that will make him see only the inner beauty in people, not the external packaging. He winds up catching a glimpse of Rosemary Shanahan, who has a beautiful soul, but is also 300 pounds. At first she thinks he is just making fun of her, but when she finds out his interest is real they start seeing each other. The catch here? Her dad is Hal's boss, and he's been getting nowhere lately getting a promotion at work. One day when Hal and Rosemary come over to her house Hal ends up talking one on one with the boss, and ends up getting the promotion he's been wanting. Of course his coworkers see his progress, see him cozying up to Rosemary and think that he is lower than lice - using the girl to advance his career. As for Mauricio, he goes in search of Tony Robbins to try and undo whatever spell has been cast on his friend, because it is disrupting his social life and Hal's new aesthetics makes no sense to him.When Hal is put back to ""normal"", everybody now looks how they did before. Their physical being is what he sees. This means that he is doing everything he can to not actually see Rosemary since he is in love with her and doesn't want to lose that feeling. From Rosemary's end it looks like Hal got his promotion and is done with her. This is the same opinion that his new boss - who for some reason doesn't fire him - and his coworkers have. How will all of this work out? Watch and find out.There is plenty of low brow humor here, but it is seasoned with a bit of empathy...EXCEPT that the film still indicates that being overweight is just about the worst thing that could happen to someone AND that the reason for that is always out of control gluttony. In other words if you are not a size five it is your own fault. I've never been a fan of Jack Black but I think he did a good job here. As for Jason Alexander, as Mauricio he is still playing George Costanza from Seinfeld, but that is fine with me.",Shallow Hal

It opens with nine year old Hal at his father's death bed being given rather blunt advice about women. Jump ahead and Jack Black as Hal hits the clubs with Jason Alexander and still has no luck with women. When he is met with a famous hypnotist he ends up only seeing a woman's inner beauty. This causes him to fall in love with a 300 pound woman who appears as the thin beautiful Gwyneth Paltrow. It turns out that she is the daughter of his boss and she works with handicapped children. Brilliant work by Peter and Bobby Farrelly with clever surprises involving physical identities. Black is fantastic bewildering his friends on the relationship that only he can see and understand. Paltrow amazingly convinces us of her insecurity. Jason Alexander is superb as Black's best friend with his own secret. Joe Viterelli steals scenes as Paltrow's father. Sometimes vulgar in that some of the dialogue regarding specific women but hits hard truths about our perceptions of people. Tony Robbins makes a great impression playing himself as the hypnotist whose aim is to improve Hal's insights. It is a hilarious film that is far from shallow. Score: 9 / 10",Shallow Hal
18,HotToastyRag,Hilarious and touching,9,6 October 2020,"The Farrelly Brothers strike pure gold with Shallow Hal, a dark comedy about finding a person's inner beauty. There's a laugh every minute, and it very cleverly allows the wonderful message to sink in through the humor. Jack Black is the titular character, and he and his best friend Jason Alexander enjoy picking women apart based on their appearance. Jack has a chance meeting with Tony Robbins in an elevator, and Tony decides to help free him from his judgmental vision. From then on, Jack no longer sees women's exterior. If a woman has a good soul, he sees her as beautiful.During its release, there was some minor pushback from people who didn't understand the meaning. I can only imagine the protesting and criticism if it were released today. This is not a movie that makes fun of overweight or ugly people. It proves a point about inner beauty. It takes the example of one man who has specific standards of physical perfection. If he were a man who only liked blondes, Tony Robbins would have cast a spell that transformed every woman into a blonde so he could see beyond that. When Jack Black is attracted to a woman's inner beauty, she becomes beautiful in the standards he values - not the standards the Farrelly Brothers value.This is an extremely touching, well-acted, thoughtfully directed movie. There are many actors and actresses who play ""dual parts"", their character as others see them, and also as Jack Black sees them. Much like The Enchanted Cottage, the direction shifts within the same scene to show you different perspectives.Gwyneth Paltrow plays Jack's main love interest, an obese woman with a heart of gold. She's funny, quick, and ""humanidocious"". She volunteers at the children's hospital, and also works for the Peace Corps. But because she's obese, Jack would never have looked at her twice he didn't have Tony's spell on him. Now, he's able to appreciate and learn. Even though this movie is extremely funny and every line out of Jason Alexander's mouth is hilarious, the two leads put a lot of drama into their deliveries. Like a lot of movies, the first time you watch it you'll be distracted by your laughter; and the more times you watch it the more you'll be able to appreciate the drama.",Shallow Hal

I think this one will be a classic in time to come because all the scenes are well written. Gwyneth Paltrow as Rosemary manages to convey emotion through the fat suit and that is not mean feat. Jack Black as Hal is just right for the role that deservedly made him a star.

Black and Paltrow were great and Jason Alexander was hilarious.  The movie is about a guy named Hal who is a rather decent guy, but he has a problem.  When picking women he only looks at the outer beauty of a woman...this is explained in the opening scene.  Hal gets trapped in an elevator with a guy who opens Hal's mind to the inner beauty of women.  Hal then suddenly finds the more unattractive girls perfect for him and this leads to some funny scenes.  This also leads him to Rose Mary a gal he finds perfect, but everyone else sees a 300lb gal.  This movie says a lot about how shallow our society is and does a good job of it.  Though I don't think every unattractive or fat gal is beautiful on the inside and every attractive gal is ugly on the inside as the movie implies.  The movie also could have been more clear that people Hal already knows would still look the same.  I just wish ladies were as open and approachable as the movie portrays.",Shallow Hal

Whiney libs that are unable to grasp fantasy and humor might be offended by the fat jokes, but the overall moral is commendable.The flick scores pretty well in the feminine department with Paltrow in her prime and never looking better, speaking as someone who was never overly wowed by her. She's jaw-dropping here and the movie doesn't fail to spotlight her beauty. Other beautiful women are featured, like Susan Ward as Hal's neighbor, Jill.The film runs 1 hour, 54 minutes and was shot in Charlotte, North Carolina.GRADE: B+",Shallow Hal
23,The_Void,Decent enough comedy from the Farrelly brothers,7,7 February 2005,"For a film that only really has one joke - Shallow Hal isn't bad. However, it's not the laugh a minute comedy that was the likes of Dumb and Dumber and There's Something About Mary and the reason for that is that the Farrelly brothers have seen fit to make it the message that's more important this time round, and that's not really what you want when you're watching a Farrelly brothers comedy. However, the jokes, while bordering on cruel, never delve into the realms of Mickey taking and the Farrelly brothers clearly know how to be funny without being harmful. Shallow Hal does feature many 'funny' moments, but most of them are just funny, and not absolutely hilarious like 99 percent of Dumb and Dumber was. The plot follows Hal (Jack Black), a man that judges women on how they look and not what type of person they are. After a meeting with a self-help guru in a lift, Hal is hypnotised into only seeing inner beauty...One of the film's major negative elements is that it suffers from the same affliction of it's central character - namely, it's shallow. The idea that all ugly women have great personalities and all good-looking girls don't is ludicrous and not really the sort of thing that a film professing inner beauty should profess. I admit that sometimes, maybe even fairly often, this can be true - but it's certainly not always, and Shallow Hal has a rather contained outlook because of that fact. The film benefits immensely from the presence of Jack Black, however. Black has proved himself a worthy talent on many occasions, and he does so again here. His comedy timing and delivery are impeccable and he constantly makes you believe in him, and feel for him, as he has such a likable persona. The Farrelly's aren't the greatest directing talent in the business, but kudos to them for giving Black the lead role here.Shallow Hal certainly isn't a great film, but it's good for a laugh and fans of this sort of comedy will like it. There is also a number of touching moments, not as many as I'm sure the Farrelly's envisioned, but at least some made it  and that's nice.",Shallow Hal
24,zetes,I think I should watch it once more,7,5 January 2003,"A frustrating film in a way. I was hugely disappointed in it for a long while, but as the film progressed I kept wondering if my disappointment was merely a product of my unfair expectations. That's probably the case. I expect a daring comedy from the Brothers Farrelly, but Shallow Hal is surprisingly low-key. It doesn't go for easy laughs, as it easily could have done. The plot concerns a looks-obsessed guy (Jack Black) who is hypnotized into seeing the inner beauty of others. He falls in love with a fat woman who appears to him as Gwyneth Paltrow. When the film came out, a lot of people complained that this was terrible; he only loves her because he is attracted to Gwyneth Paltrow, not the fat incarnation that appears in only a couple of shots in the first 90 minutes of the film. But these people didn't really stick around for the payoff in the third act. What's so surprising about this film is how emotionally involving it is. A lot of this is due to Gwyneth Paltrow, who actually gives one of her best performances. But fans of the Farrelly Brothers, as I am myself, will not be shocked to find that emotional center. It was there in both Kingpin and There's Something About Mary. It's just as fun when the Brothers are mean-spirited, however, as they were in Me, Myself, & Irene and, even better, the unfairly maligned Dumb and Dumber. The serious themes are really on full display here, though. The Brothers have a true and touching affection for physical outsiders. I still wish that they wouldn't have forsaken comedy so much, though. I suppose the only jokes would have been fat jokes, but maybe not. Jason Alexander provides almost all of the good laughs. We wonder why he and Jack Black are so mean about the looks of others when they aren't especially gorgeous themselves. Some people are still asking how such a man as Jason Alexander can be so shallow in this film, but they, as I've said before, didn't stick around until the end. This film may improve on repeat viewings, as it was bothering me for a long while. 7/10.",Shallow Hal
25,Sylviastel,A Wonderful Heartfelt Movie to be watched over and over again!,10,27 October 2004,"I read somewhere that Gwyneth Paltrow wore her fat-suit around to see people's reaction. Almost unrecognizable, she received negative, malevolent treatment from total strangers. People were not giving her the time of the day. Obesity is seen as a weakness or an embarrassment by the general population. Even though, the American population is getting more obese each day and not just by eating the wrong foods. One of the reasons I love this movie is that Gwyneth Paltrow's performance as Rosemary gives her a heart and soul. You cannot help but like Rosemary. When Hal sees her under Tony Robbins spell, you begin to see a pattern. He sees other people in the same light. Their inner beauty comes alive. The most heart-wrenching scene is at the pediatric burn unit where he is comforting Cadence. It is perhaps my favorite scene in the movie. Hal becomes more human and falls in love with Rosemary even though he does not see the actual person until the end of the film. I cannot help but like this film for not trying to change Rosemary nor anybody else. It was Hal who needed to be changed. Love is blind until you see the inner beauty of your soulmate. This film is also good to watch to gain a better tolerance and understanding of obesity. You do not have to be physically beautiful to have inner beauty. Inner beauty remains long after the physical beauty has faded away.",Shallow Hal

The wiskey I drank give me the feeling, that all of us laugh with our dark natures at our own or someone else expences. Be it physical humor, racial humor, persons with bad luck, or event at with a violent acton like a kick to the groin we laugh at someone else expecese. We all do this, I do not know if this is a coping mechinism but this movie does this.  It's saving grace is it show how we are brianwashed in self absorbtion of what is beauty and belief in what acounts for a winner. It's not what we drive, or how much money we make, or beer comerical looks that make the person.  Character gotta count for the person also.

Jason Alexander (Mauricio Wilson), ""Odessa or Bust"",'01, was outstanding in his supporting role and had a short TAIL to tell at one point in the picture. There was a great moral truth to this picture, that a person should look deeper into a person and not always feel that their Soul Mate in life has to be slim and trim or look like a fashion model. This picture made you realize that Beauty is only SKIN DEEP and the warmth and love that can come from a person's inner soul is more Important.

29,namashi_1,Beauty Lies In The Eyes Of The Beholder!,9,19 July 2018,"Directed by the Farrelly Brothers, 'Shallow Hal' is a film that depicts the inner beauty in us, with honesty & earnestness. Though its a bit too sweet, its simplicity & its thought of looking beyond the looks, is one to take home. Cleary, this Romantic-Comedy has aged well.'Shallow Hal' Synopsis: A shallow man falls in love with a 300 pound woman because of her ""inner beauty"".The Farrelly Bros have made a film about imperfect people in an imperfect world. And its interesting to see Hal, the protagonist, give life a newer look by getting his shallowness removed. While the Farrelly Brothers have made sure the laughs keep coming in, the subtle message of searching the real beauty in one's soul, is actually heartwarming. I was arrested in Hal's journey & the world would certainly do a lot better if we followed what Hal does here.The Farrelly Bros & Sean Moynihan's Screenplay is sweet & arresting. The Farrelly' Bros' Direction is perfect. Cinematography, Editing & Make-Up, merit a special mention.Performance-Wise: Jack Black is very good as Hal. He gets a meaty role & Black nails the role with a lot of honesty. Gwyneth Paltrow is controlled. Jason Alexander is entirely irritating & convincing as Hal's ever shallow friend. The Late/Great Joe Viterelli is cute. Others lend fair support.On the whole, 'Shallow Hal' is a winner that comes right from the heart.",Shallow Hal
30,Smells_Like_Cheese,I actually liked it,7,22 November 2003,"The Farrely Brothers, these are very odd film makers, they have such hits like There's Something About Mary, Dumb and Dumber and Me, Myself and Irene. I wasn't too thrilled with There's Something About Mary after all the hyped reviews, I was thinking that their other movies would be like that. Especially with the touchy subject of obesity in our world that usually big people are not attractive, making it into a comedy is tricky. But somehow I really loved Shallow Hal. Even though it was a bit hypocritical, it's still really funny and I think it's mainly due to the cast. Jack Black made for a great male lead going from a total jerk into someone that the audience absolutely adored in the end.Hal, a superficial man, and his equally shallow friend Mauricio, share an interest in beautiful women, and try to act cool and hip when around them, but most women find them obnoxious and want nothing to do with them. Hal wants to see women for their inner beauty, but his fixation on physical beauty gets in the way. By a twist of fate, Hal meets the famous American life coach Tony Robbins while stuck in an elevator. Robbins, understanding Hal's situation, hypnotizes him into seeing people's inner beauty, not their external selves. Subsequently Hal meets and is smitten by Rosemary, the daughter of his boss. Rosemary appears to him as slender and beautiful due to her kind, generous nature, but is, in actuality, morbidly obese. Rosemary, who is used to being overlooked by men due to her appearance, initially interprets Hal's interest in her as mocking and insulting, but later realizes his feelings for her are genuine. Mauricio becomes worried about Hal's new taste in women, especially when he finds Hal is in a relationship with Rosemary. One night, while Hal is on a date with Rosemary, Mauricio catches him and says the trigger phrase, ""Shallow Hal wants a gal,"" which breaks Hal's hypnosis. Now Hal has to learn on his own that the woman that he loves may not have been all that in the looks department, but is everything that he actually wants in a woman.My main problem with Shallow Hal is it's shallow message, unfortunately Hal, if he wasn't hypnotized, would have never gone for a girl like Rosemary. Even though he learns his lesson, not every shallow man or woman is going to be hypnotized into seeing what true beauty is. But there are some really great laughs that Shallow Hal provides, it's also just a heart warming romantic comedy. It's something different and the cast really made up for what could have been a disastrous movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has an open mind to a different kind of comedy with some good laughs.7/10",Shallow Hal
31,=G=,Wow! Gwyneth really had to gain weight for this flick.,7,3 July 2002,"""Shallow Hal"" is yet another fresh, creative, and controversial comedy from the Farrlley Brothers. With Black in the title role as a superficial dating single, the film shows us what happens when self-help guru Tony Robbins gives Hal a post-hypnotic suggestion which changes his perception such that everyone's outward appearance is in rapport with their inner beauty. An intelligent flick which illustrates the strange similarity between comedy and tragedy, ""Shallow Hal"" is a love it or hate it flick which has left many saying ""I don't get it"". The only way to find out if you'll get it is to watch it.",Shallow Hal
32,MovieAddict2016,"A ""Shallow"" Script and ""Shallow"" Laughs make up ""Shallow Hal""...",6,19 December 2002,"I have changed my mind about ""Shallow Hal"". In my old IMDb film comment, I said that it was ""okay."" I now look on ""Shallow Hal"" with utter hatred. Well, not really. But it isn't that funny. Jack Black should probably stick to co-star roles, and Gwyneth Paltrow must have been out of her mind. Or out of her fat suit. I'm not sure which. I am not offended as most were by the depiction of the overweight and obese (kindly put). I don't get mad at the Farrelly's for their ""humor."" I liked ""Dumb and Dumber,"" because it rides the line of taste and gross-out humor. It's more controversial. When you cross the line of disgusting humor, no one thinks the film controversial anymore. They just find it gross. I think when a film's not funny, a film's not funny, and ""Shallow Hal"" is not funny... Anyway, the film has a throw-in sentimental ending to make everyone like the film. It also tries to capture what so many people liked about ""There's Something About Mary,"" but it fails miserably. Crude, ""original"" humor is what it tried to get. You'd expect the audience to be saying: ""Oh, Jason Alexander's spine sticks out and he has a 'tail'. The Farrelly brothers must've thought that's funny. I better laugh. Har... Hardy-har-har."" I have heard a lot of that: people attempting to laugh at the jokes because they are expected to. It's pretty bad when a comedy comes to the point of forced laughter. Farrelly brothers, you should have agreed to make the ""Dumb and Dumber"" sequel, because ""Hal"" is a waste of time.1.5/5 stars --John Ulmer",Shallow Hal
33,Robert_duder,Shallow Hal is REEEEALLY Shallow...and yet somehow its endearing,8,13 July 2010,"I want to hate Shallow Hal. My reason for wanting to hate it is because on the outside it appears to be a story about a really shallow guy (who has ZERO right to be shallow) learning a lesson about inner beauty and not being Shallow and yet beginning to end the film still manages to be entirely shallow. Everything is done in overboard enormity for Shallow Hal making everything seem silly and overblown. So after all this being said I couldn't bring myself to hate any of it really. As shallow as Hal and the rest of the movie is, somehow you find yourself smiling, and enjoying watching Jack Black make a fool of himself. I don't believe Shallow Hal is actually trying to truly teach any sort of moral message but rather just being rude and funny and silly while perhaps mocking the moral message? I certainly would never watch Shallow Hal with any youngsters of even impressionable teenagers but for an adult comedy you might just find yourself falling in love with feeble minded, but well meaning Hal.I'm sure the amount of variant opinions of Jack Black could fill a small Island in the Pacific but I am usually a fan of his performances. He is always silly, always slapstick, and always entertaining. He is about as serious as Jack Black gets in Shallow Hal and he pulls off the role well. Gwyneth Paltrow is really terrific as the over-sized Rosemary but she also has an over-sized heart. Paltrow as Rosemary is sugary sweet and her and Black have a funny and sweet relationship although it certainly doesn't paint Rosemary (the heavier one) in a very good light. Jason Alexander plays Black's best friend and as much as I think Alexander is a talented performer his role in this film is simply unlikable. He is incredibly shallow, and barely likable but maybe that is the point I don't know. Still this isn't his best character for sure. A host of really amazing cameo supporting characters make the film even more fun including Joe Viterelli as Rosemary's Dad, Tony Robbins as himself, and Zen Gesner in some of the stronger roles.If you really wonder what Shallow Hal is like all you have to do is look at directors The Farrelly Brothers. Their comedy is at the height of crude humour with sort of a Family Guy like quality to their stories. Shallow Hal is all about fat jokes, mistaken identities and Jack Black looking silly which might not work under all circumstances but somehow Shallow Hal makes it work. I can promise you that someone who is self conscious or sensitive about types of humour will not appreciate Shallow Hal but when all is said and done there is a happy ending and a seemingly romantic ending so it might be enough to appease the critics of the content but until then it is just entertaining and nothing more. Certainly shallow but oddly entertaining. 8/10",Shallow Hal
34,dromasca,"Boring, Not Funny",6,16 September 2002,"Quite a non-interesting comedy. Beyond the gag of having the slim Paltrow play an overweight, there is not too much fun in this film.The saying 'see the interior beauty' is translated ad-literam when a bachelor confesses his problems to a TV host and wizard (?). From this moment he does not see any longer the real physical appearance of the opposite sex persons, but rather their true soul. Is the world better? Apparently yes, for him, but not for the viewer. The story is not convincing, and the film fails where any romantic comedy should succeed - making us identify with the characters, and see the darlings the way they see it. This simply does not happen, and even the excellent Paltrow marks a low in her acting career. A film to forget. Avoid it! 6/10, and I feel I was generous.",Shallow Hal

36,inkblot11,"Although the cast makes it worthwhile, the film's attempt to leave the shallow end of the pool fall flat",6,19 August 2008,"Hal (Jack Black) was told by his dying father, long ago, that he should look for a good-looking woman when contemplating any serious relationship. Taking this to heart, the now grown-up Hal tries his best to entice a beauty, even though he himself is a bit chunky and short. But, when Jack has a chance encounter with motivational guru Anthony Robbins (the great one himself) in a stuck elevator, Robbins casts a mental spell on Jack so that, from here on out, Jack will see only a woman's inner beauty, not her outer self. Soon after, Jack meets the lady of his dreams, Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow), a gorgeous blonde, or so he thinks. What he doesn't know is that Rosie is very overweight, as seen by the ""real"" world, but he, Jack, can only see her sensational inner beauty. They begin a relationship, though Rosemary is quite baffled by Jack's never-ending compliments on her appearance. Jack's close friend, Mauricio (Jason Alexander), who had joined Jack many times on a quest for a beautiful girlfriend, is appalled by the change in Jack's perception and vows to do something about it. Will he succeed in destroying the budding romance? This is a film that has noble ideas and a great cast but ultimately falls flat in its attempt to go from the shallow to the deep end of the what-is-true-beauty pool. Yes, Hal is a shallow man who needs an attitude adjustment but the film's focus on the obesity of Rosemary ends up being exploitive, not heart-warming. However, Black and Paltrow make the film worthwhile, for Black gives a comically dynamic turn while Paltrow is beyond beautiful and touching as Rosie. Alexander does a nice job, too, and so does the gentleman playing Rosie's Irish father (someday I'll learn his name, he was a stitch as the mafia boss in Bullets over Broadway, too). The costuming is wonderful, especially Paltrow's sensational outfits, and the summertime scenes in Manhattan are very inviting. Therefore, the film's real problems are the script and direction, even though the overall movie is rather pleasant. This is because the subject matters of obesity and, to lesser degree, spina bifida, have been utilized for cheap laughs over real substance. Nevertheless, if you clamor for romantic comedy, day in and day out, do make the time to view this film. It does have a winning story of love to tell, even though it almost gets lost in a sea of exploitation.",Shallow Hal

Paltrow and Black had wonderful chemistry together, and the premise is certainly unique in my opinion, plus it's very well made and written.

It's also got some good dramatic moments as well, and it's good natured as well, plus the ending left me with a big grin on my face.

Even thought he doesn't score well for years with this approach, he has to wait an accidental meeting with a counselor to live the love story of his life (with Gwyneth Paltrow).With the Farellis brothers, you wait for a comedy: so the funny side deals with his Gwynelth weights about 150k & he is the only one on earth to see her as she actually is (about 50-60k, I think). Well, the point of this movie is not the exact weight of Gwyneth but tolerance.What defines beauty? Is it the physical appearance as media tends to prove it or the inside feelings? So, as you can see, there is more in the story than a mere comedy. Call it a philosophical romance or whatever, you will be disappointed if you only wait for the bad taste of the Farellis previous movies.

It's humor, though kind of stupid on paper, is realized with a most agreeable panache as the external reality and the subjective experience exist side by side.I can take this movie's application of saccharine a lot more readily than others because it basically does have a good message: don't be shallow. A lot of other dumb teen comedies are a parade of sex jokes that then jarringly seems to end with some paean to sexual monogamy leaving like ""what the hell?""Go in without a high nose and it's a bit of fun and Jack Black of course really brings it.",Shallow Hal
47,Chris_Docker,"Weak as a comedy, too cheesy as social comment, but a nice enough film",5,26 February 2002,"The makers of `There's Something About Mary' and `Me, Myself and Irene' come unstuck here in making a comedy that isn't really a comedy, and without the top acting talent and cutting script that made their earlier efforts such a success. Shallow Hal is hypnotized to see only the inner beauty in people. He subsequently proceeds to date exceedingly fat, ugly women whilst boasting to his mates about the gorgeous chicks he's pulling. Of course, he genuinely falls in love with one of said women and loves her even when he's de-hypnotised. If this wasn't cheesy enough, there's kids with in the hospital burns unit that everyone else shuns away from and only Hal can see the inner beauty. Gwyneth Paltrow, with a lot of prosthetic help, plays a woman of stunning beauty and also of dangerous proportions but, good an actress though she may be, funny she isn't. As a comedy, it's a one-gag movie; as a touching tale of seeing beyond the surface it lays the message on a little too thick.",Shallow Hal
48,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,"Romantic, funny, and heartwarming movie that's worth its weight in humor",9,17 November 2005,"SHALLOW HAL, in my opinion, is a romantic, funny, and heartwarming movie that's worth its weight in humor. If you ask me, Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow) looked very unattractive when she was grossly overweight. No offense, Gwyneth, but I liked the real you better than the grossly overweight you. The only thing that grossed me out was Rosemary taking large amounts of food, especially when she took a slice of half the cake that was served at Hal's (Jack Black) office one day. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, ""Never judge people by how they look. Judge them for who they are."" Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this romantic, funny, and heartwarming movie that's worth its weight in humor to all you Gwyneth Paltrow or Jack Black fans who have not seen it.",Shallow Hal
49,Boyo-2,Something for everyone to think about,8,1 March 2003,"This review openly discusses the movie so if you want to keep onto that element of 'surprise', stop here..Speaking of which, I am surprised how many of my fellow reviewers missed the point of this movie.  Possibly many of the immature (i.e., the majority) moviegoers out there don't like to see a comedy that has a message, or, going the other way, a message movie with some comedic touches.  Cause that's what this is.  The Brothers Farrelly cannot seem to shed their penchant for bathroom humor but this time they've given you something to think about.  There is some meat on the bones of this movie.  You're supposed to think about it when its over, not like ""There's Something About Mary"" which was just a straight laugh riot. Hal is shallow (surprise) to the point of blindness and gets an emotional makeover when stuck in an elevator with Saturday morning infomercial god Anthony Robbins.  He 'casts a spell' so that Hal will only see the inner beauty in a person, or not see the outside but only see the inside..Then he meets Rosemary, who is overweight and pretty non-chalant about it. She knows who she is and how she appears and already knows what Hal just found out.  She volunteers at a hospital, is in the Peace Corps and gives leftovers to a homeless man.  She's a good person.  Hal's friend Mauricio is even worse, and he has less of a reason to be so quick to judge another person.  That's one of the main points, that Hal or Mauricio, or anyone for that matter, are far from perfect just like the entire human race, and this point is brought home when Mauricio refuses to date a woman whose second toe is longer than her big toe!  Meanwhile, he sprays his hair on, wears Members Only jackets and has a deformity that makes a big toe seem much more preferable.  So he's not really in any position to be so critical, but he is..This movie has a HUGE heart and I kind of can't believe that the Farrellys coaxed a tear from me, twice.  Once when Hal re-visits the pediatric ward at the childrens hospital, and again at the end. I don't even like Paltrow but she's fantastic in this.  So are Jack Black and Jason Alexander.  The movie is not perfect and I can pull it apart but I feel more like praising it for what value it has rather than what they got wrong.  8/10.",Shallow Hal
50,triple8,Cute little pic-not great but good.,7,17 August 2003,"Paltrow's pretty good here, I enjoyed this movie a lot. Not great but certainly good, carries a nice message and it's a good premise.However, a lot of people did get offended by this. The movie kind of does that to itself-though the theme here is ""everybodys' beautiful"" etc etc and meant to look at how much women are judged by their looks, the movie wasn't as bold as it could have been. If it REALLY wanted to take hold of this issue there would have been more of the ""heavy paltrow"" not just a few quick shots. Shows the thin paltrow a lot more and it shouldn't. Does anyone get the feeling the movie was almost afraid of it's own subject matter? That's what takes the ""oomph"" out of the movie and makes it a sweet little picture rather then an outstanding film. Still, it's OK-I know many people, both heavy and thin who saw this, most were not offended by the picture but had the movie aimed for serious movie making instead of predictable Hollywood fare(the former would have been more appropriate for the subject matter at hand) the movie would have been a lot better.",Shallow Hal
51,Spleen,"Shaller, shaller Hal",1,5 April 2002,"See ""Shallow Hal"" with somebody else, anybody else, and I guarantee that you'll have something to talk about afterwards.  A LOT to talk about afterwards.  If the sign of a great film is that it provokes heated discussions, then ""Shallow Hal"" was probably THE greatest film of 2001.  But of course it isn't, and it isn't.  Probably the reason it's such a good conversation piece is that it's deeply confused, down to its very atoms (one example among many: Hal at the start is both insensitive to any virtues except physical beauty, AND wrong about what constitutes physical beauty, but the film treats these two faults as though they were one, possibly because it's just as guilty of the second charge as Hal is) - and it's hard to resist the impulse to dig through the rubble of mixed messages on the film's surface in order to uncover yet more rubble.  Even if I'm wrong about the content, though, what comes across most strongly is the Farrelly brothers' deplorable lack of cinematic and storytelling skill.  Yes, they're in many ways inspired writers, but they need to be placed under the command of a good director in order for their talents not to be wasted, and they're NOT good directors.  (""There's Something About Mary"" was pretty sloppy, too. I haven't seen anything else they've done.)The film has a decent ending, so we're liable to forget just how bad the rest of it was.  But cast your mind back and recall just how DULL everything was before Hal received his ""gift"" from the self-help guru.  The deathbed scene that ""explained"" why Hal was so shallow was contrived and tedious (it's not easy to be as tiresome as this in just two minutes), as was the scene in the lift, and neither they nor anything in between them was in the least bit entertaining.AFTER the lift scene, it's no longer boring; it is, instead, excruciating torture.  Hal looks at unattractive women, some plain, some truly hideous, and sees them as beautiful (correction: he sees more or less ordinary specimens of the Maxim magazine type, which he mistakenly thinks of as being beautiful; I'll agree that they're not UNattractive), so when Hal chats these women up, there's a constant dissonance between what he thinks is going on (his comments about appearance are obvious allusions to her beauty, the stares he's getting from others are stares of envy), and what everyone else thinks is going on (his comments about appearance are either cruel jokes or misguided attempts at charity, the stares he's getting from others are stares of bewilderment).  It's like watching one of those contrived cross-purposes conversations that only ever happen in movies (usually, for some reason, in restaurants) - except that this one goes on and on for over an hour.  Hal is negotiating rapids with a blindfold on.  Sooner or later he will crash into something, and the longer he doesn't, the more unbearable the tension becomes, and the greater the affront to our common sense.This is not the KIND of tension that can be used to good effect; in fact, it isn't used to any effect, except to make us uncomfortable.  When the crash comes, and there are no longer any cross-purposes left, it's a blessed relief.  That's why the merely competent conclusion seems better than it is.It's interesting, in a kind of a way, that there's just ONE truly gorgeous woman in the entire film (out of, I don't, fifty?): a guest at the party in the very last scene, the one in a blue dress who's standing a bit to the left as Hal and Rosemary get in the car.  She's barely in focus.  I mention this as an example of how bad the Farrelly brothers are at using images to make a point.",Shallow Hal
52,framptonhollis,Could have been great,6,3 February 2017,"I'm surprised that this movie has such a low rating, since I did find it to be genuinely charming and funny, much better an most modern romantic comedies. As a matter of fact, this movie was almost great, and it could have reached that level if only a few little tweaks and changes were made. Personally, I thought that the ending was an absolute bummer. It was overly sweet when it could have ended on a slightly darker note, which was the path that I felt the film was taking. Now I am not saying that this movies ending could not have been sweet, but it was so sickeningly cliché and obnoxiously over the top unrealistically happy that it disappointed me. A good example of a film ending that is both sweet and slightly tragic would be the ending of ""Chasing Amy"", another romantic comedy drama.Other flaws have to do with various jokes not really working and the plot of the movie being restated over and over again by characters to an annoying degree.However, the overall movie is surprisingly good and somewhat underrated. It is very funny, and juggles mocking and feeling sympathy for its characters really, really well. And I enjoyed the fact that the humor was not afraid to get super dark at times. The entire opening sequence is classic dark comedy!There is also quite a bit of heart and soul to this movie. Believe it or not, it actually,are me tear up a little at one point, very unexpected for this type of movie! I was impressed with the emotional conflicts and they had me really engaged and moved, but then all of that was screwed up by the ending!This is a movie that I would recommend, but with mild caution since the ending does largely ruin the experience, at least it did for me, anyway.",Shallow Hal
53,Kamurai25,"""Love Comes in All Sizes""",7,26 July 2020,"Really good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.Now, I'm honestly not the biggest fans of this cast: Jack Black, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Jason Alexander, but that's not to discredit their acting abilities, and I don't just limit that to these performances as everyone did a great job.Because of the complexity of the story itself, they clearly wanted to make this as silly and palatable as possible so everything essentially has rounded corners and rubberized edges. Hal is purposely left as a generic stock character to endear the audience as lesser but relatable, when it's actually a representation of the expectant audience. Mauricio is clearly a similar representation of our self-loathing, self-sabotaging selves: anytime we actually get something we think we might not deserve we take it away. Even Rosemarie is a generic representation of women's self-view (granted it is wildly simplified in this ""guy's"" movie), and by ""blurring"" the view between taught beauty (very clearly Jack learned from his dad) and personal connection you're able to find real happiness with people that might actually matter to you past an image.I and the movie aren't ""glorifying fatness"" (people say weird stuff), you should of course continue to work and be the best version of you that you can be, but ""but he/she/it is fat"" shouldn't be the only factor.It touches on real issues in the work and that ruins the escapism for me a little bit, but it does it in such a odd, fun, philosophical way it's easy enough to overlook.",Shallow Hal

So why do we after all come out of the theater with the sensation of having seen a movie that makes you feel well and cheerful? Because there is one thing that saves the it from total wreckage and that is the message conveyed by the second part which leads us to the conclusion that there are here two different movies in the same one.

57,m-47826,My favorite of the « worst » Farrelly Brothers movies.,5,3 August 2021,"The plot is very distinctive of one of their comedies. And is what attracted me at first. Only it is a very slow and messy movie. They don't seem too sure wether it's raunchy or romantic, so alternate both in a very random pace. As cute as the message may be, the way Rosemary eats, is very unhealthy and you can't help but wonder how long will she be able to last, with such a rich diet. So it kind of defeats the purpose of the happy ending, as it is clear she won't enjoy her beautiful love story much longer... I think they should've thought of that, before adding all these « yolo » comments, to further the character's psychology. Or make some viewers laugh. I do to some of the fat jokes, but the « inner beauty » thing is what I prefer the most about the movie. And what makes it so special. I think Jack Black is the perfect « shallow Hal ». And Gwyneth Paltrow gives her character more personality. None of the other actors bothered me. They do exactly what is expected of them and their parts. Molly Shannon's and Brooke Burns cameos added something more. I also like the town where it was shot, and think the soundtrack is one of the best of any Farrelly movies. Ivy doing the score, is a dream come true. But the official CD and some of the songs missing on it, is what makes it so good. Obviously, the early 2000s feel is no stranger to movie's charm, and you can easily see it as the last good one from the duo. But it is clearly flawed and not well thought out enough.",Shallow Hal
58,dunmore_ego,When Fat is Phat and Hot is Not,3,21 July 2005,"There's a horrible paradox eating at the heart of the movie, Shallow Hal.The film-makers' intent was to impart the message that ""inner beauty"" should make ""outer beauty"" irrelevant - unfortunately, that message is beamed through the prism of the visual media and  like it or not  as animals genetically geared towards choosing mates of visually-pleasing mien, we cannot effectively depict ""inner beauty"" without representing it as ""outer beauty"", thereby negating the supposedly noble message.Obesity, like cancer, or a thousand other nonessential genetic flaws in humanity's makeup, should not be EMBRACED simply because the person who is affected by it happens to be of pleasant disposition. Lying to ourselves that ""inner beauty"" overshadows obesity or gross disabilities (as traits that one seeks out in a mate) does not curb the desire to seek out mates of healthy proportions and faculties. From an evolutionary standpoint, this is the right thing to do.We don't make the rules  we follow them blindly. Good-looking people are geared to mate with good-looking people. Get used to it, or move to Arkansas.The hypocritical ""message"" of Shallow Hal is bludgeoned into audiences by stereotyping every character that Hal encounters into two molds: all ugly and undesirable women are inherently GOOD (volunteers for children's hospitals or minding their sick grandmas) and anyone with 10% body fat HAS to be ""ugly inside"". The clichés are so syrupy-thick that they cancel themselves out! For example, if you're going to compliment ugly women by implying that their ""true beauty"" is *internal*, then why does the movie portray Hal's perception of these ugly women as externally stunning? Because it is simply impossible for Beauty to be rendered as ugly, for then it wouldn't be  Beauty.Hal visits a hospital where he perceives all the children as charming jujubes - since when is every sick child a paragon of innocence and purity? Where are all those smart-mouth, precociously-slappable BRATS who populate Disney movies and PG-13 films? Jack Black, as Hal, assumes the mantle of romantic leading man surprisingly effortlessly, *his* body type speaking more persuasively for the positivism of the film's message than any of the extremities of type that the film subjects us to. He is not ""obese"", though not ""inshape"" either, yet commands respect and inspires desire in the opposite sex through his overwhelming charisma, talent and financial status. A perfect casting choice. Unfortunately, Gwyneth Paltrow as his leading lady, dilutes the ""message"" of acceptance through the paradox of representing Ugliness as Beauty.In a scene where Hal dances with three women who are, in reality, hideous, we realize that though he may see the inner beauty of *other* people, HE is still simply trying to get laid. The whole point of seeing other people's inner beauty is to find that quality within *yourself* that would SEE that beauty.Hal also initially pursues Rosemary because he is aroused by her lithe body, and when he achieves his sexual conquest of her, he still perceives her as svelte  which raises more issues: when he is later un-hexed and perceives Rosemary in obese reality, how does he retain his sexual fervor? She did not gradually balloon over years of marriage, or bear a child and retain the weight - her elephantine girth was thrust upon him instantaneously. Hal was never aroused by obesity before  yet everyone lives fatly ever after.But we're not simply talking ""fat"". Fat is okay. Obese is not. Obesity is a medical condition considered unhealthy, overstressing the body's cardiovascular system, bone structure and  through sociological factors  even mental health.Rosemary is ""morbidly obese"" through over-eating, meaning that she is battling deep-rooted psychological demons  how then could she be so ""beautiful inside""? This movie sends a message that this UNHEALTHY condition is acceptable, simply because this woman has some kind of sophistic ""inner"" beauty. Patently bogus on all fronts! And here's some news for the Fat Chick Brigade: Preferring an inshape woman to an obese one does not delineate men as SHALLOW. By god! - these pc-junkies with their insane rationalizing! So the MAN'S at fault if he prefers to bed someone who isn't directly related to Jabba The Hutt? So ONLY fat, ugly and deformed people have feelings worth sharing? (Tom Leykis notes: Only fat women have great personalities - *because they have to*!) It's perfectly fine for women to nag, ""Even if I'm FUGLY, you've still got to accept ME, for who I am!"", yet these same women WILL NOT STAND for a man demanding, ""Even if I don't make six figures, you've still got to accept ME!"" (Paraphrasing Leykis again: Men end up with women they can *afford*.) Ironically, Shallow Hal's grandest insult is aimed at fat people. When two mall-rats insult obese Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow in a fat suit) and Hal defends her, ""If you add up all the women you've gone with, they still wouldn't equal Rosemary!"", he is referring to the slim Rosemary HE sees, the metaphysically beautiful person that inhabits the physically fat beast - but in truth, the REAL GWYNETH PALTROW is unabashedly wallowing in the reality of that statement. And it's got nothing to do with her metaphysical beauty - it's plainly and simply her SMOKIN' BOD. The Farrellys hired Gwyneth Paltrow to sell tickets by LOOKING HOT whilst PRETENDING to be obese. Are we on the lip of outrage yet, fatties? The high-browed egalitarian concept of this movie cannot exist under the bone-crushing weight of Reality and the ""nobility"" of the film-makers is demeaned by the species itself, who would rather be hot than not.You wanna be noble?  be my guest!

Black literally sees women's ""inner beauty"" rather than their outward appearance. Gwyneth does as well as she can in the ""heavy girlfriend"" role, and there are some touching moments.  But this is pretty much a one-trick pony that has alot of time to fill, if you've seen the ad on TV you've basically seen the movie.

I found the montage of crew pictures and footage more entertaining than the film.My problem with Shallow Hal was that is was not up to the Farrelly Brothers biting humor. I never laughed once, and I am a HUGE fan of their work. I was really expecting something here and what I got was a mess.I was thinking that maybe if they took the last twenty minutes of the film and made it the first and had Hal ""recall"" how he got to where he was it might've worked. Then I thought that The Gweneth Paltrow character's showing was all wrong, maybe we should have seen Gweneth in the fat suit and glimps of her thin instead of the other way around. I was trying to make the continuity work but I just didn't care because it wasn't funny enough.I found Jack Black miscast as well as Jason Alexander who was nothing but annoying. I was looking forward to seeing Jack Black in a good starring role, I love his work, but this was not it. Many people will have problems with the idea of this hugely obese woman getting made fun of around all these shallow men. Well, duh!!! That's what shallow men DO. That was NOT my problem in a Farrelly Brothers film, what was -- was that I didn't care about her because Gweneth Paltrow was boring in this role, fat or thin. I just didn't believe her.This film didn't start out as a Farrlley Brothers film, it was mean spirited because the actors were mean spirited and this just missed the Farrlley Brothers ""bite"" to me.

But I thought this movie might be okay, because he plays a character who's basically being fooled, for a long time being clueless about what's really going on. And I was right. It worked. Jack Black is not a great actor, but now and again there are glimpses of actual acting there. In fact, if he tried to play characters very different from his real self (instead of the ones he's done so far, which are obviously just him playing himself), such as bad guys, I think he might have potential as a real actor.But anyway, the concept in this film was not bad at all. I was surprised by the Farrelly brothers here, because (predictably) I can't stand their other movies, which I find utterly devoid of taste, to say nothing of humor. Shallow Hal did have a little bit of the same stupidity, but not much. By and large it was quite sensitive and entirely enjoyable. I was captivated by the movie from beginning to end.My rating: 7 out of 10.",Shallow Hal
62,mattymatt4ever,One of the sweetest movies I've ever seen!,8,9 July 2002,"No contest, I will say this marks the best of the Farrelly Brothers.  Not because this film is laugh-out-loud funny--it's funny, but not hilarious--but because it has a great heart and delivers a beautiful message without any corny Hollywood pretentions.  Sure, the premise is funny--a shallow guy gets virtually hypnotized into thinking all the unattractive women he sees are foxes and ends up going out with a 500-pound woman who he also thinks is a fox.  It's a great premise, but the Farrellys don't fixate on that premise alone, preventing it from turning it into a lame, one-joke slapstick comedy.  This is a comedy with heart--a rare finding.  In between laughs, you really get wrapped up in the characters and storyline.  The gags flow quite naturally, without the Farrellys forcing any humor onto the screen.  If a comic opportunity comes along, they take advantage, but there's no random acts of slapstick.I am pleasantly surprised with Jack Black, who has proved in this movie that he doesn't only have what it takes as a comic actor, but also as a serious actor and a romantic lead.  I've always enjoyed seeing him on screen, but he usually plays the same wound-up, hyperkinetic characters.  Basically, he's funny, but you still know you're watching Jack Black on screen.  This time he exercises his ability as a method actor, he succeeds well.  Gwyneth Paltrow is adorable and sweet, capturing the audience's sympathy with her winning smile.  Joe Viterelli is amusing as her overweight Irish father, and actually pulls off a fairly convincing Irish accent.  The sizzling hot Brooke Burns makes a few appearances.  And Jason Alexander is always a joy to watch.I think ""Shallow Hal"" does the best job at conveying the message that beauty is on the inside.  It has been conveyed before in films like ""The Nutty Professor,"" but I feel this film conveyed it best.  This could've easily been a 105-minute fat joke, but it doesn't travel that route.  There are no crude or mean-spirited gags.  Could it be that the Farrelly Brothers matured?  Even of the films of theirs that I liked (ex.:  ""Dumb and Dumber,"" ""There's Something About Mary"") are a little uneven and contain a few gags that are just plain cruel.  Like in ""Mary,"" Cameron Diaz's brother is mentally ill and the butt of a few jokes.  Here, we have a character that walks on both his arms and legs, but he's portrayed as a normal character, and not as a gimmick for some cheap laughs.  There are moments that really tugged at my heartstrings.  The ""burn victim"" scene brought quite a few tears to my eyes.  The story is solid, with no boring lulls.  And the soundtrack is pretty good--I have criticized the Farrellys in the past for using crappy music in their sountracks.If you're looking for a good romantic/date movie with some good laughs and a good message, ""Shallow Hal"" will be an absolute delight.
My score:  8 (out of 10)",Shallow Hal
63,Beta_Gallinger,"Really funny for a while, but it doesn't last",6,17 April 2010,"I remember the first time I ever saw this Farrelly Brothers comedy was in the summer of 2004. It had been nearly three years since the film was released, but I had never even heard of it until just before I watched a rented DVD copy of it that summer. Jack Black's starring role in this movie was the reason why I was interested in seeing it, as it had been less than a year since I had gone to see ""The School of Rock"" in the theatre, which made me become a big fan of the comedian. I remember my first viewing of ""Shallow Hal"" very well, but don't remember finding it very funny at all. Nearly six years later, I've finally seen again, and I thought it was good for a while this time, but it certainly wasn't consistent enough to be 100% satisfying.At the age of nine, Hal Larson sees his father dying in the hospital. Reverend Larson is not himself due to all the painkillers he has taken, and just before he dies, he tells his son to only date women based on their physical appearance. Because of this, Hal grows into a very shallow man, only going after physically attractive women, while his shallow best friend, Mauricio Wilson, does the same, and neither of them has been romantically successful this way. One day, Hal finds himself trapped in an elevator with famous self-help specialist Tony Robbins, who hypnotizes him, making him able to see inner beauty! Hal now sees inner beauty as outer beauty, meaning whenever he sees anyone who happens to be good-natured, they look physically beautiful to him, even if they do not look this way to most people. He soon meets a young woman named Rosemary Shanahan, the daughter of his boss, Steve Shanahan. In Hal's eyes, she is good looking and svelte, even though she is actually morbidly obese. The two of them fall in love, but Mauricio really wants the old Hal back, which could lead to trouble!The movie starts with a sequence showing nine year old Hal and his dying father, and this part didn't do much for me, but after that, the story skips forward to Hal as an adult, played by Jack Black. We also have Jason Alexander playing Mauricio. The comedic talents of these two definitely help with the laughs. Early in the film, they say some really funny things, such as Mauricio's reason for breaking up with a certain woman. It's steadily funny for a little while, but eventually loses it. For some reason, I didn't find the relationship between Hal and Rosemary (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) that interesting, at least not around the time it begins. There are also some unfunny obesity gags, such as Rosemary breaking a couple restaurant chairs, and the same character jumping into a swimming pool and sending a kid flying from the water up into a tree. These aren't the only failed attempts to be funny. We also hear Mauricio talking about his turd at one point, and there were definitely a number of other parts where I kept a straight face, though there were more times when I laughed, even if they were sporadic, and the serious scenes don't hurt the film.I watched this 2001 Farrelly Brothers movie for the first time in years after doing the same with ""Kingpin"", an earlier comedy of theirs last month. During my latest viewings of these two films, they both turned out to be a mixed blessing to me. Both of them certainly made me laugh at times, but I could have laughed more. However, even though neither of them is as popular is the brothers' 1998 smash hit, ""There's Something About Mary"", I think they're both funnier than that vastly overrated romantic comedy. ""Shallow Hal"" does have its humorous moments as well as some good serious ones, and it also has a message about how physical appearance isn't everything, though the Farrellys' irreverence could offend a lot of people and make the message seem insincere to them. It's certainly not politically correct, but comedy doesn't have to be that in order to make me laugh. I just wish this particular politically incorrect comedy had more laughs.",Shallow Hal
64,jhclues,Surprisingly Insightful Film from the Farrelly Brothers,9,6 August 2002,"Without question, a lot of people are not going to like this film and are going to be put off by it.  On the other hand, it's going to come as a pleasant surprise to others.  The former group will be those who came to this movie hoping to find a title character to whom they can relate, thus enabling them to go on to bask in the gratification of cheap shot humor and infantile, adolescent perspectives that no doubt served them well throughout high school, and which, unfortunately, like a caterpillar unable to evolve because of some impediment of nature, they have been incapable of shedding as adults.  The latter, probably after some initial resistance-- inasmuch as the Farrelly Brothers seem to be tackling a rather sensitive subject this time out (and `sensitivity' is not necessarily their milieu)-- will for whatever reason find their way to this film, only to discover that the Farrelly Brothers actually have something worthwhile to say, and moreover, that they say it extremely well.  `Shallow Hal,' written by Sean Moynihan, Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly, and directed by the Farrellys, uses the parlance of our times, as it were, to examine the old axiom that true beauty is, indeed, more than skin deep.  It's a universal message, it's important, and it's delivered by the Farrellys with humor and poignancy, and in a way that is altogether effective.In no small part due to some deathbed `pearls of wisdom' offered to young Hal (Sasha Neulinger) by his father, the Reverend Larson (Bruce McGill), Hal carries with him into adulthood a rather, well...'shallow' sense of what constitutes perfection, especially when it comes to the opposite, fairer sex.  And, with a good friend, Mauricio (Jason Alexander), constantly reinforcing (with his own shallow perspectives) those put forth by the late Reverend Larson, it has not placed Hal (Jack Black) in good stead with the women he encounters.  Relationships elude him like the proverbial sands through the hourglass, and he can't figure out why. Then one auspicious day, on the heels of yet another rejection, Hal gets stuck in an elevator with none other than writer and motivational speaker Tony Robbins, the `Mahatma of Motivation.'  And, after hearing the sad story of Hal's misfortunes with women, Robbins uses his powers and wisdom to do something about it.  He gives Hal a gift:  The ability to see the true beauty that resides within another person, beyond the often deceptive physical attributes that are in reality no more than a facade masking who that person really is.  For the first time in his life, Hal's eyes are opened, and it isn't long before he meets the most beautiful woman in the world, Rosemary Shanahan (Gwyneth Paltrow), with whom he quickly falls desperately, deeply and passionately in love.  At last, he's happy; it's like a fairy tale.  The question is, can this particular fairy tale possibly have a happy ending?The Farrelly Brothers, known for their cutting edge, over-the-top visually graphic gross-out humor in such films as `There's Something About Mary' and `Me, Myself and Irene,' have reined it in drastically in this one, and to great effect.  To be sure, that trademark Farrelly `touch' is present (there is some bathroom/locker room humor), but in this case, it serves a purpose beyond shock value entertainment.  If you've seen the trailers for this film, or any clips from it, you get the idea that this is typical Farrelly Brothers fare and that there is no way that the characters involved are going to possibly emerge unscathed from it.  But what you see in those previews is basically the elements the Farrellys use to define their parameters and set up the message they want to deliver.  And it works beautifully.  They succeed in establishing Hal's misguided perspectives, as well as those of Mauricio, and from that base springs the emotional connection, empathy and compassion generated by the rest of the film as the story unfolds.  What we find, is that Hal isn't such a bad guy after all, once his eyes are opened; that a new perspective and changed attitude has served to reveal that better part of himself, as well as others.  And that, perhaps, says something about all of us.  Upon reflection, if it is possible to perceive the real beauty of another, maybe it works both ways.  As this film so succinctly points out, we, as a society, have been so programmed by peer pressure, the media and all of these inconsequential external forces, to equate `beauty' with all of the wrong things, that we all suffer for it, in one way or another.  And the message here is so clear:  What a wonderful world it would be, if only we could all see past the meaningless things and just see one another for who and what we really are.  Like a sage old man on a mountain, the Farrellys have crafted and delivered a layer cake, chocolate sundae of a movie; there's plenty of whipped cream on the top, but once you work your way to the center it's even better.  It's their way of using contemporary trappings to point the way to the divine mercies and offering a taste of the rewards that go to those who are wise enough to discern their meaning, and to act upon it.  Unfortunately, the `Shallow Hals' in the audience are going to get lost along the way, and it will be their loss. And that certainly is not a criticism; it's just the way it is.As Rosemary, Gwyneth Paltrow will absolutely win your heart.  It's a performance that evokes empathy and compassion to the point that you desperately do NOT want to see this girl hurt in any way.  And Jack Black gives a performance that, quite frankly, is going to surprise a lot of people; there is more to him than meets the eye.  In fact, that about sums up `Shallow Hal'--  a surprisingly insightful and inspirational film.  9/10.",Shallow Hal
65,educallejero,Manipulative? Cheesy? But also funny,6,18 September 2018,"Manipulative? Yes. Cheesy? Yes. It gets the message a bit wrong, even with the best of the intentions? Yes. 
But its also funny, probably the best Jack Black (with The School of Rock), and its also funny. 
Like movies about difficult topics (or at least a bit potentially controversial), it simplifies the world to give a ""good message"".Here, all the ""not beautiful"" people on the outside were just the best of the people, so Jack Black's characters sees them as externally beautiful, because he's hypnotized to only see the interior. That's good (you just have to suspend your disbelief when he can see someone as skinny model like and not notice anything when he hugs that person). But the movie offers no greys. I guess it is because it might ""muddle the message"" for some, but the movie ends up saying that all the people that isn't beautiful on the outside is great on the inside. That's just unrealistic and a bit childish, and lowers the ceilling for the movie. 
The same happens on movies that touches race. The ones discriminating are racists (or sexists or whatever), and are perfect and never discriminates other people themselves, when we know that's not how it works. I didn't overthink this movie when I watched it, and it was good.",Shallow Hal
66,Stampsfightclub,Average predictable romantic comedy,6,11 September 2006,"From seeing Jack Black in 'King Kong' and 'Enemy of the state' I knew he had some talents and when I watched Shakespeare in Love I knew that Gwyneth Paltrow was a very good actress so why was this film awful? Jack Black stars as Hal, a womaniser who only goes for the best looking women but is hypnotised to fin a woman's inner beauty instead. Hal then meets an obese woman, Rosemary, played by Paltrow, and the two start going out.Since Hal's perception of women has been altered he can only see beautiful people. So instead of seeing the 'real' figure of Rosemary he sees an attractive woman which is why he chooses her.Its an extremely predictable film with terrible acting. Paltrow is always trying to recover her ground and create sympathy which never works. Jack Black disappointed me most of all because he was given a character who cannot be funny as much as he tried. EVERY SINGLE joke in this film is predictable and amazingly unfunny, I could not bring myself to laugh as much as I tried, it's a one liner joke all the way through and in one word is disgraceful, for actors of the quality in Black and Paltrow it is such a step down for the pair.The story is very captive of real life and flows well with healthy relationships between characters but again I must stress that it is very predictable and not funny in this slightest. It is actually very sick minded with fat jokes streaming continuously from the characters.The beginning is awful  where it should be really emotional it is supposedly funny and makes me cry with disappointment that a real emotional scene has been created to sound funny and I was put off from that scene  the young Hal with his father in the hospital bed.Its likable in the sense that it is very captive of real life and shows that there are characters like that out there who are exceptionally rude and arrogant. The ending provides a few twists which many may have seen coming but are likable and is emotional  and is the only reason why this film receives a 6  because it is emotional and audiences may question what is happening Heavy critics may see the ending as tacky and clichéd but I found it enlightening Worth watching if you have nothing else to do  not a film I would recommended to watch on a date - watch 'when Harry met sally' which is laughable, predictable but that IS funny and contains good acting  unlike Shallow Hal which for me was a disappointment to what I was expecting",Shallow Hal

Well, meet Tony Robbins, and now Hal can see women for who they truly are, making their inner beauty appear as outer beauty, but only to Hal.Shallow Hal is hilarious!

In other words the more worthy the person is, the more she looks like a fox in his eyes. To others they remain as they really are!One of these films (like the Nutty Professor with Eddie Murphy) that you don't really have to see, you just watch the trailer and you have seen it. The central joke (a person living under false illusions) doesn't really bare scrutiny, after all how could it work? If a twenty stone woman lay on top of you I'm sure that you wouldn't think she was Gwyneth Paltrow!While this sort of material plays well on TV, it must look very thin on the big screen. Paltrow (out of ""fat"" make-up) is quite charming, although employs a body double rather than be seen in a thong!(I thought suitcases were the only thing that had false bottoms!)So fat people wear big underwear, crush chairs at restaurants (after which the managers humbly apologise for having their furniture damaged) and make big splashes at the swimming pool! This is laughs of a TV level and given that so many Americans are overweight, hitting out at quite a number of the target audience.Jack Black makes the most of probably the only starring role he will ever have and Paltrow doing nothing but mouthing words is worth watching, but otherwise the cupboard is bare.What is the message, that being overweight is OK as long as you are a nice person underneath? What about the health dangers? What about the limits it puts on your life? What happens if a building catches fire or a car runs out of control at you?This film is a curiosity piece in that it gives mixed messages: It wants to crack fat jokes (Paltrow grabbing half a cake and stuffing it in her mouth) and then say, hey, if you love someone it doesn't matter.People that grab half a cake and stuff it in their mouths are pigs rather than nice people. Although, to be fair, this is only the film makers trying to milk the last drops of their one and only joke.Despite the many negatives, this isn't that bad and at least throws in a few good tunes to help pass the time between the ""big knickers"" gags.",Shallow Hal

When a stranger hyptnotises one of the men into using his brain over lust, he learns what true love is -- in the form of a larger woman and the boss's daughter, a woman that society does not consider attractive because of her size. Meanwhile, learning that his friend is getting women for personality over attraction, the friend becomes upset over feeling that he has lost his womanizing counterpart and tries to set things straight. The film is all about shallowness and learning how to make things right and learning what true love is. It is also a comedy because it pokes fun at society and unattractive people, but it also suggests that no one is perfect. This is the sort of film you just want to watch once, and it's pretty shallow in that way: once you have seen it, you are not missing much.",Shallow Hal

So as far as Hal is concerned, he's still being shallow.
In order to be funny, Farrellys had to represent his ""learning not to be shallow"" as just a visual impairment where he hallucinates fat people as skinny. Its the only way the comedy would have worked, yes, but its fairly offensive.The movie is still saying that these people are disgusting, and that only someone who has been brainwashed would want to be with them.

Jack Black is one of cinema's most wanted and best comedy actors now, here he shares the screen with Gwyneth Paltrow, a extremely failing actress that who's career has been going only down since late 90ties.SHALLOW HAL is a flirting comedy that's got a new twist to it. The nice idea is great. We meet Black that only sees women from their looks, but so he learns something from a famous psycho doctor. He learns him how to see inside people, and see the inside as their looks. Black learns this, and soon he sees all the fat women as slim and sexy. All the smoking women as flash points. And so on...It's a funny comedy, although it hasn't got the extra touch that would have made it a very good comedy. Jack Black is as always very good in his character, he never fails. Paltrow is okay, although she fails a lot more than she succeeds. And, when you have this plot going, there are off course easy to put on all of these ideas. Like them having a milkshake together and Black looks out the window for a moment, and when he is about to drink it's all gone cause of Paltrow! Or when Black is laying in the bed waiting for Paltrow, he sees this thin lady and her small panties, and he tells him to take them off. So she does, and throws it to him, although the panties look small and cute to him, they're really huge!It's a very entertaining movie, although it never gets that nice touch that would have helped it a lot in its way.

Gwenyth Paltrow puts together a great performance, she is the only reason that this movie is bearable. Her sensitive, thoughtful portrayal of Rosemary shows her talent. The way she uses her eyes, focusing on Hal or avoiding her father, is subtle. Her posture shows a lot about her character, the way she is always covering herself with he arms.

75,nicholas.rhodes,Excellent and Original Idea,8,2 May 2003,"After several viewings I have come to the conclusion that this is an original, sweet, very intelligent and very romantic film, despite all these traits not necessarily being apparent on the initial viewing. Unlike most of the people writing here, I had no preconceived ideas about what the authors of the work were going to do as I had not even heard of them (Farrelly). So, discovering this film was like discovering Farrelly.Like it or not, for some strange reason which I will never understand, Western Europeans and Americans have been been brainwashed thru media and the like to think that ""Fat is bad"" and that ""Thin is Good"". In absolute terms, there is no logic or basis to this, beauty and attraction being NOTHING to do with body size, but the fact is that whilst the idle rich of Europe and the USA ( mostly women who have nothing better to spend their money on) spend thousands of dollars, pounds or euros having their flab cut off, their breasts increased or their faces lifted, people in poorer countries are desperately looking for the wherewithal to buy something to eat. Thus is the logic of the human race and it all goes to show that beauty is a TOTALLY subjective perception which has absolutely NOTHING to do with body size but is a pure product of media influence and nothing else. You can be sure that cavemen and cave-girls surely had completely different criteria for beauty and/or sexual attraction from those dictated by current-day western society.The interesting thing about this film is that it changes this perception in the life of one man, Jack Black, who sees as ""beautiful"" ladies whom everybody else in society, following media diktats, see as ugly or unattractive. This is the best part of the film and Jack Black acts this part to perfection, genuinely amazed that others cannot perceive the beauty in these ladies that he himself does.Unfortunately this ""state of grace"" comes to a rapid end when his stupid friend ( who deserved more than a punch in the face !! ) decides to selfishly meddle in matters and go and see the guru who converted Jack Black to this state of mind.The rest of the film does show the ""beauty of the heart"" as winning the final battle but not without some unpleasant moments beforehand.Cynics will argue that to make the point, the film makers used Gwyneth Paltrow incarnating all the stereotypes of the supposedly perfect woman ( i.e. tall, thin and blond ). This is indeed true and includes ""manipulation"" in itself, but for the needs of the film ( assuming the film is to be shown in W Europe and USA ) we may admit it was probably the strongest way of getting the idea across.I personally have never paid attention to the physical beauty of someone on first sight and have found that the more you know a person, the more you talk with them, their ""physical"" beauty actually changes either for the worse or for the better, depending on the character they reveal to you and the compatibility of that character in relation to your own and what you are expecting. This obviously means that the perception of beauty actually takes precedence over the physical traits themselves - and this perception is modified as and when the other person opens their heart to you ! I had never actually seen a film dealing with this subject and was delighted that someone had actually taken the time to study it and make this film - which to me comes over as highly intelligent and well thought out. I had never been expecting a laugh-out-loud comedy and would not have enjoyed it if it had been thus.I am sure that with time the film will gain in importance and will no doubt be treated as a ""curiosity"" in about 100 years time when the wheel will have turned and ""fat"" people will be considered the norm and the thin or slender people as ""ugly sods"" ! The film does contain some humorous moments but these are minor compared to the general thread which is one of tenderness and kindness. Any person who feels that he or she is ""outside"" the politically correct physical standards dictated to western society by the media and by fashion shows etc. and therefore ""out on a limb"" so to speak should take the time to watch this film. It does show that true beauty is really in the eye and the heart of the beholder and NOWHERE else !",Shallow Hal

77,FlickJunkie-2,The Farrellys grow up,8,13 July 2002,"`Shallow Hal' is a touching film with a noble message; that beauty lies within.  The approach is novel if not a bit contrived, but it works in this genre.  The normally coarse Farrelly humor has been toned down considerably and the film is full of quiet chuckles with only a few guffaws sprinkled in. Noticeably absent (thank heavens) is the profanity and body fluid humor.The Farrelly brothers (Directors/Producers Bobby and Peter) have made names for themselves by producing juvenile gross out flicks (Dumb and Dumber, Me, Myself and Irene, Say It Isn't So) targeted at teenage audiences.  Most of these were as successful as they were low brow.  Of course they also had a smash hit with `There's Something About Mary' which offered both their irreverent humor and a captivating story.  Also lurking on their resume is the little known, `Outside Providence' which is a sensitive romance that one would never associate with this tandem.  Given this background, `Shallow Hal' is something of an evolutionary film for the Farrellys.  They took a chance making a `grownup' film, though they paid for it at the box office. For this I must give them a great deal of credit.This is a much more subtle and refined Farrelly vehicle that synthesizes many of the best elements of prior films, making it their best effort to date.  Hal's transformation from an immature and superficial jerk, to a caring and substantial person might be analogous to this film as a turning point on the Farrelly's resume.  One can only hope that this experiment is the beginning of a maturing process for two very talented directors, rather than validating to them that you can't make as much money making good films as you can trash.The acting is excellent.  Jack Black is a pleasant surprise as the main character.  He has the range to play both sides of the character effectively, alternately giving us great superficiality and great depth.  He is also extremely funny with a great variety of facial expressions and physical comedy that make him that much more endearing.  Gwyneth Paltrow just seems to get more beautiful with each film.  Her acting here is once again top rate, giving us a touching performance with equal parts of insecurity and sensitivity that one would expect from the character.  Her chemistry with Black is also terrific.  Jason Alexander adds his odd humor to the mix and gives the film some of its funnier moments.I have been critical of the Peter and Bobby Farrelly in the past, but to this film I say, `Bravo'.  I rated it a 8/10.  With any luck this will represents a direction and not a temporary detour from the puerile comedy that made them famous.",Shallow Hal
78,moviesleuth2,The Farrelly Brothers made a sweet-natured romance? WTF?,7,26 February 2010,"When it comes to movies, the Farrelly brothers have a reputation for outrageous, raunchy, low brow comedy that appeals the the lowest common denominator in all of us. So it comes as a surprise that the Farrellys made a gentle romance...and it actually works.Oh, there's some of their trademark humor in the film. But it's more toned down, and while the film is undeniably light-hearted, the focus for the main part of the film is the romance between two people.Hal (Jack Black) is an immensely shallow bachelor. His standards for what qualifies as datable material are so high that they must be heard to be believed. Unfortunately for Hal, he's no Brad Pitt. After a chance meeting with self-help guru Tony Robbins (as himself), Hal's views of women are turned inside out. Now, how they are on the inside is projected (to him, at least) on the outside. What I mean is that good people look like bombshells to Hal, and the jerks look like hell. Then he meets Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow); to him, she's a goddess, but to others, like his equally shallow pal, Mauricio, she's a two-ton blob!""Shallow Hal"" is about perception, and the difference between that and reality. People's visual appearance is only half of what makes a person who they are (if that), and that's something that Hal learns over the course of the movie.The two leads are great. Jack Black is surprisingly effective in a semi-dramatic role. We totally believe him as he tries to swoon Rosemary, who not being the blond bombshell that he thinks she is, believes he is making fun of her. As his opposite, Gwyneth Paltrow is simply radiant. She's a good person with a good soul, and while in other hands Rosemary may have turned out to be a caricature of Mother Theresa, Paltrow keeps Rosemary believable. Black and Paltrow have excellent chemistry together, and in a film that focuses more on the romance than the comedy, this is especially important.Supporting players like Jason Alexander, the late great Joe Vitrelli, Susan Ward, and of course, Tony Robbins, are great as well. Jason Alexander is great as the best friend whose shallowness is a response to his insecurities. Surprisingly, Tony Robbins is very effective, and not uncomfortable in a performance, but then again, this is kind of what he does for a living.The Farrellys have a reputation for being politically incorrect, and proud of it. And while there's some of that here, the people who make the jokes are shown to be stupid and shallow, or in the case of Rene Kirby (a womanizer who walks on all fours because of his spinal bifida), making fun of themselves. This avoids the trap of making the film exploitative or offensive.There's nothing especially noteworthy about this film, but it does do what it tries, and overall, it's a fun movie.",Shallow Hal
79,famousgir1,Good cast in an average comedy.,6,1 February 2002,"Shallow Hal is about Hal, a guy who is a womaniser and is only interested in beautiful women, more than a women's personality. When Hal gets trapped in an elevator with famous Tony Robbins and explains that he has no luck with women, Tony tells him that he shouldn't only look for the womens outer beauty, he should look for the women's inner beauty too. He then hypnotises Hal, into seeing a women's inner beauty and any 'ugly' woman Hal will meet will be pretty to him outside as well as in the inside. In comes Rosemary, a rather large women, who Hal sees as a beautiful woman. They get along great and start seeing each-other, but when Hal's just as shallow friend, Mauricio then un-hypnotises Hal, the big test will be to see if once Hal finally sees what Rosemary really looks like, will he still want to be with her.
Shallow Hal stars, Jack Black, Jason Alexander, Gwyneth Paltrow and Sascha Knopf. They are all great actors/actress' and they give good and believable performances in the movie, which is one of the main things that makes the movie what it is.Yes, the Farrelly brothers have a really strange and sick humour, so when you go see one of there movies you expect that, but most recently each time they bring out new movies, they get weirder and cruder each time. I'm not really sure if I really want to see any more of there 'new' movies. Shallow Hal is not exactly a brilliant movie, but definitely better than some of the Farrelly brothers other work. One of the reasons, being the cast in the movie who are brilliant in there roles and even though the story-line to Shallow Hal is not exactly fantastic, I guess, it's different and provides a few laughs at times. Some people may find this movie  funny, others may find it offensive. It's bound to have different opinions from everyone who watches it.

I can't wait to see his next work!Gwyneth Paltrow is an ANGEL!  Words cannot describe how beautiful she is, and this film definitely does her credit!  She's quite a good actress too...I guess that's why she got an Oscar!Jason Alexander is quite good as well.  I don't know what's up with his stupid hair-piece throughout the film, it's nasty!  But, I guess that is what they were going for.  Anyhow, Jason plays an interesting character in the film, and pulls it off quite nicely!The rest of the cast is good as well.Anyhow, if you are a fan of the Farrelly Brothers, than I definitely recommend seeing this film, but keep in mind that the humor is quite ""cleaner"" in this film, not so much gross-out-humor.  If you aren't a fan of the past Farrelly Brothers films, than you may still want to check this film out, because like I said, the humor is a little bit different than their other films.

The Farrely brothers did ok making it but it wasn't their best like There's something about Mary, Kingpin, and Dumb & Dumber. Jason Alexander was good though, like when he was pooping and saying stuff or when he was saying something about wonder woman. If I was Jack in that movie, I would've picked his ex-girlfriend. She's flaming hott. What's the matter with you, Jack!! In a way, it wasn't really funny. I mean nothing really funny made me jump and laugh real hard. I think this film could've done just a little bit better.

82,Antagonisten,Crap,2,21 September 2005,"The Farrelly brothers have made quite a career for themselves with movies that have always been quite nasty and childish, but also with warmth and heart. These two factors have balanced each other quite nicely and made it bearable to watch movies like ""Dumb & Dumber"" and ""Something About Mary"". Unfortunately it seems that special touch the brothers had must have gotten lost somewhere around ""Me, Myself & Irene""...Messing with stereotypes is a big part of what the Farrelly-brothers do, as well as disarm them with a few laughs. The fact that they were going to take on the stereotype of fat people vs. beautiful people therefore didn't feel so dangerous. But i don't know what the brothers were up to here because i don't understand where this movie is going. Hal (Jack Black) is a man who only loves thin and picture-perfect women who are like models for what is considered beautiful. To help him see the inner beauty of people he is hypnotized to completely disregard looks and of course he immediately falls in love with a hugely fat woman (Gwyneth Paltrow in a fat suite). He doesn't see her as a fat woman though but as a beautiful thin woman (Gwyneth Paltrow WITHOUT the fat suit). Now answer me how that disarms the stereotype?! Since obviously hugely fat women are disgusting Hal needed to be hypnotized to ever even look their way... How does that tell you everyone can be beautiful? Since this is a movie i don't have to tell you how it all works out, but saying that it feels far from realistic is not too far fetched.Simply put it feels to me like this movie is rather reinforcing stereotypes and making fun of the very people it intends to ""help"". The whole ""beautiful on the inside""-thing doesn't work one bit and every joke made on fat peoples expense (like drinking a pint of Coca-Cola in ten seconds - Ow, brain-freeze!) just pushes this further and further down the hill.My sincere feeling is that you can joke about anything, absolutely anything! But it has to be done in the right way and this is not it. Insulting people, making fun of them in a way that is degrading more than anything... This is crap and the Farrelly-brothers should do better than this. 2/10.",Shallow Hal
83,EmperorNortonII,Heavy Comedy,6,17 December 2001,"Some people call ""Shallow Hal"" a love letter to fat women, and a message about inner beauty.  Others say it's offensive to fat people, among others. Well, the Farrelly brothers were never notorious for trying not to offend anyone!  Granted, some of their humor is low-brow, but a few laughs surface. I enjoyed Jack Black's character of Hal.  One thing I noticed, after his character meets Tony Robbins, he tends to see superficiality in others that he revelled in himself, not even noticing his old self in it!  Anyway, it's one of those stupid movies with a tiny bit of intelligence.  The importance of inner beauty cannot be understressed.  Maybe ""Shallow Hal"" is too sloppy a movie to be delivering such a high-minded message.",Shallow Hal
84,Horror-yo,Better than you'd think,7,6 December 2016,"It's the sort of mainstream comedy you immediately grasp the concept of just by looking at the poster and tagline. But here, the mere narrative in itself isn't the film. It's not as predictable as anticipated, and despite its total thick mainstream comedy atmosphere it actually isn't that unrealistic, despite the totally far-fetched elements, and the film makers made a real effort to make this stay together fairly plausibly.The criticism: same as for 'Stuck Together' - another Farelly early 2000's film - this comedy is a tad too long though not boring at any moment, focuses on the story a bit too much and thus forgets about the humor; this really could've used a lot more funny having Jack Black in it and the Farellys behind the set. But the morality sticks out in a healthy, pretty handsome sort of way here in the end, rather than it feeling totally facile or force-fed as in other such comedies.",Shallow Hal
85,bregund,"Kinda sweet, kinda stupid",3,18 August 2005,"Jack Black doesn't have the screen presence of your classic fat leading men such as John Candy or Chris Farley. He's not funny, insightful, or original, and his screen presence is flatter than the pizzas that he eats five times a day. It's no wonder that his popularity as an actor is so heavily reliant on his mediocre acting skills, bulky figure, or slack-jawed mumbling; you can see this same person sitting in the computer section at any Kinkos. It is this person with whom people are supposed to identify, so it doesn't say much for mumbling, overweight Americans. He always looks like he needs a shower. That's why the premise of this movie is so false; what woman would lower her standards far enough to date him? The movie tries to simultaneously enlighten and ridicule, and the result is curiously flat, as vacant and soulless as George W. Bush's apelike stare. There's some dumb stuff that doesn't quite work, like Jason Alexander's tail (whuh?). Speaking of Alexander, it's difficult to watch him without seeing George Costanza, but here we see a George who isn't even slightly funny and in fact is really creepy. As hilarious as his self-centeredness was in Seinfeld, here it is flat and empty because he doesn't have the checks and balances provided by skilled actors; instead he quarrels with Tony Robbins, who will probably never win an academy award and whose timing is even worse than Black's.If the actors and dialogue were better, the film could have been better, but even then there are problems. Sight gags pop up one after another: Rosemary breaking a chair, Rosemary jumping into a pool and causing a huge wave, Rosemary in a lopsided car. Then in the next scene there is some wrenching moment where she's on the phone with Black, realizing that he's no longer interested in her. Just when you feel bad for her, they do some other stupid sight gag. This movie contradicts itself so many times, the sight gags just don't work with the dramatic moments, it's like they took an old Jerry Lewis movie and tried to make it socially conscious.As crappy as this movie is, there are some sweet moments, like the end when they finally get together, or when they sit down and eat together, or visit her parents. It's too bad there is so much childish humor in this movie, it could have been really good with the right actors and screenplay.",Shallow Hal
86,DavidSim240183,The Farrelly's get tender,8,14 February 2007,"The Farrelly brothers may be the kings of gross out humour. But they do have the ability to rein themselves in and get on with telling a story when the need arises. Shallow Hal may be their most heartfelt and sincere film to date. Its the one film where they (for the most part) restrain their penchant for sick jokes and crass humour, and actually concentrate on characterisation for a change.Shallow Hal is basically a one joke scenario. It takes a very simple conceit of a superficial man hypnotised to see the inner beauty of others. Where fat people look slim and gorgeous. Burn victims look fine. And psoriasis sufferers don't have to worry about flakes.If Shallow Hal were content to milk the fat jokes for all they were worth, it would have quickly run out of steam very early on. A pitfall most one joke movies fall into. So its to the Farrelly's credit they took a different approach and transformed it into a sweet and appealing fable about appearances and matched it with the right actors so it becomes a comedy of surprising depth.Jack Black is Shallow Hal. And in his first leading role, he does quite well. Showing he's got what it takes to carry a film on his shoulders. Bringing confidence, his usual zest, and likability to the part of a selfish cynic. Hal was taught by his father on his deathbed to only go for the most desirable woman. In other words, beautiful and sexy are the ones to shoot for. Ugly and unattractive is a no fly zone.But where the film really shines is Gwyneth Paltrow as Rosemary, the 200 pound woman who suddenly appears slim and nubile to Hal. Paltrow is one of my all time favourite actresses, and she gives Shallow Hal its life and vitality.A sweetly appealing performance, Rosemary has learnt to accept her weight, but when Hal shows an interest in her, she at first thinks its out of pity, especially when he keeps passing her compliments about how beautiful she is.Of course Hal really believes her to be a beautiful woman. So his interest in her is genuine. Something that does wonders for Rosemary's self-esteem. Gwyneth Paltrow was a real good sport with some of the things she was asked to do. Donning a fat suit and tons of makeup, her performance is worthy of special mention because her sweet optimism continues to shine through.Not to mention she is the butt of several fat jokes, such as giant sized thongs, benches collapsing under her weight, and clearing a pool of water when she dive bombs. But the fact that she convinces us of her weight is what makes Rosemary more than just a caricature.The real theme of the film is Hal's journey of self-discovery. Its quite a balancing act, but the film is remarkably successful in keeping Hal's growth plausible. It all reaches a turning point as Hal is de-hypnotised and sees Rosemary for what she really is. When Hal tries to avoid her, there are times when I felt like thumping him.The resolution is never in any doubt. Hal will come to his senses and come to love Rosemary for who she is. And not have to live up to his expectations. The final image of Rosemary carrying Hal in her arms is amusing, even if things do get a bit predictable towards the end.Still, Shallow Hal is my favourite Farrelly film. Its not just a film about fragile overweight people. Its aspirations are broader and a little more nobler than the average Farrelly film. And worth seeing for the sight of a man with a tail. That's worth the price of admission alone!",Shallow Hal
87,Idocamstuf,"Really, really bad",2,2 June 2002,"When I went to see this movie at the theatre, I was almost sure it would be funny, because every other Farally brother movie has been hilarious. This one wasnt funny. I think the problem is that they tried way to hard to be funny, with Jason Alexander making stupid fat jokes, which made this movie very offensive as well.

88,Enrique-Sanchez-56,Shallow People Need to See This Movie - It's what's inside that counts....,9,4 December 2001,"I can identify with this movie.  I've had weight problems all my life, except 15 years of my adult life where I have finally turned things around to please societal standards of what good looking is.  I have not become shallow - I have given in.To be fat in this ugly, mostly shallow world is not a pleasant experience. This movie not only throws that in your face, you are asked to wallow in it. I think it's a good thing to see this movie.  Perhaps most of the negative reviews have come from shallow, thin people who never had a problem wearing a bathing suit or undressing in a locker room...I am not sure, but it's a distinct possibility.I am waxing philosophical because I cried at the end of the movie.  Yet during the movie, I did laugh.  Perhaps I cried because it struck such a thunderous chord in my heart, perhaps because I enjoyed the way it ended.  I laughed at the some of the funny lines and situations I heard...only because I knew them too well in my heart.  I had been there before.Yes, the movie does reveal to us just how empty we can be.  It's an inverse ugly duckling story that reaches into one's psyche when least expected and hits us with some subtle wallops.***MINOR SPOILER*** The one scene I will remember out of all of them is when Hal (Jack Black) returns to the Children's Burn Unit at the hospital where Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow) works and he encounters Cadence, the young burn victim.  It is very much like the completion of a musical phrase that the child's name suggests. Hal's reaction reaches into your heart and tugs it.  And you know that Hal has grown. ***END***I enjoyed all of the performances, except with minor reservations- the one by Jason Alexander.  I do believe his characterization might have been drawn too broadly - but he was the need foil in the plot and he played the part as required.  All in all, the Farrelly's have done it again.The musical score was well wrought and the choice of two great old songs really added to the enjoyment of the movie:  The Foundations' ""Baby, Now That I've Found You"" and Edison Lighthouse's ""Love Grows"" (Where My Rosemary Knows"") I recommend this movie to anyone who has ever felt not quite right about their appearance and been ignored, insulted, and hurt by others' reactions.

90,bix171,A Leap Forward For The Farrelly Brothers,8,3 August 2002,"The Farrelly Brothers seem to finally have figured out the cross-pollination of their bathroom humor with Hollywood feel-good shtick and the result is their first fully realized film, a likable comedy about a loser (Jack Black) who, under Tony Robbins' spell, sees only the inner beauty of women, disregarding their outward appearance. There's plenty of the Farrellys' trademark good-natured ribbing of deformity (here it's spina bifida) and weirdo gags (the best one involving an overgrown spine) but the film as a whole doesn't revel in the bile that pushed `Me, Myself & Irene' over the edge into discomfort (especially concerning its racial attitudes). It's also not as laugh-out-loud funny as `There's Something About Mary', preferring to concentrate on pacing and motivation--but that works towards a more satisfying film: it has less of the dead spots that the outrageousness compensated for in `Mary'. Black is a surprise in a lead role: he delivers his lines with an unexpected sweetness and sincerity that belies his non-leading-man looks. With Gwyneth Paltrow as the object of Black's desires; even though she spends much of the film playing a grossly obese woman, she still plays it straight, leaving the humor to Black and Jason Alexander (as his best friend) and the Farrellys' sight gags. `Shallow Hal' will probably put off some Farrelly Brothers fans for not being funny enough, but it represents a great step forward for them as real filmmakers.",Shallow Hal
91,jldmp1,Bubble Boys,4,7 July 2006,"'Seinfeld' reruns are the only funny things on TV these days, the only things really worth watching -- they far outclass any sitcoms the industry has churned out since Jerry and Larry folded up shop all those years ago. Alexander started with Woody Allen-isms and developed 'George' into a legendary comic figure with his own identity. Naturally, someone's going to try to pick off something meaty and use it for the movies.It's not such a stretch, considering these directors wrote a 'Seinfeld' episode that can be viewed as a microcosm for the whole series -- hint: Paltrow plays a 'virgin'; i.e., the series is bookended by (the abortive attempts at) the making of itself...something that easily transposes to the movies. Consider such off the top of the head examples as ""The Muppet Show"" and ""The Player"".But this is a failure. Seeing what a poor job Alexander did trying to translate 'George' to this, it makes me think the whole thing was completely misconceived, that the rich 'Seinfeld' ideas just don't work in this medium. Or it least it's beyond these guys.The central premise had enormous potential to be funny. But all we're left with are some thinly spread situation jokes. And they bind up the 'date movie' arc with Black's career arc with the 'best friend' arc...it's OK at best. But they did get the scantily clad women right.

92,deepfrieddodo,Deep Beauty for Shallow Hal,8,3 November 2021,"A film that probably wouldn't be made now, Shallow Hal may have faults but is fun with endearing characters and a great message hammered in throughout.The clear controversy is that people who are stereotypically unattractive are labelled as 'ugly' and suggests that these people only have worth through their inner beauty. But the whole film rallies against this sentiment, this belief is displayed as the fault of the lead, rather than those victimised. The moral of the story is clear, and although crudely done, still a pleasant one.The actual content itself is pretty good. Certainly a very different approach than other romcoms, but therefore a lot funnier, without being hilarious. It's also early enough in Jack Black's career (at least as a lead) that the character isn't heavily shaped around his mannerisms, and he fits Hal well.It's nice, easy and refreshing.",Shallow Hal
93,squirrel_burst,A big heart makes up for the hit-or-miss comedy,7,18 April 2015,"""Shallow Hal"" is a mix of a very sweet and earnest love story with a comedy that often doesn't really work. I was won over by the fantasy love element and I do think it has more appeal than it doesn't. The idea that the titular character Hal (Jack Black) is a shallow guy who gets hypnotized into seeing women as they are inside instead of what they look like on the outside. He begins falling in love with Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow), a fat woman that has a big heart.Alright, that premise doesn't really make any sense because how could Hal know what people are like on the inside unless he knew them intimately, and unless the hypnosis also messed around with his sense of touch and his strength, there's no way he wouldn't realize that his vision is all kinds of screwed up, but let's just get past that. I feel like there's some good potential for humor with this premise, like if say a hot shot celebrity had an ""ugly"" sister and Hal confused one for the other, or he was a makeup artist (or even funnier, a plastic surgeon) and he started going crazy with people's faces even though they didn't need it. I'm sure you can come up with some good ideas too. Not a lot of the potential is used here. What we do get plenty of is exactly what you would expect from the premise. Hit or miss jokes about Hal thinking that some ladies are hot while everyone around him stands dumbfounded, fat jokes, and visual gags of seeing beautiful women looking at big clothes or plates full of food and they don't even have the courtesy of coming in quickly enough to build off of each other and make you laugh.What saves the movie, and I would say actually makes it legitimately good is the love plot. As a fine male specimen with impeccable features that regularly has to fight the ladies off with a stick, you might not think that a story about an insecure lady who has been ignore her whole life one day discovering a man that falls head over heels for her would necessarily phase me, but it really did. If you've ever felt like you were judged because of what you looked like on the outside, that part of the movie will really drive home and it will make you smile. This comedy could have dropped the ball badly by handling the hypnotism thing the wrong way, making it feel like Hal is simply tricked into loving her, but without giving away what exactly happens during the conclusion, I felt like it handled that potential problem very well. This could have easily become a tasteless, mean-spirited mess, one that gets its laughs at the expense of ""unattractive people"" and I'm glad to say that it doesn't. The conclusion really pulls it all together and makes the shaky premise work. Overall ""Shallow Hal"" isn't of the Farrelly Brothers' funniest film but it probably is their most heartwarming.

After this, Hal finds it much easier to meet beautiful women, and meets the girl of his dreams, Rosemary (Paltrow).

It was always watchable, likeable, of a good cast & easy to follow. Unfortunately it wasn't funny or particularly gripping. The 'members jacket' joke (if joke is quite the right term) went way over my head. I still don't get it now, must be an American thing. You knew with this film the overiding message would be that not all gorgeous people are beautiful inside & most fat & ugly people are nice & kind. Fair enough, there's a lot of truth in that, but it shouldn't detract from the fact that (illnesses excepted) obesity is often brought on by total lazines, not a particularly endearing quality & in its' extreme, can kill.

It could have been filled with flatulence jokes, non-PC situations (I have to agree, I expected and wanted more of those) and the like. But it was not meant to be a gross movie (thankfully), and as such, it surpassed my expectations.The highest point of the film was the one with the children in the hospital. It was like a wake-up call for me - ""hey, that's the way EVERYONE should be treating everyone else!"". Also Hal's friendship with Rene Kirby's character and their scenes together were quite touching and remarkable for one thing - the way the whole movie shows you your physical appearance shouldn't affect the way you socialize with everyone else. Very, very cool point.Sadly, the film suffers from many situations which leave you wondering. You never get to see how the nurse in the hospital really looks like; also, you never know what happened to Walt's date. When Hal realizes he has been ""hypnotized"", you never get to see how he leaves the restaurant without being noticed.

The movie is about Hal(Jack Black) who is an extremely shallow guy thanks to his father who said that you can only love good looking women.

Overall this movie is very good and the Farrely Brothers once again proved they are one of the best duos for comedy movies.

100,Aidan McGuinness,A one joke movie that's enjoyable but quite unmemorable,5,14 February 2002,"""Shallow Hal"" has a simple enough premise - Hal Larson is a shallow individual who only ever goes after unattainable women until he is hypnotized into seeing ""inner beauty"", which leads him to pursue the grossly overweight Rosemary Shanahan, who appears as a slim Gwyneth Paltrow to his eyes.This movie is a lot more subtle than your typical Farrelly comedy. By this it's about as subtle as being hit on the head with a shovel, as opposed to a mallet... The movie's message about ""inner beauty"" is shamelessly promoted throughout the movie - whether it's the leading lady, or the sick kids in a hospital, or the members of the local Peace Corp., we are constantly being told how beauty is only skin deep. Ironically the not-beautiful appear as beautiful people which seems to somewhat contradict the message they're trying to promote. I enjoy Jack Black and he does what he needs to perfectly. Paltrow isn't exactly taxing herself here - smile, simper, cry - and we're done. Adequate but not noticeable.Of course a comedy is pointless if it's not funny and ""Shallow Hal"" suffers from one being a one joke movie - watching Hal's befuddlement as he tries to comprehend how his ""beauty"" gets picked upon, breaks chairs, splashes loudly into pools, etc. The scenes with the kids in hospital aren't so much funny as sickeningly saccharine. The ""fat joke"" element begins to wear thin - there's only so many times you can play a particular gag (namely the ""broken chair"" and ""you're so beautiful"") before the humour tends to grate a little. The gags also suffer from either having appeared in the trailers, or being more obvious than the Lord of the Rings getting Oscar nominations. There are some genuinely funny moments but from these brothers I expect a bit more and it wasn't delivered.""Shallow Hal"" isn't a *bad* movie. I did laugh but I could have done with the over-stated moral of the tale - it's not done with much fine handling. The movie would have been better if it had been tightened up, been less obvious about it's message, and tried to find another means of humour. As it is, it's a bit of fun but can only get 5.5/10, placing it slightly above average. Go and see their other work like ""Dumb and Dumber"" or ""There's Something About Mary"" instead.",Shallow Hal

There are many funny moments in ""Shallow Hal"". Jack Black proves to be a revelation in this role. He's much more confident and amusing than other lead actors working today.

104,MF210,You kind of wonder if this was made by the Farrelly Brothers,5,14 December 2003,"My Rating: ** out of ****. The preview of Shallow Hal made it look hilarious. Unfortunately, the movie Shallow Hal is anything but that. There are very few laughs in this film and when you do laugh it wont be very loud. The Farrely Brothers have been known for their gross out comedies. Dumb and Dumber, Theres Something About Mary, and Me, Myself and Irene were all entertaining and at times hilarious comedies. Kingpin is actually the only movie of theirs I do not like. However, Shallow Hal is not gross out at all (except for one scene at the end). To some this may mean the Farrelly Brothers are maturing. However, in my opinion it gives Shallow Hal a complete lack of energy. In the last 20 minutes the movie really wore out any welcome it had. The Farrelly Brothers have always worked with diverse actors. They have worked with Jim Carrey, Jeff Daniels, Ben Stiller, Woody Harrelson, Randy Quaid, Cameron Diaz, Lauren Holly, Renee Zellwegger, Chris Cooper, and Lauren Holly to name a few. Here they are working with Jack Black, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Jason Alexander. There really not as succesful with these actors. Jack Black is always fun to watch but he like the movie is lacking energy. Jack is entertaining to watch but we know he could do better. Gwyneth Paltrow is very much miscast here. This is not her kind of role nor the kind of film she would appear in and her bad performance speaks for it. Jason Alexander can be hilarious(check out Seinfeld if you doubt me) but he is not given alot to work with here. He could be hilarious but the material the Farrellys have provided is weak. The Farrelly Brothers seriously needed to give the film the energy they gave to some of their other films. Shallow Hal really becomes unbearable in the final twenty minutes.

One of the pleasures in watching any movie for me is not having a bunch of stuff to pick apart when it is over.On the other hand, there wasn't a lot in the movie to make it special - though Jason Alexander is always good for a few laughs. But, it was a pleasant ride through the mind of someone who has to come to grips with something we all have to come to grips with - that being reality versus fantasy. Or better yet, the vices of superficiality.Frankly, I think that every person who thinks they have to drive a cool car or wear cool clothes should be chastised as much as someone who thinks they can only be seen with ""cool"" people. It is a good movie for making the point that when you are a sheep - like most people - you will eventually get led to slaughter. And, for those of us who aren't sheep, we say the sooner the better.",Shallow Hal
106,llihilloh,"All wrong, everything's wrong....and it's not funny!",3,15 January 2003,"Ah, a film from the morons who gave us 'Me, Myself & Irene' and 'There's Something About Mary.'  Both of those movies truly were horrible as was 'Shallow Hal', a film that had one of the worst pair of actors I have ever seen and boring jokes that fell flat at about 50 times per minute.I am officially done with the idiotic Farrelly brothers.  I just don't get them.  'Dumb and Dumber' was at least tolerable and so *not* annoying. That was probably their best film yet, and that's not saying a whole lot.
The main problem, which probably only exists in my mind though I don't know why anyone else wouldn't see it from my point of view, is that the casting was all wrong.  Gwyneth Paltrow.  Gwyneth Paltrow a 300 pound woman?  Come on, what has happen to this gal's career?  I'm not a big Gwyneth fan, but she at least knows SOME good roles when they do, indeed, roll around. It's bad enough when Paltrow, an actress who earns millions and millions of dollars and can have the pick of probably any script, goes for a film that is as lame as this, but why, oh why would Jack Black be cast in a lead role. Somebody please explain this to me because I am having a difficult time grasping the idea of Black actually getting paid for being such a jerk. He is annoying and one of the worst so-called comedians to come around Hollywood in a while.  Never would I ever pay to see him in anything again. Not even in a film in which he has three lines.I found 'Shallow Hal' to be one of the most boring comedies I've seen in quite some time.  The supposed jokes aimed to make the audience laugh fell flat like an anvil.  I laughed....maybe twice, but I'm being generous. (Jason Alexander's performance evoked the most laughter from me.)  As bad as 'Me, Myself & Irene' was, it at least made me chuckle, despite the fact that it was asinine and seemed as if it had kids working behind the cameras.I know that a lot of people have come down hard on this film mainly because it picked at the overweight population.  Okay, what exactly is the problem? For those who ARE overweight and just find this movie to be so insulting, why don't you go out and actually do something about your weight instead of sitting around typing about it?  For the others who just didn't like it because it targeted obese folks, if you didn't want to see a movie like that, you shouldn't have gone and saw it.  I mean it's not like you didn't know what the movie was going to be about.  Alright, enough of that, let me get back on track.Well, I guess I AM done.  Gwyneth Paltrow shouldn't have signed on, Jack Black is just a jackass and if you want laughs, go rent something else, anything else.  Did the previews look good?  Obviously, or I wouldn't have gone out and coughed up a couple of bucks even though it was a complete waste of time.  The best thing about this film happened in about the last two minutes; it's where the song Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes) plays. Love that song, can't get enough of it.  Oh well, at least it was a nice way to end such a terrible movie.",Shallow Hal
107,atzimo,"Clever, funny, with substance, best comedy of 2001",10,30 January 2003,"'Shallow Hal' proves the genius of the Farrelly brothers. Instead of taking the downhill route of following their own imitators ('American Pie(s), Road Trip etc), they create this brilliant comedy that takes the genre to a new dimension. (Note: They DID try to get into that gross out comedy race though, partially with 'Me, Myself and Irene' which failed in so many ways).This movie takes the well known fact that beauty is subjective and combines it with the saying that only inner beauty matters. To me anything more about the plot would be revealing too much; you should see the movie for yourself to fully enjoy it.Gwyneth Paltrow is excellent, so is Jack Black in his first leading role. The rest of the cast is the usual Farrelly cast that is always so marvelous. Also some of the most beautiful girls ever on film parade from time to time.One thing that has to be clarified: This movie DOES NOT make fun of overweight people. The Farrellys are not hypocrites nor politically correct, but that doesn't mean that they are cruel. Fat people shouldn't be patronized by anyone. This would be the real insult. And that goes for every Farrelly movie.Finally I just wanted to say that 'Shallow Hal' came as a surprise to me. I never would expected the Farrelly brothers to have so much artistic power left to be able to rise above today's low standards in comedy with yet another gem, which in my opinion is the best movie of 2001.",Shallow Hal

109,Pavel-8,Worse than I expected.,2,14 March 2003,"**Warning! Mild Spoilers Ahead!**I didn't expect much out of 'Shallow Hal,' and I got significantly less than that.First of all, the very premise is convoluted.  By saying that when seeing the inner beauty, one sees a Gwyneth Paltrow-like person, that contradicts the attempted statement that beauty is not based on external appearance.  IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE!That was difficult enough to get over, but even beyond that, the movie was awful.  Jack Black was never given a chance to cut loose, and his attempts at subtle humor failed miserably.  Jason Alexander...ouch.  He should have just quit after 'Seinfeld' ended.  George Costanza is one of the greatest sitcom characters ever, and Alexander can't break free from that stereotype. What the heck was with the tail?!  How ludicrous and unnecessary was that? 
Ignoring the fact that all of the fat jokes could easily be construed as offensive, they were entirely predictable and unfunny.  Even the almost funny moments were spoiled by the ubiquitous trailers. 
The only bright spot in the whole movie (I won't honor it w/ the title of 'film') was Gwyneth Paltrow.  I'm not a big fan of hers, but she tenderly and effectively portrayed most of the emotions that her character felt throughout a strange and awkward relationship.  Bottom Line:  Shallow is an understatement.  One of the worst of 2001.  2 out of 10.",Shallow Hal

Albeit a bit shallow itself, it has a good message that should be taken positively rather than as a condescending and pretentious flop.At times it can be a bit confusing however. Sometimes it seems sweet, other times ironic, and yet other times satirical - as in it is making fun of its own sweet premise.Of course it is just a shallow comedy so we should all lighten up and not get our knickers in a twist (I'm being sarcastic here) but imagine how it feels to be cast as the ugly, overweight, handicapped, or even scarred burn-victim knowing that there is another better looking actor playing the same character on the other side. No one needs the reminder, we all know we aren't attractive - thank you very much.Finally, no, life does not imitate art. Tom Brady is a great example of what real life is like and the movie is not. Just like Janis Ian sings in 'At Seventeen'.",Shallow Hal
113,jacksisjax,Paradoxical Mezz,6,23 July 2020,"Theres some things very wrong with this movie.
The first being it is a total paradox. The message of the movie is that looks don't matter, and people who only care about looks are bad! But... at the same time the movie is cracking fat jokes. You find yourself laughing at how ugly people are and the fact that this guy is ACTUALLY dating these women. And these are the reactions the movie is clearly trying to get from the audience. In one corner they yell ""Look shes so fat she broke the chair he has no idea what hes dating!"" and than in another corner they shout ""Hey dont make fun of fat people! Date people only based on their heart."" What a paradox. It does kind of take away from the message of the movie.
Another thing that kind of bothered me is that whoever wrote this seems to think all fat/ugly people are saints, and if you're pretty than you're the worst. What a SHALLOW mindset ;) . In fact i know more fat ugly jerks than pretty ones. Granted looks don't represent whats inside... but this movie seems to think so. Just the opposite of what people normally believe... which i believe is just as wrong. Which just adds to the paradox!!!
I also think physical attraction is important... call me shallow but i do believe it is important to be attracted to your significant other. Not that that's ALL that matters but ya know.Ive been rather harsh on this movie... It's not bad. I think its rather funny and creative. The concept is very original and they played it out well. The message becomes a little convoluted but other than that this movie is an entertaining fun watch.",Shallow Hal

I thought this film was ok, especially for a non-action one, since i prefer action. Jason Alexanderer and Jack Black are my two favorites in this movie, so at least the movie will be good knowing they are in it.
However, Jack Black probably wasn't best fit for that role. However, Jason Alexanderer brings back some of George's qualities from Seinfeld.

So when he falls head over heels for the vision of loveliness that is Gwyneth Paltrow, everyone else can see that she is not exactly svelte.This is easily the best romantic comedy to come from the Farrelly brothers, after the attempt that was Me, Myself and Irene, which was relatively amusing, but mostly crude. Accused by some people of being anti-fat, this film is actually an attack on male insecurity. It's also very funny.",Shallow Hal
118,Mr. Pulse,"Maybe not a great movie, but a very interesting one.",7,11 November 2001,"The Farrelly Brothers have probably made better movies, and they most certainly have made funnier ones.  But ""Shallow Hal"" is easily their most interesting.  That doesn't mean it succeeds in its own goals, or is even a completely enjoyable film; rather, there is a lot of interesting stuff going on in this movie just below this surface, and it's worth watching if for this alone.A personal favorite of mine, Jack Black, plays Hal, a nice guy who is very superficial about his relationship choices, thanks to some terrible advice from his dying father.  A chance encounter with a self-help guru turns Hal's life around; from now on everyone he meets appears according to their ""inner"" beauty.  Hence when Hal meets a large woman named Rosemary who happens to be funny and kind and giving, he sees a gorgeous bombshell (played by Gwyneth Paltrow).  Meanwhile, Hal's equally shallow pal Mauricio (Jason Alexander) is confused and angry about the change, and tries to figure out how to reverse it.I think the first thing that will strike audiences is this movie is definitely not as funny as Farrelly classics ""There's Something About Mary"" and ""Kingpin.""  But, it's also clear that it's not trying to be.  Almost all the jokes in the movie work well.  There just aren't very many of them. ""Shallow Hal"" plays less like a typical gross-out movie, than a very unusual, high-concept romantic comedy.But all that stuff aside, what interests me is the ""beauty on the inside"" message.  First, even though the movie clearly believes this is a good idea, and tries to relate this to the audience, they do so by showing inner beauty through the use of gorgeous super-model types.  How is this any better than just judging people physically?  Do people who are physically unattractive wish to be judged in terms of their looks, but on the inside?  And is something changing in our society that two films with identical messages are being released in the span of six months (The other is Shrek)?This is an interesting movie, and also a sweet and funny one.  Not really for Farrelly brothers fans, more for fans of traditional romantic comedies and also those who are interested in these questions about sexual identity and self-image in society.",Shallow Hal

Will Shallow Hal be a repeat?So the Farley Brothers makes a story about a shallow man who tries to get a date with girls that's ""out of his range"" and he just picks them cause of their looks but then after being trapped in an elevator with Tony Robbins, he helps him realize only the inner beauty. So from that point on he sees people that has a good personality but not too attractive people extremely sexy...he even sees nerdy guys like a pretty boy if they have a good personality which is kind of weird because Hal's friend Mauricio looked the same the whole time and he was complaining about his girlfriend's toe was unperfect and she still looked hot and he was being picky, shouldn't he had been really ugly like the nurse? I guess they couldn't make him ugly because if he looked different all of a sudden Hal would get suspicious already and the story would be over. Either that or Mauricio was already ugly so he stayed the same? Haha...The trailers showed some of the really funny parts so it got kind of old to me yet everyone laughed which was kind of odd because they showed like the swimming pool scene where Rosemary splashes and the kid goes up in the tree in the commercial so many times i couldn't laugh at that scene, they should of saved that one for people who were going to see the entire movie. But it's okay, there are plenty of really funny scenes that the trailers didn't show i guess.The movie was kind of messed up because Hal only went out with Rosemary in the first place because he ""thought"" she was hot, The movie was kind of saying the real sexy people are mean and the not too attractive people are nice which isn't always trueDid you notice Hal's neighbor was pretty the entire movie? I guess she had both inner/outer beauty... She was mean at first because she thought Hal was the type of guy that was messed up but she realized his inner beauty without seeing him as a pretty boy, now that is true love.This movie is obviously not real, pretty messed up sometimes, but became serious at times which would probably save the movie from complaints unlike the 'Nutty Professor' which offended a lot of people. The actors are nice and pretty entertaining, i would see this again and not be bored. Well, it didn't top ""There's Something About Mary"" but it was a decent movie, still worth the viewing.

121,Lando_Hass,"O.k,but not Farelly brothers material...",6,12 August 2002,"I think that Shallow Hal was merely an attempt to make a more touching film rather than a flat out gross comedy like previous Farelly films.I'm not saying that I didnt like Shallow Hal,but it didnt have much humor in it,it had a couple laughs throughout the film,and plus the monster cannonball splash was pretty funny,but when you think about it,this movie is mostly a touching story instead of a comedy.The character that Jack Black plays is Hal Larson,a man who gets hypnotized by someone in an elevator,and when he gets hypnotized,he only sees womens inner beauty,so when he sees fat women,he sees them as basically super models.Unlike his previous films,Jack Black changes from a numb skull low life,to a successful business man,but I dont think that Jack Black fits as that type of character.The character Rosemary(portrayed by Gwyneth Paltrow) is a sweet 300 pound lady who is contantly made fun of because shes so heavy,but Hal sees her as a the perfect woman,good looks and a great personality.The jokes in this movie are quite funny,but the jokes dont come up very much.In the beginning where Hal and Rosemary go out to eat,Rosemary's metal chair breaks,and that was pretty funny,but that joke is used too much,because a couple scenes after that,she breaks another chair at a resteraunt.The cannonball splash was also a very funny and original joke,because the splash is so big,that the little child in the pool flys all the way up into a tree.Overall,I find Shallow Hal a very entertaining movie,but since it was inended to be a comedy,but eventually turns out to be a romance,I didnt think it deserved anything above a 6.All the jokes are funny,but they dont come up in the movie very often.I give Shallow Hal,a 6 out of 10.",Shallow Hal

Hal does get ""fixed,"" and later broken, but then overcomes both and becomes a better person because of it.I enjoyed Shallow Hal because of the message, and the slight-of-hand that goes on (Hal sees perfection in the ""imperfect"", and vice versa). Important lesson for us all. ""5"" out of ""10."" Average, really, but that's not the point. The point is, this movie does make a lot of sense, and strikes a chord with us all once we see it. At least that's how I felt. I know what it's like being an outcast because of looks (and no, I'm not multiple hundreds of pounds in weight); but you don't have to be. Everyone goes through that sort of thing at one time or another. And, if we're lucky, we find the one person who sees past all that, to the inner us.In ""The Abyss"" the line is ""see with better eyes..."" It's a line I've often quoted. And it's true.

125,kellyadmirer,Good-natured look at a serious topic,6,2 December 2001,"During the 1930s, there was a brief fad of making movies with dogs playing human roles.  You'd have a bulldog dressed up as a gangster, a poodle as his moll, and so forth.  Pretty darn funny to see, even now, and a darn sight funnier looking at them now than their human contemporary comedies.""Shallow Hal"" also belongs in its own category.  Instead of dogs, it uses outrageously unattractive people (or, rather, people made out to look unattractive) to represent archetypes of ""good"" and ""bad.""  In doing so, it tackles obesity head on, a very sensitive subject for some.  Ultimately, it approaches this non-politically-correct topic in a politically correct fashion.  I class it with movies that tackle serious issues like racism and racial prejudice head on.  Those movies (think ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" though ""Hal"" is nowhere near the quality of that classic) get notoriety, protests, controversy, respect.  This movie will pretty much disappear without a trace.Why?  Well, it is marketed as a comedy, and, indeed, it is funny in parts. You certainly can tell when you are supposed to laugh, even if you don't (such as when Jack Black does his amazingly unfunny ""cuckoo"" impression one too many times).  There are, indeed, a few hilarious moments if you are in the right frame of mind (the ""Devils come out!"" line was completely unexpected and out of character and, thus, superb).  The trailer captures the vast majority of the real laughs.Comedy designation or not, ""Hal"" turns into something much different.  It has a sensitivity about human feelings that only belongs in a serious movie. It is as if the actors or writers slowly realized during the filming that this is a topic that can hurt a lot of people, so joking about it is not the right angle.  It would be like joking about racism.  That can work if done properly, but not when you poke fun only at real and obvious victims of racism.  Poking fun at the, if you will, victims of obesity comes to seem petty and lame.So, what are you left with?  An unfunny comedy?  Well, it would be easy to think that if bought your ticket - encouraged by the misleading ad campaign - expecting to bust a gut.  You won't.  Instead, you will see a fairly charming and introspective look at all of our human frailty, where characters are forced to look inside themselves to find out of what they are made.  Sounds fairly pat - ""appearances can be deceiving"" and all that - but it is all done in a good-natured way.  The fact that there are not ""political activists"" out there roiling the waters about this particular topic pretty much assures that it will not become any kind of cultural touchstone, though.  It will at most just be a guilty pleasure for some.None of the acting particularly impressed me.  Some of the people who were supposed to be physically ugly in fact looked kind of normal - which is a real commentary on how Hollywood itself views the world.  A little Jack Black goes a long, long way.  Jason Alexander was much better toward the end, playing the schlemiel who knows he's a schlemiel, than at the beginning, where he is just plain annoying.  As for Gwyneth Paltrow, how she wandered into this film is a mystery.  Rene Kirby steals every scene he can, and embodies the real moral lesson of the film.I noticed that some, ahem, overweight moviegoers were not laughing.  They took it quite seriously.  I think this kind of film rattles some cages.  Any movie that succeeds in doing that isn't all bad.  Compared with the utter mindlessness of ""Harry Potter,"" ""Legally Blonde,"" ""Bandits"" and the like, this is serious stuff.  There is a need for that in this day and age when sophomoric trifles are held up as the height of film-making.

It has a much deeper message than it appears. It knows when to be funny and knows when to be serious. Why so many people disliked it and why critics panned it is totally beyond me!The movie is about a man named Hal, played by Jack Black, who judges women based on their looks. He keeps failing at it and his attractive neighbor, Jill, even turns him down after he begs her to go out with him. The next day at his job, he's bummed that he didn't get that big promotion and happens to bump into Tony Robbins in the elevator while leaving his work. They get stuck in the elevator and Hal explains him his love life. Robbins then puts a spell on him to see the inner beauty in women so that he can judge a woman based on her personality. Suddenly, things starts to change for Hal. His best friend Mauricio (played by Jason Alexander) notices Hal's fresh new standards with his taste in women and doesn't like it one bit. Hal then begins dating a woman who is overweight named Rosemary, played by Gwyneth Paltrow. He sees her as a beautiful, petite woman and they hit it off. Mauricio, who is much more picky with women and more shallow than Hal, can't believe it.That's the plot for you and I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that the story is predictable and the characters are memorable. I can't give the cast enough credit for doing such a wonderful job and it's interesting to see Jack Black like you've never seen him before, departing from his usual slacker/stoner role that he's given.

He is only able to see women as sexual beings and can not see past their physical beauty. One day he gets stuck in the elevator with a talk show host( a huge hulk of a man!). Anyhow he somehow hypnotizes Hal enabling him to see beyond a women's 'outer beauty' and see 'the beauty within'. As a result, he is seeing fat or homely women as beautiful models. This is not exactly my favorite Farrelly brothers movie (that would probably be Outside Providence)but the outcome of his 'hypotnotic' state does have some funny results.

130,jason_13,"Original, moral and reasonable comedy",8,18 February 2006,"I rent the movie and had high expectations of course. The movies is very well known and it's probably Jack Blacl's most famous role even after King Kong. The story is about Hal Larson who simply loves chicks, but they usually don't like him. The typical case, but one day he falls in love with a 300 pounds woman, because he doesn't see her real personality. He sees her as a beautiful, smart and kinda pessimistic woman.The point of the movie is that people should look less and less for nice looking people with high self confidence, very specific taste and caprices. That happens all time everywhere around the world. It might have been said before, but I don't know how many people agree with it. Outer appearance sometimes doesn't matter although I am not 100% in agreement with this thing. It's important, cause in our early years, we have been looking at beautiful and sexy women and it's just something you could never let behind your back, but once you have such an experience as Hal does, you might change your notion about what is real love, what is a good woman or man and what is something you simply wanna be with for more than one hot night.Of course the movie introduces some strange moments involving characters and Jack Black is overacting in some scenes, but it isn't that much of a problem. The story and the point of the movie is something fresh and something that should make people laugh and think at the same time.",Shallow Hal
131,DorianWynHowells,"A funny film, with a touching message.",6,12 February 2002,"The Farrelly Brothers aren't exactly renowned for their sensitivity, but here they begin to show signs of some maturity. The premise is already cringe-worthy material. Hal, on choosing his girl's, places the bar a bit too high, and to be honest, he's no Johnny Depp. So after a chance meeting with a hypnotist who thinks that Hal is too shallow, he will from then on only be able to see the inner beauty of women, even if they are very large, or extremely thin! I liked this message, but at times during the film, I lost sight of the message, and fell completely in love with Gwyneth Paltrow.Now this is at both the right and the wrong thing to do. Hal only sees Rosemary as a slim young woman, who is very, very attractive. But if he saw the real Rosemary, he would run a mile! Yes, Rosemary is funny and witty, and that's what her inner beauty (Paltrow) reminds us of, BUT, if we keep seeing the Paltrow side of Rosemary, the actual 'real' her is just a shadow. It's a complex thing to put down on paper, but you'll understand when you see the film.Jack Black? This is his first major role, and to be honest, he carries it well. Although we know that Hal has a heart of gold, he's still shallow. And to me personally, he does annoy me on times. It's just...sometimes he's too much like Stiffler from the American Pie films, and those Jim Carrey impersonations? Perlease!!! Mind you, it is a Farrelly bros film!There are some great gags to be had, some really beautiful babes, mind you when Hal is under the 'spell', the really good looking ones are all very, very ugly!!! ugh! I have to say, what the film tries to say is embraced, as I do warm to it's message. There are two scenes to be had when I was truly moved, if you see the film, you'll understand where - toward the end! It was handled very well, and it immediately hit home the overall message.So, if you're out for some fun, it's worth a look. Paltrow is gorgeous to look at as always, and there are some genuinely funny moments and there is one plot revelation that will have you 'rolling over' in laughter!!! 'Here boy!'. Hehehe!!!Not amazing, and not awful, an above average effort - 6/10.Enjoy!",Shallow Hal

I think the whole idea of him seeing a fat girl as a skinny one is hilarious and clever. Jack Black is his usual goofy self. The way that he says things that are meant to be compliments to a thin girl, but come out sounding like a total insult since Gwyneth Paltrow is a fat girl is hilarious. Every time he saw someone who looked hot to him, even though they were totally ugly, also got a few good laughs out of me. In the end, he realizes that one doesn't have to be good-looking to be lovable, and if you keep being too picky, then you just might end up alone.

134,ayric,Offensive? Quite the Contrary,6,21 December 2001,"Dumb and Dumber. There's Something About Mary. Me, Myself & Irene. All Farrelly comedies. All hilariously funny on the border to cruelty. Shallow Hal deals with large and unattractive people. One would think that this would provide more slap-stick than ever before from the Farrelly's. Think again.This is not a typical Farrelly film. Shallow Hal has more morality and more warmth to be that. Many have complained that this film was offensive to fat people. These people must have seen this film with a mission to complain, because the film does quite the contrary. It states that inner beauty is more valuable than looks. Sure, there are times you are forced to laugh at some of the scenes, but they have been included to show that it is quite alright to laugh when funny things happen as long as you are aware of the inner qualities of people. That being said, this is not very funny. It is not meant to be either, but it is still supposed to be a comedy, and it contains too few laughs. Actually, I believe the irony of the film is that it tries too much not to be offensive. It still achieves to offend people and loses touch with the intended audience who is not easily offended. The film tries to be romantic and warm the last half and it sort of succeeds at this, but then the Farrelly's couldn't help themselves and threw in an unnecessary kissing scene with the wrong woman and also the strangest tail in film history.
All in all a valid effort, but it is too untidy.Rating: 6/10",Shallow Hal

In a way that was good as I watched it without any expectation other then the fact that Gwyneth Paltrow rarely appears in awful films.  And the same applies here, Shallow Hal is enjoyable to watch, and manages to leave you thinking a bit afterwards.  I've now read some of the other user comments here on IMDb, and it seems that many people absolutely love it.  Well, I'm not one of them, I like it but that's it.  Throughout the film I wondered if this wouldn't have been a great Drama, instead of comedy.  Every time Jack Black tried to be funny I felt it was out of place.  It is not that I feel that the material was too serious to joke about, or that it would offend some people.  I just had the feeling that the film could have done so much more if it would have decided to be either Drama or Comedy (though I'm glad that they didn't make `There is something about Mary' type).  The cutting of the film also irritated me (as so often with this sort' of comedies these days), were the whole film is build up of small scenes then pasted together at the end. There is a lack of continuity between scenes, though the film as whole pulls it off.  Finally, I felt they went a bit overboard to get a point across. The women were either fantastically beautiful, or the complete opposite. What about all the average ones   6/10",Shallow Hal

137,EThompsonUMD,"""Shallow"" is about the best you could say.",2,18 December 2001,"Has success spoiled the Farrelly Brothers? So their latest effort, Shallow Hal, would unfortunately seem to suggest. In classic sellout Hollywood fashion this film presents a superficial (shallow?) air of comic audacity that masks a core of commercial timidity. It serves us the cake of fat girl and deformity jokes, but promises to keep off the weight by popping us with politically correct diet pills. Jack Black, the talented comic actor who stole High Fidelity, makes a valiant stab here at reconciling Shallow Hal's contradictions, but the more sensitive he becomes to the skin-deep nature of beauty, the more maudlin the film becomes and the more the comic center of the film shifts to his really shallow (not to mention nasty and obnoxious) friend Mauricio. Sad to say, Jason Alexander, who plays Mauricio, does not break his consistent string of unfunny performances in unfunny movies ever since Seinfeld's demise. The waggish reversal mechanism that provides the resolution of Maurice's problems with women (much more disturbed than the essentially good natured Hal's) is too embarrassing to mention and further highlights the uncomfortable collision of farce and sentiment in the film. Gwyneth Paltrow, on the other hand, does an admirable job of making Rosemary, Hal's hefty heartthrob, a credible and likable character, both in her slimmed down version as seen through Hal's mesmerized gaze and in the obese, `real' version she bravely plays through weighty makeup and costuming.
In short, Shallow Hal fails as a physical comedy (the four good bits are in the trailer) and is completely disingenuous and unconvincing as a reverse Beauty and the Beast romantic tale. About the only thing a viewer takes away from the film is a reaffirmation of David St. Hubbins' insight in This is Spinal Tap that the line between clever and stupid is indeed a fine one.

The script lurches seeking resolution toward the end, but Gwyneth Paltrow and Jack Black are actors who can bring to life a tripped-out plot situation and give it human substance.  For Ms. Paltrow, the acting challenge is formidable, and she brings it off with sensitivity.  She had to, or no movie.  The movie has left this writer thinking about reality (singular) and realities (plural).  There is point-of-view, and there is what happens to a couple of chairs during restaurant scenes.  Also, the movie illustrates how powerful each individual is in interactions with other individuals.  The hero is the guy who manages self-awareness and responsibility.

I am one of Gwyneth's biggest fans and she is pretty good in this film.  I also think that Jack Black does have some charisma.  But the fact is that this film is in the Farrelly Brothers tradition.  That is to say that this film really is not funny.  I thought DUMB AND DUMBER was great, KINGPIN certainly has its moments, and ME MYSELF & IRENE made me laugh a few times.  But latter fare - THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, OUTSIDE PROVIDENCE, and SAT IT ISN'T SO - really did not hit the spot.  Sure, it may be easy to say that I was somewhat offended by the jokes in this particular outing.  Fact is, fat jokes don't necessarily offend me ... they only offend me when I've paid $10 and they are so not funny that even Jason Alexander can't make them work. Now, the reason that I had a hard time really slamming this ham in the ratings is that I thought that I could see the Farrelly brothers aiming at something here, something that they miss.  I know that this is a ""message"" comedy, but when you pick as the butt of your jokes a kind hearted, bruised person who also has a potentially fatal condition that they have almost no control over, well then you have to be better film makers than the Farrellys to make it work.  John Hughes made a similar and far, far better film called PLANES TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES about two people who need to see past each others physical conditions to see the real people inside.  Another thing that works against the film is that you can see the cast really struggle to make this thing funny, and that just adds to the pain of sitting in the audience -- you end up begging the cast not to cash the checks they got for this failure.  The film is simply not funny enough nor sweet enough to work (a teaming of Jack, Gwyneth, Jason, and self-help guru Tony Robbins simply deserves better).I suggest that you buy the soundtrack to Shallow Hal (because it's pretty good) and rent PLANES TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES instead.

This is partly because it still pokes fun at those people you should be accepting, but mostly because it has a big, big heart.I'm not a soppy person by nature, but I really loved this movie. It shone out like a gem in a sea of recent dross. I liked the fact that despite his flaws, Hal was a decent guy, and his actions in the children's hospital the final time only served to prove it.If there was one thing that did somewhat undermine its ultimate moral, it was the fact that the big gal who is the object o Hal's affections, is in fact played by stick-insect Paltrow in a fat suit. Made in America; a country where gross obesity seems to be a national pass-time, I find it impossible to believe that they couldn't find a suitable actress. Perhaps, despite the upbeat message of acceptance, the Farrely's thought that audiences couldn't stomach a genuine fat person in a the romantic lead?

Most of the audience I saw it with (it was a packed theater) sat through the entire movie without making a sound.""Shallow Hal"" reminded me a little bit of ""Dogma"" in that it had an overall sweet and thoughtful message but for some reason felt compelled to toss in poop jokes.  It was that uneven tone that was the biggest problem with the movie.

153,MikeK1987,The Beatles?,2,14 December 2010,"Now, as somebody who liked the Farelly Brothers work in the 90's, I had high hopes for this film, but instead, all I get is kicked in the groin with judgmental rhetoric, and lame stereotype jokes. I mean, I wasn't ""offended"" in the traditional sense of the word, but I was angered by this black and white universe that the Farelly's present in this film.You see Peter and Bobby, in our universe, there is a thing called ""Diversity"". It means that all types of people can be all types of things. Not every fat and ugly person is immediately charitable and nice, and not every person who looks physically attractive is a complete bore. That may be the norm in Hollywood, but not in the real world. I've known some real fatties in my day that were some of the most horrible people I've ever met. And I've actually met some very likable woman who also were physically attractive and made friends with guys who like to lift weights that weren't complete meat-heads.This film also says that if you happen to be a little overweight, like someone of Jack Black's build, that you're not allowed to have standards and that only you will be attractive to fat and ugly people. There could be attractive women out there who don't care that much about body type and actually like personality. Granted, the ""standards"" reflected by Jack Black's character's scarred psyche were totally and utterly unreasonable, it still doesn't mean that all he deserves is only the overweight and physically unattractive.Now, I really just want to talk in great length about one particular scene. The scene where Mauricio's girlfriend claims to have tickets to a ""Beatles reunion"", where, supposedly, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr reunited with Eric Clapton taking the place of John Lennon.I have 3 VERY LARGE problems with this scene. 1: Eric Clapton does not sound anything like John Lennon in terms of guitar playing or voice. Whoever even thought of proposing that idea and putting into this script obviously knows nothing about The Beatles, or music in general. It was a stupid idea, and the Farelly Brothers were stupid for even thinking of it, let alone sticking it into this horrible film.2. George Harrison died a few weeks after this movie was released. They should've cut that scene out of respect. You'd think that if some famous person that is mentioned in a film, passes away such a short time after the film is released that the filmmakers would've done something to pay their respects to the individual. Like... Cutting the scene altogether! It added nothing to the plot anyway, beside Jason Alexander's character being disturbed by his cute girlfriend's extra long toe, which he had already explained earlier in the film, rendering this scene absolutely pointless. If the Farelly brothers had any sense of respect for the Beatles (which they obviously don't seeing as how this scene is still in the film), they would've done the right thing. But unfortunately, they haven't, and we're still stuck with this horrible scene.3. Even if you are mildly disturbed by a disfigured toe, George Harrison didn't die, and George, Paul, and Ringo decided to do a project with Eric Clapton (although it would be HIGHLY unlikely, almost to the point of blasphemy, that they would've called it ""The Beatles""), you do not, under any circumstances, turn down an invite to an ""invitation-only, acoustic set"" of 3 of the Beatles and Eric Clapton! Even if you claim to not be a Clapton fan, it's still 3 of the Beatles! Mauricio was an idiot!As for the actors themselves, Jack Black and Jason Alexander are both very good in their roles, as 2 slimy but likable characters. Gwyneth Palrow was miscast, I think. She's an attractive woman, don't get me wrong there, but I think that Rosemary, as Hal saw her under his hypnotism, should've been played by somebody who looked more attractive than anybody else in the film, which would've at least provided a valid excuse why Hal pursued Rosemary, as opposed to other women, who honestly (under their hypnotic appearances, of course) seemed to me to be more attractive both physically and emotionally. Paltrow just seems more like the Girl Next Door kind of beauty, as opposed to the ""supermodel"" archetype, which is what I think the filmmaker's were going for with the character, as she appeared to Hal's hypnosis.Anyway, to sum up, nowhere near as good as any of the Farelly's 90's movies. Represents unrealistic and hurtful stereotypes about certain types of people. A scene which spits in the face of the Beatles.

How clearly would it demonstrate we mostly judge people based on their looks, clothing, make-up and style. Unfortunately Hollywood has managed to use this premise and ruin it in Shallow Hal. It may seem to be a filmed version of exactly that experiment, yet is isn't once you think about it. It's not our shallow lead character only sees Rosemary's inner beauty, he is mind-tricked into seeing inner beauty translated into a hot and sexy package. So after all he is not wooing Gwynneth Paltrow because of her great personality, he is still chasing his usual hare, today's ideal in looks, who also happens to be a nice person. Duhh! THINK! In fact, this movie boils down to shallow jokes about fat people, like huge knickers and such, where the source of many of the corny jokes lies in the fact the audience know how fat his dream girl really is, a fact which he is oblivious to. And of course, in the end, when he 'wakes up' he cannot but conclude Rosemary is still who he wants to be with. So, lucky nice and fat people, there is hope after all. All you have to hope for is a blind or hypnotised goof ball who cannot see you are fat, and then, maybe you'll get lucky if this period lasts long enough. Be honest, would you have liked Rosemary (kind of a boring goodie two shoes gal if you ask me) if you had to constantly watch let's say Roseanne Arnold (Barr) play that exact same character? It amazes me how many people apparently don't see the hypocrisy in this flick and don't even feel their intelligence is abused here. Besides this stupidity the film just isn't funny, it hardly made me laugh. In a nutshell: trash it. Waste of your time and intelligence. 2/10",Shallow Hal

158,forecastmazy,Cute Message but.....what?,5,2 June 2003,"The movie itself had a very cute message. Its a very nice message, not being shallow is something I'd like the entire culture to achieve. In America. Where Hollywood is. Yeah that's really going to happen soon...
So maybe our culture is very shallow. I mean it's only getting worse with the sad obsession with BAD reality-TV our country has. Yes, being shallow is getting to be quite a problem....or is it the same problem with more technology? And are the non-shallowists just too concerned with the other half of the world? Hasn't always been split this way? Um ya, but the movie has a nice message... Unfortunately the movie's message overtakes the entire plotline. The movie becomes less amusing and more depressing in a creepy kind of way. The main character falls in love with a really cute girl, Gwenyth Palthrow, but then finds out she really wasn't the same girl. The truth is he learns he has self-confidence once creepy Tony Robbins touches him on the head. After that he pursues hot women who are less conceded because they are really fat. So the movie conveys a very good message and it is indeed very cute. It jabs basically at everyone's instinct and then does a good cute at your ego with a scene where the little kid Jack Black hung out with turns out to be a burn victim. Truth be told, the movie isn't really that funny. It's like if you put Jack Black in 'Pay It Forward'. Mix together the depression of 'Pay It Forward' with the comedy of Jack Black and you have an oddity of a movie..your pretty sure your supposed to laugh but you'll mostly just be disturbed. So in between Jack Black's stoner humor and insane antics and a extremely moral and yet depressing movie you need humor...where's the balance? Jason Alexander, who is the only REALLY funny part of the movie and delivers most of the laughs. The Farrelly brothers prove they can be very sad as well as very funny. So maybe this balances out the rauncyness of 'Theres something About Mary'. Maybe they felt they had to balance that out. I don't know. But the movie gets a six from me, if for anything just for the part with the wagging tale which stays true to Farrelly's common motif of human oddities. The movie is worth watching but you won't want to watch it again. I like it when the Farrelly Brothers make me happy but I guess they can make me kinda-sad too. The movie is worth watching but gets six stars. Cute and twisted but not what I wanted from the Brothers 'F'.",Shallow Hal

All in all, a clever take on an everyday topic that I'm sure blokes all across the country talk about on a daily basis.

His friend Mauricio (Jason Alexander) is always with him at bars and they both try to make their moves on women, but always come up very short. When Hal gets stuck in the elevator with a famous guru (Tony Robbins) the guru hypnotizes him so that from now on Hal will see only the inner beauty of the women he looks at, not the outer. Jack Black and Jason Alexander are very funny throughout the movie and their are a lot of good fat jokes. Paltrow does great in her performance as the inner beauty of Hal's 300 pound girlfriend, Rosemarie, and the film teaches a good lesson that everybody should know.

The plot moved along, not too draggy, but not too smartly either.There were touching (albeit predictable) moments, especially when Hal returns to the hospital where Rosemary worked after he was jolted back to ""reality"". However, these were few and far between.My real problem was with Jason Alexander. From almost the beginning until well after the credits, I found his character inane, reprehensible and boorish.

His dad gives him valuable words of wisdom about how there is nothing more important in life than getting a little tail.Fast forward several years and Hal (Jack Black) is shallow as ever with women. All he and his friend Mauricio (Jason Alexander) care about are a woman's physical appearance, that is until one day when he gets trapped in an elevator with Tony Robbins, who unleashes the demons that dominate his opinion of women, making it so he only sees what women are like on the inside, rather than their physical appearances only.Things take an interesting turn when he meets Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow) a woman who looks perfect to him, but obese to the rest of the world.Jack Black was a great choice for this material. He doesn't top his performance in High Fidelity as music junkie Barry, but his facial expressions and tone of voice make him perfect for the character of Hal. Jason Alexander plays the bizarre Mauricio, complete with spray-on hair and something that I think all of us are glad we don't have. And of course we get the usual assortment of Farrelly brother outcasts, this time a guy with uncontrollable dandruff, a top-heavy midget who walks on all fours, and some truly heinous women.This is usual Farrelly brother fare (though not as ""gross-out"" as Dumb And Dumber), but what makes Shallow Hal different is the heart it has.

167,Scottie-3,"Sweet, but short on laughs",4,9 November 2001,"This unusual entry in the Farrelly brothers canon is long on compassion but short on laughs. Unfortunately, the lack of comedy is due not to a lack of trying but to a large percentage of jokes falling absolutely flat. The Farrellys have often relied on comedy that ridicules the disabled and the unattractive. We laugh, if uncomfortably, at these jokes in their other films. ""Shallow Hal"" tries to amend this, displaying a great deal of compassion for those who are different, but revealing that without the freak jokes, the Farrellys just aren't very funny. Gwyneth Paltrow is very good as the 300-lb. Rosemary, whom Hal sees as thin and beautiful via a hypnotic suggestion from Tony Robbins. In her thin state, we see how every fat comment wounds her. Her eyes are particularly expressive when Hal compliments her on her beauty. We see a mix of wonder, suspicion, hurt, and hope--all in one expression.",Shallow Hal

A cute premise, except when you realize MOST people would look different under this rule.  In the movie, fat or hideous becomes attractive, and one slimy gold-digging girl becomes ugly.  This is a terrible simplification of the idea...Especially annoying was that the only fat people in this movie are beautiful to Hal.  I would agree, they are probably more attractive on the ""inside"", but a lot of overweight people I've known are particularly neurotic, lack ambition, have terrible self-esteem, or have an attitude that looks don't matter at all, and for those reasons I haven't really wanted to get involved with any of them.  But don't get me wrong, it's not like I think your average attractive person is much more together.  But when you start thinking about this, the whole movie falls apart.  The worst of all: how come Hal never sees himself as ugly?  He's basically a horrible person.. Oh, and if you think there's more to this movie than the premise, you're wrong.  There isn't.

For those who expect a film like ""There's Something About Mary"" or ""Dumb and Dumber"" (two other Farrelly brother comedies) may be disappointing, which was the case of me. I was hoping to come out of the theater with a sore throat, such as when I saw ""Rat Race."" But that was not the case with ""Shallow Hal.""

177,johnprestonevans,A Deep Comedy,6,30 December 2001,"Jack Black's abrasive off-the-cuff persona is perfect as the skin deep womanizing leading man in this strangely billed ""comedy"".  He starts out as a night club reject, intent on attracting only the most attractive out-of-his-reach women.  A chance meeting with self help guru Tony Robbins sparks a hypnotic transformation in Shallow Hal, who learns to see the inner beauty in people - thus altering his physical perception of them as well. Along comes the sweet, shy and pretty Gweneth Paltrow of whom Hal falls madly in love with.  The gags of this film are fairly basic. While the rest of the world sees Gweneth's character as an overweight person, Hal is blinded by his hypnosis and sees her as thin and attractive.  Both Paltrow and Black play their parts with sincerity and sensitivity.  There are numerous gags in the film which are not very sensitive, and poke fun at the comical mishaps of an obese woman.  While the jokes are fairly funny, they are somewhat embarasing to watch, and the real tone of this film becomes clear.  You may find yourself laughing that some of the mishaps, but begin to feel increasingly guilty for doing so.  When Hal finally snaps out of his hypnotic state and sees Paltrow's character as she really is, his knee-jerk reaction is to run the other way.  The movie really centers on how shallow, judgmental and insensitive our society is.  Its a moral fable that not only says beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but also that it's deeper than skin deep.  Shallow Hal is more of a social commentary with a good message than a knee-slapping care-not comedy.  Final Rating = 6.4/10",Shallow Hal
178,bdeyes81,"The 2nd Best Love Story of 2001 (No, I'm not kidding!)",10,11 November 2001,"I have to say that no one is more shocked than me about my reaction to ""Shallow Hal"". I'm definitely a fan of The Farrely Brothers, having enjoyed all of their films on different levels. Like most fans, my favorite film was obviously ""There's Something About Mary"", and I always cited that film's romantic plot as the true enduring factor in its appeal. Sure, it was one of the funniest movies of all time, but we all have our own love story about some one from our past who we could never get over, and it was central to the film's humor and fundamental sweetness.If ""There's Something About Mary"" was sweet, then ""Shallow Hal"" is simply beautiful. ""Beautiful"" might seem like a strong word to use when describing a film from Peter and Bobby Farrely...God knows I'm the first person to admit that. But in truth, all of their films have been slightly romantic, from ""Dumb and Dumber"" right through ""Me, Myself, and Irene"". And while ""Shallow Hal"" is certainly a comedy, I'd go so far as to say it's the best indication thus far that The Farrelys might just have a future outside of the comedy genre.The plot of the film is unnecessary, because it is given away in the trailer. And like another viewer mentioned, most of the laughs are given away too. However, it's not any big loss. The film has some big laughs, but it is really not as funny as I might have expected, and in all honesty it's probably the least amusing of the duo's films thus far. But here, the comedy is actually secondary...there are several long stretches where the film goes on with hardly an attempt to make the audience smile, let alone laugh. It really is THAT interested in the budding romance between the Hal and Rosemary.The theatrical trailer to this film has gotten a decided mixed response from audiences, prompting me to wonder if perhaps audiences are returning to their PC ways these days. A lot of people have expressed offense at the notion that a male hero can only find love with a woman if he views her as being a thin, blonde sex symbol. However, the trailer is wholly misleading. A lot of people may chuckle at the seriousness which I apply to the film, but it deserves to be taken seriously. With ""Shallow Hal"", the Farrelys are exploring The American Male at its most, well, shallow. This is embodied through the characters of Hal and Mauricio, who are on the endless prowl for an aesthetically perfect female. For Hal, romantic feelings can only be understood through physical attraction...any spiritual or emotional fulfillment is completely foreign to him. The progression of the storyline challenges him to grasp that beauty and attraction without needing to see it in front of his eyes, but rather feeling it through his heart and soul.
I know all of this sounds cheesy, and in truth, it is! But that's because ""Shallow Hal"" is, at its core, merely a good old fashioned love story...and an exceptionally beautiful one, I might add! This is largely thanks to a luminescent performance from Gwyneth Paltrow, who captures the role of Rosemary perfectly. Paltrow is a beautiful young woman, but its not her physical attractiveness that contributes to her characterization...in fact, she glows as much wearing a latex ""fat suit"" as she does in a mini skirt! She's simply wonderful in the film, and I would go so far as to call it one of her best performances. I cannot say that I was familiar with Jack Black prior to seeing the film, but he did a solid job with the title role. He's not quite Ben Stiller, but he was ideal for the role, a mass of vulnerability and naiveté glazed over by a bravado of not-so-assured confidence.However, the true stars of this film are Peter and Bobby Farrely. They have crafted a wonderfully enchanting modern fable, and given it just the right dose of humor to keep it from ever being preachy or offputting. Had this been done straight, it could have played like an afterschool special about body image and insecurity and purely intellectual love. In the hands of two comedic geniuses, it's a piece of cinema magic.I cannot say that ""Shallow Hal"" is a better love story than ""Moulin Rouge"", but it's a damn close second. Although few people will admit to being as superficial as the lead character, many audience members actually are, and I am confident that a lot of people will come away from this movie with a new understanding for beauty and true love. You might not expect a whole lot from The Farrely Brothers by way of emotion and sentiment...but after this movie, I think everyone will.My Grade: A-(It's worth noting that some critics who found the plot troubling were nonetheless quick to point out the relative unattractiveness of the leading male characters..a glaring example of hypocrisy",Shallow Hal

Like he loved her *despite* her being 350 lbs. If someone is gonna love me, then they're gonna love all 378 lbs. of me; there won't be anything to ""look past"". Another thing that proves my point is that they used Gwyneth Paltrow for one of the main roles. Now WHY didn't they use a *real* big woman like Kathy Bates (Fried Green Tomatoes) or Kathy Kinney (Drew Carey Show)? They used Gwyneth Paltrow in a ""fat suit"", which further makes me believe that they think fat women can't be beautiful or they would have used someone who was really big in order to make their point. Now, I thought that the way they showed what torment a lot of us big women go through everyday with the stares, comments....etc. was good, but they also countered that ""good"" act with making her eat like a pig and having her chair collapse, which also is a slap in the face to many big people, because not all of us eat too much (I'm a vegan, as well), some of us are big because of medical problems (like myself) and not all of us have had a chair collapse; I haven't. The way that she got made fun of brought back many memories for me being an overweight teen and I think that they could have done a LOT of good with this movie had they actually gotten input from big people and then tried to expose the stereotyping of big people.

What is unusual is to have a movie that talk about this problem in a humorous way. I do not think fat people are perceived in a negative way on the contrary the movie makes them into stars. It may change the perception of fat people on the US. Overall it appears more like a movie that tries to show that we are all human regardless of our physical problems. Whether one is fat, a dwarf, disfigured or else we are still human with emotions and feeling. That is the nice part of the movie. Basically it is about accepting the other even if he/she is not a Hollywood stereotype. It is a difficult topic to address and to present in a movie and I think that presenting it with humour was probably the only way to go. Otherwise it would have been to depressing for all of us. So these are the good points of the movie.Unfortunately, the movie was badly filmed. Indeed, too often did I see the microphone above the head of the main character.

Jason Alexander has the funniest bit towards the end, when his character reveals a certain ""physical trait"" he has kept secret to Black's character for who knows how long.  To change the subject, I don't think many fat women would be offended by Paltrow's overweight persona, for the fat girl cliches are so over-the-top they are hilarious, and Paltrow plays her character as a smart individual.  I'm sure, though, that people will find other things offensive, most likely the character of ""Walt"" (even though he's played as smart and positive).

It's smart in it's plot and premise, and it's challenging in it's characters. But while their movies seem to move positively in one direction, in story and maturity, it seems to move downhill in being funnier than their last efforts.  And the movie sacrifices plenty of big laugh out scenes for a really smart story, and supplies just enough laughter without over doing it, unlike EARlier works (Dumb and Dumber - which seemed it's only purpose was to make you laugh).Shallow Hal moves to makin' you care about the characters.  When furniture breaks under Gwenyth, it wasn't meant to offend as many people are taking it, but as a challenge to those who often would find that funny, and with hopes to make them empathize with the character instead.  The fact that people think the Farrellys meant to be offensive because of their past movies drives the point home even more clEARly... because like there movies, shallow audiences need to mature with them.",Shallow Hal

If I hadn't known that this film was a Farrelly Brothers picture, I wouldn't have pegged it as such.  The crude humor is missing, there is very little innuendo, it doesn't offend on a harsh level by making fun of disabilities, and it carries a very clear moral message.  (A message?  In a Farrelly film?!?)  Gwyneth Paltrow gives one of her best performances in this role. Watch as she walks like she is heavier than she really is, and we get a sense of low self-esteem from her character that we have never seen quite like this from her acting.  Jack Black is also very good; I've always loved how laid-back his acting is.  And you can't miss Jason Alexander as a self-centered jerk with a . . . . watch the movie, you'll see.

In it's own way, this movie is a classic, almost like a reverse Cyrano de Bergerac.  The Farelly Brothers have a reputation for over the top gross out humor and there certainly were plenty of opportunities for it here, but they took the high road and the result, in my opinion, is really worth watching and thinking about.",Shallow Hal
193,haniff,Fantastic Film,8,27 January 2002,"The Farrelly brothers are quite unique, bringing toilet humour to the mainstream movies. It works because we all secretly do laugh at toilet humour on a subconcious level, the problem is the jokes are simplistic.But, humans are not, and I don't think any person is going to go all the way and say these are Geniuses.  People aren't gonna boast about the depth and meaning of their previous films, even boast about owning them. But you've got to admit some scence in previous movies are literally side splitting, but a few scenes don't make a meaningful movie.I'm not quite sure where they are coming from, but *reading between the lines* there is a very important moral in this film.It has many faults, and very difficult to talk about, most people will reject it, and pick it faults, which it has many.I can list them, put they are so obvious what's the point?Put it this way, I read between the lines, and got what they were trying to say, people shouldn't be based on their looks. We live in a world that in ever increasing in this kind of bad attitude.Unfortunately we do live in a shallow world, and anything that make people think about disabled, obese or burn victims in a better way has to be a good thing. This film believe me if it makes one shallow person 1% less shallow, and if it makes the world a better place by a tiny billionth of a fraction it's worth it.I got it, looked over it's crassness and got the message. I hope you do. But it's nowhere near the toiler humour of the previous movies, infact perhaps they heading in a new direction here in this movie.(99.99999% of people won't trust me won't on that one...)Anything that brings almost a tear to a grown man, has got to get 10/10 no matter how shallow people are and put it down.",Shallow Hal
194,Aysen08,"~ ""Tons"" of Fun ~",9,6 January 2005,"Probably my favorite of Jack Black's movies to date. Taking on the phrase ""beauty is only skin deep"" with heart.Hal is a guy who due to his father's last words under drugs, seeks out women with great outsides, who are typically out of his league. Upon meeting Tony Robinson, the self help guru, he gets hypnotized & Hal suddenly starts seeing women's inner beauty reflected on their outer appearance and believes himself to be irresistible to women.It's through these rose colored beer goggles Hal meets Rosie, a 400 lb woman with a heart of gold, and falls head over heels for her, not realizing she's largely obese in reality. Hal finally learns what it's like to fall in love with a woman's soul, but just before happiness is reached his reality is called back in by Mauricio, his shallow best friend who takes off the hypnotism out of selfishness. It's up to Hal to decide whether to look past Rosie's outer appearance & be happy, or to go back to his old life lonely bachelorhood.This movie manages to tackle the issue with terrific humor, most of which comes from Hal's ""shallow"" friend played by Jason Alexander (I can't stand this guy, but he was actually able to put his being a jerk to good use here and pull it off well). Cankles? An overall feel good movie, laugh, learn, & love it. 9/10 is what I give it.",Shallow Hal
195,samzzz-69448,"The Farrelly brothers' sweetest rom com, but could have been even better",7,6 August 2017,"This is a surprisingly solid little romantic comedy with a simple message that manages to convey a sense of sweetness that lingers on even after the film hits the end credits.The film has a very basic premise: what if beauty REALLY isn't skin deep? With this central question comes several others: What if one's appearance is the direct reflection of one's 'inner beauty', and what if somebody suddenly begins to see the world and everyone in it in exactly this way? It sounds like the recipe for a dramatic, thought-provoking, award- winning tear-jerker, but having suffered from the viewing trauma wrought by last year' Collateral Beauty (marketed to be just such a thing), I'm not so sure. What we got is a Farrelly brothers project starring 1st-time-leading-man Jack Black, and so it should only be judged for what it is, a mainstream studio film and a PG13 romantic comedy.Such a subject matter could have easily fallen prey to a much more vulgar brand of humor , so it's refreshing to see the offensive fat jokes and cuss words kept under control here. The dialog is a little lacking in terms of memorable highlights but is otherwise fine. The film doesn't rely on cheap and abundant uses of slapstick action that has no consequence whatsoever to either the plot or the continuity within the scenes, or on visually striking wacky sidekicks to create humor (I'm thinking about you, Mr. Sandler). The 'ugly' versions of people are striking when they appear, yes, but they are not subjected to mocking or outright bullying like, well, Adam Sandler movies tended to do.Jack Black does a nice job portraying a 'shallow' guy who undergoes an internal transformation within the main storyline, bringing his character arc to a fulfilling end. However I have wondered how prime Jim Carrey would have fared as Hal, but prime Carrey probably would command a more dominant role as THE central and therefore only truly meaningful character, and that wouldn't do since it would mean stealing the show from Gwenyth Paltrow. Paltrow gives perhaps one of her sweetest performances as the utterly self-conscious, grossly obese Rosemary, the highlight of the film for me. She manages to bring out the innocence and fragility of a down to earth (very obese) young woman who seems to know and accept the fact that she's never going to be associated with ideas such as beauty, attractive, etc, even when she's in her own slim and frankly smoking hot version. I have watched Adam Sandler's 2002 film Mr. Deeds prior to writing this review, and Winona Ryder's character in that film, in both her 'Virgin Mary' act as well as the 'I'm changed' good woman version, lacks depth when compared with Paltrow's Rosemary.The direction overall seems spot on for the leads, and the selection of the soundtrack contribute to the overall feel of the film - lighthearted, a little silly, but sweet and even a little moving at times. Jack Black dances a lot, slim Gwenyth falls a lot, and fat Gwenyth hurts a lot, but it's the scene of the burn victim girl that stands out as a very touching human moment.However, one may argue that the film's male gaze is sometimes too obvious for the wrong reasons. Paltrow goes semi-nude on several occasions and I'm not sure how these are supposed to work with the dating couples in the audiences. The films settling with fat=ugly 99% of the time also needed some polishing. Jill's character feels like wasted potential. She's the only 'pretty' pretty woman in the story, she witnesses Hal's transformation first hand, but she's reduced to a cheap plot device at the end of Act 2 as the 'coincidence' that Rosemary stumbles into. Since its revealed that Jill's actually a nice person because she disliked the original, 'shallow' Hal, then surely we could do without the 'let's go to my bed tonight' seduction just to somehow contrast her with the saint like Rosemary. I feel that Jill' character should be better developed and more involved with the main storyline. I even think that a scene showing Jill and Rosemary meeting and talking about Hal could be great.I can see why the film has middling reviews from both critics and the general viewing public. Even after a slow start, the story drags on at times, the humor isn't that funny, and the dialog is average. I first watched this film back in 05, with Chinese subtitles, when I was a high schooler in Beijing. More than a decade later, as an exec in the film industry, I gave this another try and am pleasantly surprised to find that it still moved me at several places. It could be the universality of its subject matter. Not many American comedies can to more than merely entertain the international audience, but this one pulled it off. Hence my rating, a very solid 7.",Shallow Hal
196,christmas_28,A Real Beauty,10,10 November 2001,"SHALLOW HAL (2001) **** (out of ****) The Farrelly Brothers have been known for making offensive films full of gross-out sight gags and filthy humor.  But my perception of the filmmaking duo has been forever altered with the release of ""Shallow Hal,"" the sweetest and most endearing picture of the year. Meet Hal Larson (Jack Black).  He's an average Joe with less-than-average looks, yet he believes himself to be God's gift to the female race.  Taking a step back, Hal's father, while dying, gave nine-year-old Hal the advice that all life is about is sleeping with gorgeous women.  So Hal, along with his best friend Mauricio (Jason Alexander), prowls about the nightclub circuit in search of sexy ladies. However, a freak accident leaves Hal trapped in an elevator for several hours with self-help guru Tony Robbins (playing himself).  Robbins proceeds to place a sort of spell on Hal so that he can only see the inner beauty of people. Later, Hal meets the kindhearted Rosemary Shanahan (Gwyneth Paltrow), a Peace Corps worker currently volunteering at a local hospital.  Hal is enamored with her, for he sees a stunningly beautiful woman.  However, everyone else only sees Rosemary's obesity. Soon, Hal finds himself head over heels in love with Rosemary.  But when the spell upon Hal is broken, he must decide whether or not he still loves Rosemary, despite appearances. The Farrelly Brothers have finally struck gold with this gem of a film. Granted, there are a few seemingly obligatory fat jokes scattered throughout, this being the Brothers' trademark.  However, what these two men have crafted is one of the most beautiful and touching films in a long time. How many films nowadays actually have a message to teach?  ""Shallow Hal"" teaches an obvious and amazing message of not being concerned with external appearances; it's what's on the inside that counts. The film has got an overwhelming sweetness and an underlying yet sublime sadness to it.  It makes everyone in the audience think twice about their own shallowness.   The two leading performances are outstanding.  The ever-brilliant Gwyneth Paltrow delivers one of the year's best performances as the 300-pound Rosemary.  She brings a quality to her character that is exuberant yet wistful.  Paltrow's emotional range is superb, and the character becomes not someone we feel sorry for, but someone we applaud.  Jack Black is wonderful as the title character.  Funny, believable, and ultimately moving, Black's performance is top-notch. ""Shallow Hal"" is a small film with a big message, and the Farrelly Brothers orchestrate it to perfection.  After leaving the theater, it took me a while to get my emotions under control.  This film is a heartwarming experience that should be shared by all and missed by none. Backed up by the terrific performances, ""Shallow Hal"" turns out to be one of 2001's best films.",Shallow Hal

Mainly because of the few people I talked to about this film said it wasn't all that good, or the ""typical"" romance-comedy. Plus, having a 6.1 overall rating here at IMDb didn't help.  Well, after watching the movie, I was shocked. It was by far the typical teen comedy about romance. Jack Black, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Jason Alexander do a fantastic job.

201,marcfemenella,What is the message?,5,11 July 2002,"After seeing this film I left it feeling pretty entertained and relatively satisfied. Although far from liking it as much as Dumb and Dumber (the best Farrelly Bros. movie to date), it was basically a formulaic romantic comedy with a slight twist.But in pondering its message I realized it had none.  I mean, this movie's goal was obviously to say SOMETHING, but it didn't really say it or know that that something was.  Going into the movie WE know the message that beauty is what inside just HAL doesn't.  SO, what are we to learn?? NOTHING. We know the story and the message way before the movie starts and it never sways from that or shows us anything new and original.  Is it saying this could happen in real life? Or should it? No, because we know that isn't true.  Unless the events unfold just like this, this would never happen in real life.  Oh I see, if you get hypnotized and tricked into falling in love with a fat person then you should go off with them into the sunset.  OK, I'll keep that in mind for the future.Beside there being no clear message, the cheesy, badly acted lines from Tony Robbins are just TERRIBLE. Why do they show this guy as a rich celebrity in the movie? With a limousine and nice suits? Does that make him SHALLOW (an overused word in this movie, which is never clearly defined)??  The few ""Farrelly-type"" things with the fat jokes, *SPOILER*-the tail, and the ugly people just don't fit in with the rest of the movie.  Also, we cannot really escape the reality of who is playing this girl--Gwyneth, the queen of shallow (although she does a decent job).  Essentially, we know that none of these actors buy into this and it shows.But these things aren't really apparent while watching this movie because it is as light as cotton candy and about as deep and emotional as an episode of ""Full House"". Jack Black entertains us occasionally with his (seemingly) improvised stuff and his ability to insult in a kind-hearted way.Beyond all this I would have to say my main problem with this movie is the lack of any direction.  There is nothing really interesting in the way this movie was filmed, all of it is just flat and drives the plot (how thin it is).  And I think I'm going to scream if I see another movie that uses time-lapsed sun rising/setting transition shots.  Is this what the directors think of as artistic flair? At least past Farrelly Bros. movies (although none of them great FILMS) had the story and the shock-power (with graphic visuals) to keep us thinking that what we were seeing was fresh.Even though it passes the time fairly well, ""Shallow Hal"" is about as shallow a movie can get.",Shallow Hal
202,jnkline,Quite Surprised,8,5 July 2002,"I couldn't help but laugh when I first saw the trailer for this movie. However, as the release date approached and the trailer was aired more frequently, I began to form the impression that the movie's humor came at the expense of others (ie, the obese), something I did not want to endorse. This misrepresentation was quite common.  Those who went to see the movie were hoping for the no-holds-bared type humor of There's Something About Mary, but instead got something with a subtle, but profound message. Because of this, the people who would have appreciated the film stayed home and are unlikely to rent it, and the people who did buy the tickets or rented the film are going to get something other than they expect.  The humor was solid, although sometimes infrequent.  I was touched by the humanity of the story and impressed with its tough, ethical questions.

The question is will he still love her if and when he find's out she isn't `perfect'?Jack Black (Hal) did a good job as the main character.  He wasn't this totally crazy guy that he is usually type cast as.  Jason Alexander (Mauricio) was the narrow-minded friend who said all kinds of offensive things, you're suppose to hate him.  Gwyneth Paltro (Rosemary) was the sweet self-conscience love interest with a heart of gold.Fat jokes were a little far fetched, but that was to be expecting.

204,okaycuckoo,Loses it halfway through,4,10 September 2006,"The set up is good: Hal is shallow, because all he desires in a woman is perfect looks. One day he gets hypnotised, so that all he can see is the inner beauty in people, bypassing their looks. He meets a grossly obese, good natured woman, sees her as a classic beauty, and falls in love with her. When he is de-hypnotised he has to come to terms with his feelings and make a choice.The prologue in the hospital should have been funnier - instead, the humour is supposed to come from the discrepancy of a minister becoming obsessed on his death bed with sex and beauty, due to morphine - and this is meant to explain the hero's attitude later in life. Much whackier please.I enjoyed the rest, till about half-way through. The gags and the pace were good, but then it lost its way. I think the rot set in with the ridiculous Irish accent of the girl's father and his misjudged dialogue. You get a perfunctory scene, where the hero succeeds at his job, and the boardroom gives him a round of applause. And the dishonesty of the story begins to nag - how is the hero going to cope with seeing the reality of his lover's body? At this point, there was also confusion about the rules of the hypnosis - the hero also sees the ugliness in the attractive hospital nurse? It was a jarring moment.The film gets back on track for a moment, when the hero sees a little girl in a burns unit, whom he earlier perceived as all cute and cuddly - now she is disfigured, and it strikes him how shallow it is not to react to her as he had before.The third act is really tricky - but all we get is sentimental slush. The dishonesty? His lover is grossly obese from self-indulgence, and downright unattractive. But she herself is given no impetus to change. Get on a diet! The acting was good - apart from the hypnotist guy and the two hawaiians. And is it just me, but were a couple of the ""ugly"" girls actually quite attractive?",Shallow Hal

He ultimately falls in love with a woman, portrayed by Gwyneth Paltrow, who is morbidly obese but whom he sees as being thin and beautiful.  This leads to some rather confusing situations.  One of the most entertaining parts of the movie is watching Gwyneth Paltrow act like she believes she is physically unattractive.  She is very convincing and touching as a woman who believes that no man could ever be interested in her. Another of the best parts concerns Hal's visits to a children's ward of a local hospital.  On his first visit he is under the sway of the spell which causes him to see people only for what they are like inside.  He is utterly confused as to why these children are in a hospital.

As a woman of similar proportions to Rosemary in the film I was interested to see how the previously grossly insensitive directors would treat the subject of obesity and 'inner beauty'. I have to say having seen the film and am hopelessly divided on my feelings for it. Half of me feels they were still poking fun at fat people (furniture collapsing, big splashes in the swimming pool etc.) and yet it seems the sentiment is in fact altruistic. Hal is shallow and not particularly physically attractive but is described as having hopelessly high standards when it comes to women. He will only approach very attractive women and as a result is often knocked back.After he is hypnotised by a self-help guru he is only being to see people's inner beauty, he meets Rosemary, the overweight daughter of his boss. She is funny, intelligent and kind and Hal is soon hooked. There is much reference in this film to attractive women being unfunny and not terribly interesting. Are the directors trying to redress the balance or is that reading too much in to an essentially lighthearted comedy? Oddly as the story progresses and thus the characterisation I found that Hal became more attractive. Perhaps I was also discovering his inner beauty. Gwyneth is without a doubt utterly beautiful but my main concern was how horrid she looked in the 'fat suit' (Worse than Julia Roberts in America's Sweetheart's). Fat people are NOT uniformly unattractive or ugly just as beautiful women are not all stupid and pointless. The Campaign of Fat Acceptance were outraged by the concept of the fat suit - comparing it to 'blacking up' a white actress. I'm not convinced that this attitude promotes acceptance. I admire the Farrelly brothers for taking this subject head on and I believe the message of the film is ultimately good.

It seems like they've grown up a little bit. `Shallow Hal' is a hilarious story that has a serious meaning to it.As I expected, the movie started off with loads of humor. Hal's (Jack Black) Dad tells him that he should always aim for the highest in life, and never settle for less. This makes Hal, as it says in the title, very shallow. All he cares about are looks, and it's not working for him. One day at work, he gets stuck in an elevator with motivational speaker Anthony Robbins. He removes Hal's one-track perspective on women. He enables Hal to see the inner beauty of women.This changes everything. Hal's friend Mauricio (Jason Alexander) doesn't know what has happened to him. He witnesses Hal dancing with not-so-attractive women at a dance club, and then dating a plus-sized woman named Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow).By the end of the movie, after a turn of events, Hal realizes that he is truly in love with Rosemary. He loves her for her personality, her heart, her sense of humor. The audience witnesses a man discovering what love is all about.This movie touched me, and made me respect others a lot more than I did before. It made me look on the other side of things.

We both liked the movie but I kept having the feeling that it really wasn't funny. It seems like the Farrelly Brothers played it really safe with this one. It was a movie with tons of opportunities for laughs, but it seems that too many laughs would have been at the expense of the ""larger"" population. This however, created a movie with a little more depth which gave the movie its heart. Unfortunately, this depth can be comparative to the ""shallow"" end of a pool. I must say that I do enjoy the Farrelly Brothers, and I think Jack Black is an up and coming actor. He was awesome in 'High Fidelity' and I didn't see 'Saving Silverman' but I am sure he did well for what he had to work with. I really hope that he doesn't get type casted as a funny fat guy because I think he has lot more depth and potential than that.

There are some good intention though, but the script is weak, the characters are unrealistic and the performance is below average. I admit, the creators had some kind of concept, but the most problematic part of this movie, is that this concept is bad.It is nice to emphasize the importance of inner beauty, but such a tragic effort makes the opposite effect. Shallow jokes, silly acting and questionable ""stars"" might sell a movie, but they won't make it good. When will Hollywood realize, that the script is the key of success? Good screenplays don't need Jim Carrey, Jack Black or Will Smith. Yes, they were funny in their shows a few years ago, but please don't make films based on their unique (?) mimicry any more! It will suck.And don't let the statistics fool you either. (They fooled me though.) A terrible movie can get 6.x even without cheating. You know why? Because common people with good (or at least average) taste won't even see that film. So the rating is far-far less representative, than the usual ratings.3 out of 10. Avoid it!",Shallow Hal
215,JamBap,Take the fat with the thin,10,11 March 2002,"It seems to me that the prevalent objections (flimsy at that) by most to this movie is how offensive and hypocritical it is. Ok so it's a bit thin on consistency and not strictly politically correct, but hey that's what having a sense of humour is all about. Consider the guy with spina bifida, do you think that the Farrelly brothers made up every joke in his script?, of course not, these are probably lines he uses every day to help him keep his disability in perspective and enjoy down-to-earth relationships with others (at least I hope he does, as that is what every mature, well adjusted and truly confident person must be able to do no matter what the scale of imperfection they have, and incidentally something that those with greater disabilities have generally learned to develop much quicker in life than the often seemingly perfect paragons of beauty in society who're always checking their face in the mirror to spot the first sign of a wrinkle or whether their butt looks big in their outfit) and if not, I can't imagine he would allow those jokes to be said of him in a movie that gets worldwide distribution and not in everyday life. And from those people I think we can learn an important lesson because whether we want to accept it or not, no matter how beautiful we are, at some stage our physical attributes will decay, and the longer we prolong acceptance of this fact the longer we delay the agony of the paralysing insecurity that only grows stronger as our bodies grow weaker and is an intrinsic result of placing greater importance on aesthetic qualities. And the movie demonstrated that beautifully through the juxtaposing of Walt's genuine contentment with Mauricio's ever growing obsession with his receding hairline.What's more it is quite clear that despite the fact by default we are all more influenced by the physical than we should be, (Hal being your satirically quintessential case), he quite realistically - despite the farcical nature of the film - learned through a shocking realisation (a beautiful moment in the film), his lesson. It wasn't a moment of whimsy it really did move him deeply and triggered a period of serious self analysis which as a result changed him. An experience we would all do well to have.So while it did have it's flaws appreciate that as a whole Shallow Hal conveyed an important moral that we could all use some reminding about, so please reviewers, think before you write all those self righteous reviews about how morally bankrupt it is.Now excuse me I have to go check my hair in the mirror.",Shallow Hal

218,kaimono2001,Below average romantic comedy,2,27 October 2006,"OK, I think we all know going into this, that this is a romantic comedy. Hence, there is no real need to take much of it seriously. However, I found it hard after watching the movie to not feel disappointed and not feel a bit offended. I like the actors in the film, making it watchable, but for most this is not their best. The movie tries to make a moral statement, and fails miserably. The moral I got was: pretty women are shallow, superficial, and scheming, so be careful of them; ugly women are intelligent, but deeply insecure. The moral about men is that they are ego maniacs, and if they have money the pretty women will want them. Oh, and it takes hypnotism (or maybe the Farrelly Brothers think this movie) for men to realize this. The irony is I think the moral is to not be shallow (hence the title). However, it is shallow on so many levels.If they hadn't had so many over the top stereotypes, then I guess trying to be moralistic is fine. However, there are a bunch and then flimsy ending which really doesn't deliver much credibility. So the film comes off a bit schizophrenic to me. As someone commented, it seems the Farrelly Brothers felt uncomfortable with the subject, and tried to justify it with some sort of moralistic ending.Other disappointments were that the humor stunk, childish and just a bunch of cheap laughs, but not witty. As someone stated, Jason Alexander is basically recreating George. And shockingly, Anthony Robbins makes a guest appearance. I presume he read the script before hand. Despite being a motivational speaker, I believe he is smart enough, but yet didn't find anything wrong with it? I guess he feels PR and an extra buck will go a long way. The only good things were the cast and Paltrow's acting, but again surprised she would agree to do this movie. Unlike, movies like ""There's Something about Mary"", which some may think is offensive and full of stereotypes, they don't really try to be moralistic. Therefore, they succeeding in being funny. I would have enjoyed the movie much more,if it hadn't gone the moral route and just stuck to being a comedy(romantic or not).",Shallow Hal
219,kary_david,Certainly not shallow however this is no Bergman,6,23 January 2002,"The Farrelly Brothers latest effort, 'Shallow Hal', is a quirky film that just didn't have much bite. The films' premise was simple enough.  Jack Black plays Hal Larson who together with Jason Alexander as Mauricio Wilson, play two very sexist young men. They always judge women just on appearances. Then one fateful day Hal meets famous guru Anthony Robbins who puts some kind of spell on him where he is able to look beyond physical appearances and see womens' beauty inside. Hal's spell takes the shape of falling in love with the 300 pound Rosemary Shanahan, played by Gwyneth Paltrow. Whilst everyone else sees this hugely obese woman Hal sees Rosemary only as a figure of beauty. This conceit does provide for some of the films richest comedy. For what's its worth, my verdict on 'Shallow Hal'. Its an enjoyable enough film with an appealing message. Many people may be put off by its simmplistic style, but its entertaining and the performances are good. Most of all its heart is in the right place!",Shallow Hal

My insight on the dichotomy: There is an epidemic of obesity in America, and some people haven't come to terms with the effect of their condition on their attractiveness... in any event, I can understand an obese person getting stuck on the ""fat jokes"" and not being able to get to the core of the movie, which is one of acceptance and love.It is a subtle movie made by people not known for their subtlety. I laughed more than most in the audience, and I think my heart strings were tugged more by the same realization that affected ""Shallow Hal"" the world is a better place when you see ""inner beauty"" rather than the surface--be it for good or ill.

I, personally, do not think that being overweight is something to laugh at.  The movie writers seemed to have tried to use every fat joke they could find and it get really tiresome.In reality, the only thing funny about this movie was the plot.  Let's get a little deeper into the realities of life shall we?  What are we teaching our young people with this movie?  That fat people and fat jokes are funny. That overweight people are not really attractive unless we are talking about ""inner beauty"".

It wasn't Oscar-worthy, but it's a light-hearted romance/comedy played out by some great acting and costumes. This is the first time Jack Black made a positive impression on me (although he was fun in High Fidelity--just not a large role). Aside from his cuckoo clock impression, I thought his comedic and dramatic lines were equally enjoyable and convincing. Gwyneth is always sweet and funny and her comedic timing is right on. There are plenty of funny lines. There are also plenty of beautiful, charming actresses here. No nudity, no sex--just plain fun and warmth. And there are some touching moments with unfortunate children. I didn't find this movie offensive to overweight or less-than-appealing people. The people represented in this film are very exaggerated. These characters are also very comfortable with themselves. The message under the laughs is simple and obvious, but that's not what makes it a good film. And the ending is so touching and not entirely predictable. I watch it every time I catch it on the air.

A really self-confident man (Anthony Robbins) changes the life of Hal (Jack Black) by jolting his nervous system. After this nervous system jolting Hal is able to comprehend that beautiful thin people were living inside the fat ugly people all along, so basically he got some fat-reducing glasses. Hal becomes unfattified.Hal goes on to dance with tons of pretty thin women trapped inside ugly, bad-haired, wart-friendly, elongated-nosed, fat humans. He then meets Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow) who, being the sexiest inner woman Hal has encountered, is also the fattest. At various points in the film we can see her ""true"" form on the reflections of some surfaces and when seeing her through the eyes of humans other than Hal. She's fat, like extremely fat on the outside and at one point you can actually see her cellulite, yuk! So they fall in love and have some fat sex all the while Hal is thinking he's having some super model sex.Hal's friend Mauricio (Jason Greenspan a.k.a. Jason Alexander) is a mutant and unable to score with any senorita, so he decides to ask the really self-confident man to un-unfattify Hal.When Hal becomes un-unfattified he can't understand why there is a robust woman eating his dinner at the restaurant.Mutant friend explains to an un-unfattified Hal why he's now seeing fat monstrous people instead of adorable exquisite humans. He then has a choice to make - either forget about fat Rosemary or accept her with all her chubbiness and have some lard-filled sex with her.At the end they get back together and do as fat people does: they go to hide somewhere in Africa hoping they can mix in with the indigenous bony starving population.All in all.

I think my very favorite character was Mauricio. He was just so funny! He kept calling women by animal names, such as ""hyena"" and ""rhino"", which was just so disgusting and stereotypical that it was actually funny. I love quoting the ""that's why they call it a QUIp, not a SLOOWWp"" line. Anything that Jack Black is in is just bound to be funny!

I felt sorry for the actresses who had to play these (as) repelling outsides! Jack Black was pretty good, Jason Alexander was sort of a disaster -- just really lame.

There's only the one with Jason Alexander's coccyx which I won't give away.  The film's comedic motif was the ""embarassed angst"" that you get from Ben Stiller movies (Meet the Parents most noticeably) but without the Stiller charm that makes that style work for him.  I don't know why the Farrelys would depart from their strength.  I assume they thought we would just laugh at how ugly and fat the people were when we saw them through other people's eyes?  It wasn't all that funny guys, just a chuckle and I moved on...The movie also comitted the cardinal sin of all comedies:  ALL THE FUNNY PARTS WERE IN THE TRAILER!!  How many directors are going to make this mistake?IMHO, Jack Black has one great line in the movie:  he calls Tony Robbins ""banana hands"".

Don't get me wrong, I am a big Farrelly Brothers fan. I am not discounting this film just because of their brand of humor. Rather, I found this film to not only be misguided with very poor taste even for Farrelly standards, but I don't think it was funny or well acted.

It is not what I would call a ""chick flick,"" but definitely more of a romantic comedy than most might expect.The performances are good - Gwyneth Paltrow does a really good job of making you believe she knows how it feels to be overweight.  Jack Black, who has been absolutely hilarious in supporting roles, shows he can also act in a more straight-ahead leading role.  Jason Alexander pretty much plays a George-like charater, and gets most of the laughs in the film.I think that this film accomplished what it set out to do - unfortunately I don't think it really set out to make people laugh.  I would not say that people should avoid this movie - it is a good romantic comedy with good performances.

Yes, it shows people being shallow, callous, and sometimes mean, but it also portrays some of those same people growing, maturing, and taking on depth. The casting is great. Gwyneth Paltrow is cute and sweet, and Jack Black walks the line between comedic goofball and serious romantic very well. Sure, there's a predictable happy ending, but the most popular romance stories tend to have that in common. Romeo and Juliet isn't everyone's cup of chai, after all.

After receiving this gift, Hal begins to see inner beauty and starts a relationship with Rosemary Shannahan, an overweight, 300-pound Peace Corp volunteer. Hal's friend, Mauricio refers to Rosemary when he first sees her as a ""rhino"" which indicates that he also bases his womanising on appearance. When Mauricio dumps his girlfriend because her second toe is longer than her first toe it clearly represented that he dumps girls because he's scared of something as Hal points out. Towards the end of the movie, Mauricio ends up confessing to Hal that he has a spinal condition which therefore indicates that he makes up excuses to avoid women. In today's society, people in general tend to focus too much on the outside appearance. When a friendship develops between a male and female, the personality shines and possesses the potential to develop into an intimate relationship. But if we refuse to not give people a chance of all races and appearance then we are not giving ourselves the chance to find that one special person. Today in this superficial world, the generic definition of beautiful is ""skinny and blonde"". Although what ever other people think is beautiful people still continue to possess strong standards. I agree that you have to be attracted, but can't you be attracted by personality? The outside appearance of a person should not matter and this exact message lies underneath the meaning of Shallow Hal.",Shallow Hal
249,tlianza,Awful,2,12 November 2001,"I tried to like it... honestly.  Dumb and Dumber is one of the funniest movies of all time, and Something About Mary was great too.  Jack Black was perfect in High Fidelity.  Gweneth Paltrow is hot.  It sounded like a can't miss.It missed.  It wasn't funny at all... I tried to laugh, I really did, but they weren't even putting jokes in the movie.  The ""best parts"" (which were still only mediocre) were in the trailer.  All in all, what an awful movie. Hopefully it doesn't completely ruin what looked to be a promising career for Jack Black.Oh yes, and if you've ever been to a movie before, you've already seen this movie.  The ending was more predictable than Titanic.",Shallow Hal
250,karemor,This movie isn't as shallow as many people think.,8,24 May 2003,"After watching this movie, I thought what many others have mentioned before, that this movie is as shallow as the character Shallow Hal himself because it displays inner beauty as outer, physical slim beauty. That is, it shows an overweight, kind, humorous wonderful woman as the thin, model-like Gwyneth Paltrow and a model-like, thin, bitchy gold-digging woman as old and wrinkly, thereby making the same connection between young, slim model-like good looks and a good personality that it is trying to criticize.But then I realized that the movie doesn't make this connection, the character Hal makes it. He is hypnotized or something like that to see peoples good personalities, their ""inner beauty"", regardless of what they actually look like, and he visualizes this inner beauty as the young slim model-like good looks of Gwyneth Paltrow because he is, in fact, shallow.Personally I'm attracted to other kinds of women than slim models, so if I was hypnotized the same way I wouldn't have seen Paltrow. At least I hope I wouldn't.So what I'm saying is that this movie isn't as shallow as many people say it is. Hal is the shallow one, at least in the beginning.And to finish with a comment about the movie itself instead of its comments: this is a really good, funny and thought-provoking movie. My favorite kind of movie.",Shallow Hal
251,Solaskaze,The Farrelly Bro. deal with a topic no one else would,7,9 March 2002,"The Farrelly Brother's get credit for dealing with a topic no one else will. The movie loses is focus in parts - is it a comedy? A drama? Yet another shock-value-for-the-masses movie? - but one who is not offended immediately given the topic of the film - even before seeing it - will enjoy it. As far as making statements go, one has to wonder: how would ""Shallow Hal"" go if it was ""Shallow Halle"" - the woman is the shallow one lacking on many counts, and the target is - take your pick - George Clooney - in a fat suit? There's only so much film one can get out of this topic - the Farrelly Brother's do an OK job of extracting as much as possible.",Shallow Hal
252,pelatemichael,You Must Watch This,8,3 April 2006,"""Shallow Hal"" is an amazingly funny film, if you have not seen it yet, go out and get a copy as soon as possible. The main story is about Hal, (Jack Black) who will only date extremely attractive women, who are usually way out of his league. Early in the film, Hal has a life changing experience with Tony Robins, the self help guru who changes the way he views women by letting him see their inner beauty. To some people this might sound like a ""chick flick,"" but it is much more than just another movie your girlfriend is going to want you to watch with her. But if she does, you should probably thank her.Jack Black is by far one of the funniest people I have ever seen on film. Everything about him just seems to make me want to laugh. The way he speaks, moves, and his facial expressions alone make me go into a fit of laughter that usually ends with me wiping tears away. One of the biggest things that appealed to me is that Jack Black, unlike some actors, comes across like a regular person. This makes his acting appear a little more natural than other actors. I can go on and on about Jack Black, but enough about him, let me say something about a few of the other actors in the film and the roles they play. Maurieco(Jason Alexander), whom you probably know from his role on ""Sienfeld"" as George Castanza, is Hal's best friend. Maurieco suffers from the same affliction as Hal--shallowness. Personally, I have never cared for Seinfeld or the role Jason Alexander played on it, but to my surprise he was absolutely hilarious in the movie. His spray on hair, attitude,and tail, that is right I said tail, all make for a good chuckle here and there. Then there is Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow), the girl Hal falls for after the elevator encounter with Tony Robins. Now keep in mind that Rosemary is not the drop dead gorgeous creature that Hal sees, but is really an extremely obese woman. Paltrow comes across well as being this shy kindhearted girl whom men would usually not want to date because of her weight problem. Even though she and Jack Black is sort of an odd couple on screen, somehow the two of them make it work, and it seems believable. All the actors in the film do a wonderful job and meld well together, making for some extremely funny scenes. However,the majority of the laughs in the film are visual. The costume designers and special effects team are responsible for some of the funniest bits in the film. For example, when Rosemary seen as normal Gwyneth Paltrow and not the obese Rosemary, jumps in the pool, the splash that ensues is like a tidal wave, lifting a boy out of the water and casting him into a tree. Or when Rosemary sat in a booth at a restaurant and it collapsed at just the right moment while she and Hal are talking. This made me laugh so hard I almost wet myself. The way the makeup artist and costume designers made all these beautiful women appear horrifyingly ugly is worth mention as well. The Farelly brothers, directors of the film, have another hilarious hit on their hands with ""Shallow Hal."" So what are you waiting for, go get a copy of ""Shallow Hal"" today. One of the funniest films I have ever seen. A non stop riot from beginning to end, that might even make you think about the way you view people. Watch it with your friends, or relax with a loved one and enjoy this wacky romantic comedy.",Shallow Hal
253,phreeky,Definitely for the shallow.,4,13 December 2001,"Shallow Hal was cute, predictable and very shallow.  Jack did a great job being his very funny self, but that did not save the movie.  Less than half way through we knew the ending and were just trying to get through it.  If you never had a negative thought about yourself, then you will probably love this movie, as did most of my friends.  On the other hand, if you have any type of self doubt pass on this one.  Jack Black is one of my favorite actors, but he let me down.",Shallow Hal
254,tobylovebone,"Could've, should've been a mega-hit, but still very good",8,5 July 2002,"SHALLOW HALL is a completely entertaining, heart-warming film that deals with some very sensitive issues very well.  I think it's by far, the most mature film to date from the brothers Farrelly.  They were almost able to keep all their gross out humor in check.  Almost.Jack Black is good, but he's been a lot better in other films.  He seems to have been kept in check.  Normally Black's off the wall, but here, he's very refined.  Almost tame.  Why hire Black and not let him loose ala HIGH FIDELITY or ORANGE COUNTY?I think the main reason this film was not a major hit was Jason Alexander. The former ""SEINFELD"" star was so horrifically bad, it brought the quality level of the film down.  It appears every time he's on screen that he's trying.  And desperatly so.  I wish Alexander would show the same kind of restraint and dignity Jerry Seinfled does.  Since ""SEINFELD"" ended, Alexander has basically whored himself out to every TV show, movie or TV commercial he can get his hands on.  Was that really him on FX's ""Son of the Beach""?All in all, Paltrow, the story and the directors make SHALLOW HALL a surprisingly touching and funny film.",Shallow Hal

There were a couple of moments in the last 15 minutes of the film that had me laughing, but that was too little too late.  I would have preferred an action flick.  At least when those stories suck, there is something (the action) to keep me entertained. Maybe if they'd had some explosions in Shallow Hal...",Shallow Hal

The two of them in the same movie should have been a dream come true for me.Unfortunately they chose to do SHALLOW HAL.I have mixed feelings about the Farrelly brothers.  KINGPIN is my favorite of theirs.  Liked DUMB & DUMBER and SOMETHING ABOUT MARY (mostly 'cause of Stiller).  But since then, with ME, MYSELF & IRENE, OSMOSIS JONES, and SAY IT ISN'T SO, they've lost me.  I really think they and their brand of comedy is over.  It's just not that funny anymore.SHALLOW HAL looks like it might just be one big fat joke, and there is too much of that in the movie, but it does aim higher.  Gwyneth is great at holding the movie's emotional core together.  Jack Black didn't really get to be Jack Black in this movie, which is a real shame.  And Jason Alexander--does anyone want to see this guy outside of Seinfeld?  His scenes were painfully unfunny (I blame the script more than him, though).Too many failed jokes, too little to care about...don't waste your money on this one.  Go rent SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE or HIGH FIDELITY again.",Shallow Hal
257,j2sheck,"Occasional and mediocre humor, not the Farrellys' best work",5,14 November 2001,"Though I loved the Farrelly brothers' big earlier stuff (i.e. Dumb and Dumber, Something About Mary), they really haven't come out with anything worthy of praise (leaving out Osmosis Jones which is of a different style). Me, Myself, and Irene was just okay and Say It Isn't So was terrible.  I really wanted Shallow Hal to be good both so the Farrelly Brothers could redeem themselves in my mind, and because Shallow Hal is one of the funniest people around.  He has always played an amazingly funny sidekick.  But I was severely disappointed with Shallow Hal.  The movie itself had some semi-funny parts, but they were few and far-between.  The movie was too serious to be funny, and too stupid to be taken seriously.  And to top it off, Jack Black was not given material that was funny.  He had a part that didn't suit his comedy-style.  The actual character wasn't funny.  In all, the movie was generally entertaining, but don't expect too much from it.",Shallow Hal
258,oztun,All comedy was in the previews.,3,9 November 2001,"I watched this movie expecting a hillarious comedy.  Unfortunatley I had already seen all the good stuff in the previews.  This story dragged on and didn't make much of a drama either.  I laughed a few times but not enough to classify this as a comedy.  Luckily I got to see a free preview of this. I'd suggest saving it for cable, I'd feel ripped if I paid to see it.  By the way if your real insecure about your looks I can't imagine why you would want to watch this.",Shallow Hal
259,salskent,"If you're expecting typical Farrely Brothers, forget it...",9,13 November 2001,"I'm assuming here that you've read a number of comments already, by the time you get to this one.  I'll keep it brief. ONE: this is NOT typical Farrely Brothers stuff.  If you go in expecting another ""Dumb/Dumber,"" you'll be extremely disappointed, as obviously many were. TWO: If you like a movie that blends humor, pathos, and drama, I think you'll like, maybe even love this movie.  This movie does not exist just to make you laugh; in fact, 90 percent of the laughs come out of the characters rather than the situations, which is kind of what pathos is all about. THREE: If you like to believe a movie can succeed at making you think, laugh and - in a few places - cry..in other words, both entertain you and leave you waking up at two in the morning crying out ""What the ----?"", then this is a movie for you.  Definitely. POSITIVELY. I think this movie will even make you a little disturbed.  You'll realize that the Farrelys' were ever so slyly pointing a finger at you, and giggling.  You see, the 'fat' issue consumes both men AND women.  What struck me was not only were J.Black's and J. Alexander's characters morbidly shallow; SO WERE MOST OF THE WOMEN in the early part of the film (watch for Black's character's neighbor, and the turnaround there.)  Let's face it; not-so-handsome men may slobber over Gwynnie Paltrow; but don't rather horse-faced women ALSO go googly over Tom Cruise et.al? 'Nuff said.  This movie sets our perceptions on a kilter, DEMANDS that we think about it all ...and at the same time pays us off for our efforts with surprisingly warm humor and a big dollop of romance and even happiness.",Shallow Hal
260,lilacthief,This film made me incredibly angry.,1,14 November 2001,"I can't believe this kind of thing gets made.  I went to see it at the urging of friends who heard it was funny.  It was not.  It was awful.  I didn't know whether or not to be disgusted or offended by the story, let alone the fat jokes throughout.I will admit that the film had noble intentions--see the inner beauty in everyone and you'll live happily ever after.  Too bad it managed to insult everyone along the way by making rude generalizations like fat people eat all of the time, and break furniture on a regular basis, and beautiful people are rude and insensitive.  Not to mention the fact that all fat and/or ugly people are automatically sweet spirits (you can't assume that about anyone, really).Now, some people are going to read this review and assume that I am an offended obese person.  I am not; but if I were, that wouldn't be the point. It's very clear to see that the humor in this film is at the expense of obese people, and that was extremely uncomfortable to watch.  I found the few funny moments came out of Hal ignoring the babe across the hall and her trying to come on to him when she realizes he is no longer interested. But to listen to the audience cry 'ewwww' whenever Hal moves to kiss Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow in a fat suit) is incredibly disheartening, not funny. Especially considering she is the romantic lead.  We're supposed to sympathize with her, right?  Not cringe at her.  But who knows what the filmmakers were really thinking, because the full-house audience around me was rather vocal in their disgust, and maybe that's funny to some people. Who knows?So the Farrelly brothers had a good idea, but the execution of it is in serious want.  (There were a couple of good trailers, though, which almost helped with the sick feeling I had leaving the theatre.)",Shallow Hal

Paltrow is excellent as always in this show (after seeing it I am actually surprised she decided to do this show). Black...well he's alright, but gets annoying. The ""cuckoo"" thing wasn't even funny the first time, let alone the 3rd time he does it. Farrelly brothers are definetly capable of better, and they know it, they clearly just wanted to do a show like this once throughout their career, and here it is.

After watching it I think it has a very good message even though production was a little weak.I see messages of larger people getting upset about the jokes.  Look beyond the true cruel treatment of people and look at few characters that also get looked at down upon.  The smoker, gold digger who looked like she had the life sucked out of her and showed good-looking people can be very ugly when seen from within.  The burned girl was the most touching as it is so true. We never see the inner beauty and have a hard time getting past looks. This movie is not about how society treats these people but how we react internally.The downfall of this movie is the strongest performance was Tony Robbins. This is a downfall as so many people look at these self-help gurus as nuts. Nuts they are not - philosophers they might be.Shallow Hal is really more a reflection of our society than just one individual. If it teaches us one thing is that looks are deceiving, will it change our perception I don't think so but it could only help.",Shallow Hal

Or should that be Shallow Hell. Created around the flimsiest of structures of outer versus inner beauty, the story centres on two men perpetually on the prowl for `hot young tail'; unlucky in love Hal (Jack Black) and his equally unsuccessful best friend Mauricio, who actually has a tail. <EP> When a chance meeting with a self-help guru exorcises Hal of his superficial demons, our hero suddenly has x-ray vision and can see a woman's internal attractiveness on the outside. Cue dates with oversize girls who've buck teeth, glasses, bad hair and, the most unthinkable of all, big thighs. Strung together with cringeworthy humour as flat as Hal is shallow, even the creators lose faith in their gross-out convictions and resort to a cheap attempt at justification. With its cutesy moral ending where good triumphs over evil and our leading man sees the error of his ways and the true beauty of his beloved (Gwyneth Paltrow in a farcical fat suit), this isn't a comedy - it's more of a horror.",Shallow Hal

If you want to make a funny movie with ugly people, just do it! Do not hide them behind sex-symbols.I would like to save one character from my criticism, because he is the only one that is not hidden.

He carried the whole movie along with Gwyneth Paltrow and they both did an excellent job filling roles unlike any they have done before.  Many people will like this non traditional comedy that has a strong moral message.  If you are someone who enjoys a lighthearted meaningful story than definitely see this movie.  Don't be fooled by reviews that say it makes fun of overweight people (only) because it's message is that size doesn't and shouldn't matter. Yes, the main characters are shallow and say some awful things, but their main purpose is to represent those of us who need to change the way we view and treat other human beings.

267,pscan,Just brief remarks on a simple idea well done.,9,27 August 2002,"The film `Shallow Hal` is a well acted, well directed version of an old moral truth: beauty is more than skin deep. It is very moving because Hal comes to appreciate ""beauty"" for the first time. He thereby falls in love with Rosemary, a real person, and not a Vougue Cover. Especially heart wrenching is the scene where he sees the girl at the burn unit; for the first time he sees that she is facially  scarred...and he sees beyond the burns. They are unimportant because Cadence is not the sum of her burns; she is beautiful. Of course the great moment comes when Hal sees Rosie for the first time as she ""really is"" and says, ""You`re beautiful."" He sees inner and outward beauty combine in the entire personhood of Rosie. The actress is truly beautiful for no actress can draw on emotions and attitudes of which she has no awareness; the actress gave us ""Rosie Small"" AND ""Rosie Large"" and, ironically, offered the audience true beauty in both. In a society obsessed with the outer shell `Shallow Hal` teaches a much needed moral lesson.",Shallow Hal

I like the scene when they go out on their first date. This movie had me laughing so hard that it made my stomach hurt. I love the fact that, throughout the movie, all these weird things would happen happen to Gwyneth Paltrow's character and Jack Black's character couldn't understand what was going on. It did get some bad reviews because the press felt that the movie was making fun of overweight people. I don't think that was the case at all, but if you are a person who is sensitive about being overweight then this probably isn't a movie to see. I think that people just need to a lighten up a little and not take things so personally. I know a some overweight people who also watched the movie and thought it was really funny. Overall, I think the movie was very funny and not at all too insensitive about overweight people.",Shallow Hal
269,yrok,Why don't people get it?,9,22 March 2003,"Shallow Hal is another fantastic movie by the Farrelly Brothers.  The interesting thing to me is how many people dislike this movie because they either think it portrays fat people in a bad light, or that their method of showing inner beauty by changing external beauty is somehow itself shallow. To me, it works well.The Farrelly's are using some subtle and not-so-subtle ways of making a statement about the sickness in America towards image and appearance over substance.  If you don't believe it, look at the plethora of nearly naked teenage pop stars, the rates of eating disorders, nearly all advertising, and the reality and dating shows whose only purpose is to show who is ""hot"". We are a nation obsessed with physical beauty.If in watching this movie you aren't convicted at least a little by your own shallowness, it means that you are quite shallow indeed.9 out of 10.",Shallow Hal

The viewer understands the palpable emotional plight of the overweight through her disheartened facial expressions and reactions to Jack Black's character's facetious compliments. In the same vein, I get that we are supposed to feel like everything is evened out by the inclusion of disabled (a man with spina bifida who is 'handi-capable' and walks on all fours) and disfigured (Jason Alexander and his tail) characters. I just didn't feel like it was enough.The onus is not completely on Paltrow to be a believable fat woman. Unfortunately, the Farrelly brothers' script leaves a lot to be desired. In spite of Paltrow's emotional ploys, the movie plays out with her munching on gobs of food 24/7, breaking (sturdy; it's well established that her 300 pound frame is what busts it) furniture in two different restaurants (the stunt so nice, they did it twice!); and wearing skimpy beach clothing that is obviously meant to ick out the casual viewer as s/he is confronted by Paltrow's faux-corpulent frame. Likewise, the implication that the two leads have sex is carefully relegated to a scene where Black grins at Paltrow's giant panties, because fat people actually having sex is just gross. In addition, the movie carefully builds up Paltrow in a full-on fat suit for an hour, until there's no more cake for her to shovel into her face and she's left looking miserable and vulnerable. Good thing we got a belly laugh out of her demolishing a booth at a four-star restaurant beforehand.While Paltrow is sympathetic to her character, the script is not; instead of being a feel-good, fat-friendly flick, then, ""Shallow Hal"" persists only in justifying mean-spirited stereotypes about the overweight; in this, it's on par with pretty much anything where Eddie Murphy has donned a fat suit (Hollywood, let's just not go there anymore; Julia Roberts in ""America's Sweethearts"" was three times too many for the trope to receive any kind of legitimate consideration). That the moral of the ill-told story is espoused by Jack Black, whose lusting after hotties in the film seems hypocritical, at best, hardly helps; nor does the corollary that, while fat people have a heart of gold underneath all those layers of cake rolls, skinny people's souls are shriveled and mean. Nobody wins in this movie. The only good thing about Black's character smugly deciding to do Paltrow's a solid by taking her off the market (and presumably, to the Olive Garden, since, get it, she's fat!) is that it effectively ended the movie, in true Hollywood schmaltz that changes nothing.",Shallow Hal

IF you don't it's because you didn't get the movie at all or were deeply offended by it. Of course we all knew going in that we should expect offensive comments about ""overweight"" people but I believe this movie looks beyond all that. The point the movie was driving home was how it doesn't matter what society says or how it perceives you, but everyone is different and shouldn't all be classified by good looking people or not-so good looking people. This movie really had a good moral and lesson, YOU JUST CAN'T let the offensive jokes get to YOU, because they aren't directed at YOU. This movie is a farelly bro.'s movie and that is expected. This ""romantic-comedy"" if you will is really a disguised lesson on life and it really has brought something to my attention as a human being. I especially felt this when the child was first seen at the burn unit. I saw and felt and understood Hal, and what he realized. Where the hell do you find offense in this people?!!! Honestly now, this is a truly great movie disguised as a comedy and I believe all should see it. Judge a movie based on what it is and what you see and experience, not what you expect or want to see.

I just so happen to be a large woman and have been overweight my entire life and I didn't take offense to this film at all. I just wonder how much time it takes out of one's life to worry about what somebody is doing or saying. Just enjoy life and treat people accordingly. I accept critisism as well as encouraging words. I rated this movie 10/10.",Shallow Hal
277,leeprice2006,Great emotional film,9,7 April 2006,"It's kind of hard for me describe the type of film Shallow Hall is. I think it's supposed to be a comedy but the writers managed to create mixed emotions. I would describe the film as being a romantic comedy. The comedy is definitely there and so is the romance. Without giving to much information and including a ""Spoiler"" here's what it's all about.A man (""Hal"") only see's women for their outer beauty. After being trapped in an elevator with a man who opens Hal's eyes to see the inner beauty of women. This wouldn't be a comedy without a twist. Hal see's so much of the inner beauty that he doesn't see the ""outer beauty"" of the women he falls in love with.OK, in conclusion. This film ""Shallow Hal"" has a genius story line which is guaranteed to make you laugh...",Shallow Hal

279,efazzo,"Well made movie, however showing the same old ""true love stuff""",5,25 August 2006,"Somewhat entertaining movie with the same old ""true love"" message, dressed in a slightly different way. Highlights were Gwyneth Paltrow, moving like a fat woman as a hot chick and displaying these extremely insecure gazes.Well made movie, but i didn't like the message much.Negative point is that the movie is pretending to be non-shallow while shaving humans with a very big razor - practically, hot people are depicted as bad and non-attractive as good. I was missing some person being a stunner in both ""sights"".Thinking about Hal's position in both sights leads to another question - right before the end he didn't seem like the nicest (neither the hottest, which makes him a real oddity in the movie) person on earth, but suddenly, right before the end, miraculously and without further explanation he sees the same old' ""true light of love"". How did that suddenly come? And the same old' ""true love stuff"" - cant see it anymore.Oh yeah, and the movie shouldn't have chosen pathologic obesity as its theme just for kicks... For showing inner beauty it is just over the line show off people that are practically, sorry, eating themselves to death. Is it funny when his girl is ordering three meals instead of one? I think not!",Shallow Hal

281,arnhiga,"OK, but...",6,23 November 2001,"I saw Shallow Hal on half-price Tuesdays, and I wouldn't pay any more than that. It was an OK show, but not great. There were funny moments in the film, but the acting and plot were uneven throughout. I thought Jack Black wasn't as funny as Jason Alexander, whose depth of experience at being funny on Seinfeld really shined through. Alexander is a superb comedian, a real genius at his craft.I mentioned this film to a girl, and she, being overweight, was greatly offended by Shallow Hal. I could see her point, because it trivializes a sensitive issue, for people who have a weight problem. But given that both Hal and his sidekick are portrayed as the biggest idiots in the film, it took some of the sting away from the problem of obesity. And that's funny.",Shallow Hal
282,lauren5612,Pleasantly Surprised,10,10 November 2001,"I went into this film knowing that it could be either really great or really tasteless.  Thankfully, it was the former.  The fat jokes were plentiful, but they were so clearly over the top that they didn't seem mean-spirited. We know that her weight wouldn't produce a tsunami if she jumped into a pool; scenes like that are included in the film just so we can see Hal's reactions and confusion.  Jack Black does a great job at acting his way through Hal's shallow period and his subsequent love affair with Rosemary. Gwyneth Paltrow also acts well-- it seems like she carries herself as if she were heavier, even when she's not wearing the fat suit.  If you have seen the trailer and are worried about this film being one giant fat joke, don't be.  It's a nice romantic comedy with a twist.",Shallow Hal
283,thenish,An unexpected treat.,10,11 November 2001,"What a great movie this is.  It delivers a powerful and much needed message. It is laugh out loud funny as well as human and very touching. Jack Black has got to be the next big thing.  I love his subtle and unaffected humor.  He can be hilariously funny.  He is able to be innocent and intuitive almost simultaneously.  He is absolutely charming.  My hat's off to Gwyneth Paltrow for taking this role.  She so accurately conveyed the hurt of someone who has been so misunderstood and judged her entire life. She was brilliant.  It was good to see Jason Alexander again.  He was spot on as Marisio.  And Tony Robbins gave a perfect rendition of himself. Don't leave until after the credits are over, the Farrelly brothers do something very thoughtful and unique.  I'm sure it was deeply appreciated by the entire crew.  The movie was great fun to watch.",Shallow Hal

287,jrpalmer,Boring and unfunny,1,25 November 2001,"When a theater is dead silent during a so-called comedy, that is a bad sign. Actually, toward the end there was not dead silence; people just began to talk, plan dinner, shake their heads in disbelief, check their cell messages, get their coats ready, etc. On the screen was a poorly-written, poorly produced, amateurish waste of a film company's money and the movie goer's time. I am glad we had discount tickets. It would have been much worse paying full price for this picture. These comments have nothing to do with the premise, which is valid. But it is the lack of a creative pay-off and lack of overall quality that is troublesome. Even in the final cut, some of the actors (the two Peace Corps guys, for example) were having trouble with their lines.It mystifies me why the Boston Globe gave this such a solid review.It will take highly talented Ms. Paltrow several other really good movies to get rid of the stain of this title on her resume. How did she get involved with this project? How far this seems from Shakespeare in Love, or some of her other stellar films. ""Who let the dogs out?"" should really apply to this film getting into public theaters, not to a hackneyed one-liner in the script.",Shallow Hal
288,golfgirl93,Total waste of time,1,29 November 2001,"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  And, being a Farrelly brothers fan, I was surprised how much I hated this movie.  In fact, I would go as far to say that there is nothing remotely amusing or redeeming about this movie.The acting was horrible.  Paltrow looked like she was trying to salvage this movie but she would have been better off refusing the script.  Jack Black was disappointing.  There was nothing likable about his character or his acting.  And Jason Alexander was a disaster.  I was a huge Seinfeld fan, but after seeing Jason Alexander's complete lack of talent and comedic ability, I have lost all respect for him as an entertainer.In my opinion, there were no jokes in this movie.  Rather, it was 2 hours of sophomoric comments and scenes which were pathetic.  In all honesty, I cannot think of 1 scene, or even 1 line which was funny, or even worthy of a chuckle.Finally, this movie was an insult to the Peace Corps.  Not only were the jokes about the Peace Corps flat, but they also reflected a complete lack of understanding about the basic mission and operations of the organization.I would rather be forced to watch 1,000 hours of Martin Lawrence films than be forced to see this disaster again.",Shallow Hal
289,avarvatsis,I was expecting to be entertained but got depressed,1,2 December 2001,"I was expecting to be entertained and got depressed. I feel cheated. I also think that they treated a very sensitive social issue pretentiously and irresponsibly. The ending was the final insult. It would have been much more credible if Hal had simply been remorseful but incapable of feeling utterly in love with the superfat woman simply because of his systematic brainwashing.Also by parading so many supermodel-looking women in contrast to the superfat and ugly they only made it worse. Do you think that an ugly woman that watched the movie would have felt that there is hope for her by seeing all those beautiful women? Of course, the pretence was that the producers had to use superbeautiful women to make the point but I doubt their intentions. They simply wanted the movie more attractive to the male audiences.",Shallow Hal

Night Shyamalan. what a waste of time. it defies criticism because it's so absolutely stupid and poorly written. I hate it, i hate it, I hate it.. and what's worse, the soundtrack is the worst soundtrack of all time. I hate this movie.

I can usually enjoy all sorts of comedy films whether it be a thought provoking comedy-drama ala American Beauty or a gross-out like Something about Mary (though i stress i do prefer the former usually). The problem with this film is one of identity it tries to be clever, but just isn't, in fact most of the story is inconsistent the messages are just mixed. I mean what are the Farrelly's trying to say that beauty is only in the mind?

Not only was it deceiving, but the whole aim of the movie seems to contradict itself.

296,alan-j-hinks,Just one person's opinion,3,6 April 2012,"If a good film is one that you are not sure about your feelings of it during the watching of it, one that inspires different emotions and makes you want to think about it and talk about it to others afterwards, then this was a good film. However, based upon a whole range of other criteria which I consider to be important in a film, I found it hugely flawed. I mean, comedies are meant to be amusing and make you laugh or at least smile, are they not? Not grin your teeth in annoyance or squirm in embarrassment.If you are reading this you do not need me to recap the theme of the movie; as far as I am concerned, this is a forum to express an opinion, not give a review. As far as i can see, the movie makes a number of terrible, sweeping generalisations, so now I will respond with making one - there are a lot of very selfish, self-centred, horrible, superficial and nasty people in the world, especially in America. Jack Black spends the entire movie (does he redeem himself at the end? That is debatable) playing the part of one of the most loathsome, unamusing, inconsiderate, nasty people I have ever seen on film. Maybe his behaviour is 'normal' - if so, the world is in a sorry state, in my opinion. I do not think that he is 'shallow' - well he is, obviously, but that is a bit like criticising Hannibal Lecter for not doing his fair share of the household chores - I think that he is just hugely unpleasant.The premise of the film seems to me to be that relationships - feeling of affection for other people - are all about getting what you can out of others, that you are obliged, out of some sense of right and wrong, to be nice to physically attractive people and shun physically ugly ones. In the 'black or white' world depicted in the movie there seem to be only two types of people - the physically attractive but cruel and the physically unattractive and desperate. I do not agree that the movie infers that all people who are physically attractive are sinners and the 'ugly' are saints, but I thought that it was interesting that the filmmakers made a point of ensuring that Rosemary was not seen properly until right at the end. Presumably they did not want anyone watching the movie to think, ""Hold on - she might be overweight but she is a human being"", as that might ruin the idea that no-one would be interested in her unless they had been hypnotised. Jason Alexander's character's comments about her and the women on the dance floor would have earned him a punch on the nose from me at the very least! Gwyneth Paltrow seemed to me to give the impression that she was not at all comfortable with the message that the film was putting over, and that she wanted it to be over as soon as possible and get paid, but then maybe I was reading more into her performance than was there.This is an unpleasant film about unpleasant people doing unpleasant things - which I suppose in a strange way justifies its existence, as it makes people think about the issues involved in stereotyping, generalisations etc. his reminds me in some way of Ricky Gervais's ""The Office"" series, where he plays somebody who is squirmingly awful to watch but makes strangely compulsive viewing. Unfortunately, I do not think that Jack Black is as good an actor as Gervais - although Jason Alexander may be.",Shallow Hal

Only see this movie if you know you wont take offense. I am sick of seeing movies when the girl that the hero ends up with is a thin gorgeous woman.

I'm not a huge movie person - but, I've recently watched Shallow Hal (Just goes to show how little I'm into movies - 4 years later), and it just didn't strike me as all that good.There was so many things that were questionable. The whole movie seemed to want to make a point about inner beauty - all the while, making fun of outer beauty. Not all big women have such low self esteem. I've seen many big women who were beautiful - with equally hunky men. Just because a woman is big - or not model material, doesn't mean she's going to jump at the chance to go out with just any Tom, Dick, or Harry.And, what was with the whole tail thing? Granted - it was about the only part in the movie that made me laugh - but, what was the point? It just seemed completely out of place - and ultimately stupid. Maybe if it had been introduced earlier in the movie, and thus had a few scenarios to go along with it - it would have suited everything. But, it just didn't fit.I think the only touching part of the movie, in my opinion, was when Hal went back to the hospital, and seen Cadience for who she really was. That part of the movie darn near made me cry (Okay, I'm a sap).Furthermore - if Hal was seeing women based on their inner being - then why was the neighbor still beautiful? She was just as shallow as him, thus, wouldn't she have been hideous - based on inner being? It would have made better sense, if the roles were reversed for some of the other women. The women who wouldn't give them the time of day, earlier in the movie.Anywho, I guess that about sums it up. Just wanted to give my two cents - so there it is.",Shallow Hal
300,annagreenaway,Reinforcing stereotypes,1,5 February 2005,"I could not stop watching this film because I was desperate to know exactly how the Farrelly brothers could possibly get themselves out of the huge pit they had dug for themselves. This film claims to be challenging what is considered beautiful in our society. In one section a character expresses the moral heart of the film by saying that ""beauty is in the eye of the beholder"" and by suggesting that we are hypnotised into believing what is and is not beautiful by the media etc. Fair enough! However, all representations of inner beauty are portrayed in clichéd and predictable stereotypes of female beauty in exactly the same way you would find in any Hollywood blockbuster. Thus, the film reinforces the same notions of beauty that it claims it is trying to undermine. Also, all fat people are not nice with a ""good sense of humour"", this is as HUGE stereotype. I am fat, unpleasant and not funny.",Shallow Hal

Not everyone can deal with it, mostly the fat people themselves. Eating a third of a cake is not funny. Illness associated with fat is Not funny. Relationships destroyed because people self medicate with food is not funny. When the food takes precedence over relationships that becomes an illness. Why does Hal want to be in a relationship with a sick Gwyneth Paltrow ? The answer is simple: because it pays the bills. The entire Shanahan family was dysfunctional.
