0,TheLittleSongbird,Bland survival,5,31 August 2018,"The concept was really interesting and the trailer looked great. Have also liked Shailene Woodley and Sam Claflin in other things, she in 'The Descendants' (very heartfelt and overlooked performance) and he in 'Journey's End' (was not expecting acting as powerful as the acting he gave in that film as a complex and conflicted character).'Adrift' is certainly watchable, but the overall feeling felt after watching was underwhelmed disappointment, with both good and bad things and big in quality on both sides. There are certainly far worse films released in 2018, especially of the ones so far seen 'The First Purge' and 'Slender Man', but also much better, the aforementioned 'Journey's End' being one of them. Not terrible but really was expecting and hoping to like it so much more.Beginning with the praise, the production values are wonderful. Especially the luminous cinematography, which makes the most of the atmospheric and picturesque scenery. The music has presence yet understatement but is not intrusive or ham-handed. Nice soundtrack choices and they didn't distract.Woodley is the other main asset of 'Adrift', always engaging and with lots of emotional power as a smart and resilient character, the one most developed and that rings most true. Claflin is not quite as good but supports her sympathetically. Their chemistry has pathos, though doesn't quite simmer. Jeffrey Thomas and Elizabeth Hawthorne are good in support, as are the rest of the cast, but it's all about Woodley and Claflin and they deliver the goods. There are moments of claustrophobia and the emotion is definitely there. However, the story is lacking on the whole. The pace generally needed to be much tighter, parts don't go very far or feel aimless, some of the flashbacks feeling like padding that doesn't say as much as they could, that it dissipates some of the tension. The tension only comes in spades, partly because of the pace but also, and even more so, moments intended to be surprising being too obvious in a film that's already pretty predictable. One is mildly engrossed but not excited or completely riveted.Emotional impact is there in 'Adrift' but again it could have been more tender and subtle, it would have benefitted from more simmering chemistry between the leads and the romance being less clichéd and forced. Was expecting more than teenage soap opera level on the wrong side of cornball. The structure was also an issue, the back and forth being wildly jumpy and disjointed, making the story structurally variable in coherence. The direction excels in the visuals and the direction of Woodley and Claflin, but struggles with the momentum and control of the story.Overall, watchable but could have been better. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Adrift
1,SnoopyStyle,solid survival,6,24 August 2018,"Tami Oldham (Shailene Woodley) finds herself alone on a sailing boat broken by a devastating storm. Five months earlier in 1983, she arrives in Tahiti after finishing a tour on a sailing ship. She had left her San Diego family to travel the world. She and Richard Sharp (Sam Claflin) fall in love. They are offered an opportunity to sail an older couple's boat back to San Diego. They run into the storm and Tami struggle to survive.This movie is split between two time periods. Everything after the storm is solid man-against-nature adventure. The stuff before the storm is less compelling. The meet-cute is fun. The courtship can be a bit of an info dump. Overall, this is Shailene stretching her survivalist acting chops. The final twist is not the most dramatic although I guess it has to fit the true story. A different fictionalization could have added more intensity. It should have done more with the survival story and trimmed back on the courtship story.",Adrift
2,claudio_carvalho,A Story of Love and Survival,7,19 August 2018,"The free spirit American drifter Tami Oldham (Shailene Woodley) arrives in Tahiti and finds a job at the marina. When she meets the British sailor Richard Sharp (Sam Claflin), they immediately fall in love with each other. They stumble upon Richard´s old friends and they offer ten thousand dollars plus first class air tickets for them to sail their sailing ship to San Diego. Richard and Tami accept the offer but along their journey, there is a storm that throws Richard in the sea and wreaks the vessel. Tami rescues Richard from the water and they fight to survive while the vessel is adrift. Will they survive?""Adrift"" is a good film with a story of love and survival. Shailene Woodley and Sam Claflin show great chemistry and wonderful performances. The screenplay entwining past and present keeps the interest in the film until the very end with an unexpected plot point. The direction and the special effects are magnificent, giving the sensation that the sailing ship is crossing a storm indeed. The camera work is also impressive shooting in small spaces with perfect edition. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Vidas à Deriva"" (""Adrift Lives"")",Adrift
3,nogodnomasters,The Infinite Horizon,3,31 August 2018,"I generally hate films of people adrift. I don't care if it is ""Open Water""...thanks for the shower scene, Robert Redford, military guys, or a man with a ""tiger."" They either become shark food or they don't. So all that is left to do is to fill the story with flashbacks or someone spouting philosophy, or Robert Redford close-ups. In this case, it was pillow talk and courtship, a man pledging his undying love...and then the make-up person has to make the star look worse as the film progresses, perhaps the most thankless but important job in the production. I was bored to tears, women who sail will find it more interesting than me.",Adrift
4,kosmasp,Two can sail this ...,8,16 July 2021,".. game? Or is it just boat? You'll decide that and what works for you. The movie is up front about what this is or rather where it is heading (no pun intended). We start in the ""now"" and then we have the back and forth of what was and what is happening.The two stars are the ones that hold the tension and attention of the viewers. And if someone who is not into or likes Woodley says the movie is good ... well you've got something, haven't you? A drama that is living off its structure and the drama it creates with it ... and the powerful life confirming (?) things that happen ... well if the will to survive is something you would call that ... Really well done in so many aspects.",Adrift
5,jboothmillard,Adrift,6,6 July 2018,"Film critic Mark Kermode said some good things about this film, based on the inspiring true story, I knew from the title it would be about survival at sea, I hoped it would be worth the trip to the cinema, directed by Baltasar Kormákur (Contraband, 2 Guns). Basically set in 1983, free spirits Tami Oldham (The Fault in Our Stars' Shailene Woodley, also producing) and Richard Sharp (Sam Claflin) have a chance encounter, they form a very close friendship that quickly turns in love. Richard is a sailing enthusiast, he teaches Tami all the techniques, so she can also sail a boat, and they have many adventures at sea together. Then they are given the opportunity to embark embarked on a 6,500 km delivery journey on 44 ft yacht Hazana, sailing from Tahiti to San Diego. But Richard and Tami could not have anticipated that they would sail directly into Hurricane Raymond, the huge storm has them battling the elements, with Richard thrown overboard, and Tami knocked unconscious. When Tami wakes up, she finds herself alone and adrift at sea, with no land for miles, but she is relieved to find that Richard survived the storm. Rami takes care of Richard's injuries and keeps him alive with their many conversations, she makes the necessary repairs and puts up the sail for the wind to take them back to the mainland. Tami pinpoints the nearest location for rescue is Hilo, Hawaii, but it will be a long and perilous journey, looking after Richard, and running short on food and water. But in fact, Richard did not survive, Rami was the only survivor of the hurricane, she kept the memory of Richard alive, surviving alone on canned food and navigating for 41 days, until she was picked up by a supply ship. The real Tami Ashcraft claims that it was Richard being with her that kept her alive, and to this day she continues her love for sailing. Also starring Grace Palmer as Deb, Jeffrey Thomas as Peter, Elizabeth Hawthorne as Christine and Kael Damlamian as Smiley. Woodley and Claflin are convincing with their wonderful chemistry, it makes the fight for survival compelling, you can just about keep up with the plot as the story flashes backwards and forwards in time, to the couple getting to know each other, and stranded at sea, the twist where the spirit of the man keeping the woman alive is sweet, it works as both a heart-warming love story and an exciting journey, a worthwhile romantic drama based on a true story. Good!",Adrift
6,neil-476,Gripping,8,13 July 2018,"Young and footloose, Richard and Tami are sailing someone's yacht from Tahiti to San Diego when they fall foul of a monstrous storm. The yacht is crippled and Richard has a shattered leg and broken ribs, so survival is up to Tami.Shailene Woodley (who also co-produced) and Sam Claflin star in this two-hander which relates a true story. The story switches between survival, and flashback, showing them meeting in Tahiti, falling in love and making plans. I started off wishing the narrative was more linear - convention would dictate that the storm should start the film off - but the fragmentation is clever for a number of reasons.One of these is that the big set piece - the storm which cripples the boat - comes climactically towards the end and carries a big emotional reveal with it.
Woodley and Claflin are both good. Claflin's Richard is the more thankless part as he spends much of the film lying helpless and injured, but Woodley gets the chance to show some chops. The effects are good.I was expecting this to be OK - it's better than that.",Adrift
7,ferguson-6,"true, sweet, and salty",7,31 May 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. Ever since the ""Master of Suspense"" Alfred Hitchcock captured the intensity of being stranded at sea in LIFEBOAT (1944), there have been numerous films, with varying levels of success, taking advantage of this fear shared by many folks: ALL IS LOST (2013), LIFE OF PI (2012), OPEN WATER (2003), THE PERFECT STORM (2000), DEAD CALM (1989), and THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE (1972). While some of these feature elements of true events, it's this latest film, adapted from Tami Oldham's memoir ""Red Sky in Mourning: The True Story of Love, Loss, and Survival at Sea"", that tells the remarkable true story of Tami and her boyfriend Richard.Icelandic director Baltasar Kormakur has had a hit and miss career (EVEREST, 2 GUNS, CONTRABAND, THE SEA), and this one mostly works on many levels: romance, adventure, suspense, natural catastrophe, and survival. Beyond that, it's fantastic to look at thanks to the work of Cinematographer Robert Richardson (9 time Oscar nominee, 3 time winner: HUGO, THE AVIATOR, JFK). 
Even though Tami's remarkable saga occurred in 1983, it took all these years for the film to get made - further proof that it's a new day in Hollywood! The story of a woman isolated in nature, fighting the odds to live another day would have (and this one often has) previously been back-burnered or shifted to have yet another manly man in the lead. Not this time. Shailene Woodley plays Tami and it's her most physical role to date. The opening scene shows Tami waking up on the damaged boat in the aftermath of Hurricane Raymond. It then flashes back 5 months to her arrival in Tahiti and her initial introduction to Richard (Sam Claflin), a charming solo sailor who is nearly, but not quite, her equal in free-spiritedness. The 3 co-writers, twin brothers Aaron and Jordan Kandell (MOANA) and David Branson Smith (INGRID GOES WEST) wisely opt against a first half romance followed by second half survival tale. Instead, the bits and pieces are doled out in segments that allow us to connect with the soul-bonding without losing the intensity of the stranded at sea tale. It's a delicate balancing act that works thanks to the performance of Woodley and the camera of Richardson.For many of us, the concept of sailing from Tahiti to San Diego with someone we've known for a few months would be a bit overwhelming. But these two lovebird and adventurous spirits head off thinking of it as fun and an opportunity to fund even more fun. It's a story of the power of love and the strength of survival instincts. Rarely have a sextant, Skippy Peanut Butter and Tom Waits music combined for such vital roles in a movie, and it's nice to see Ms. Woodley gain a Producer's credit since she was a driving force in getting the film made.The 41 day ordeal is told from Tami's view (it is, after all, based on her book), and the strength of this 23 year old gets the treatment it deserves with some absolutely terrific sequences filmed at sea. Though Tami doesn't battle sharks or have Wilson the volleyball to keep her company, her coping mechanism is even more mind-bending. It may not be the light-hearted summer fare we are accustomed to, but it's one worth watching.",Adrift
8,phd_travel,More involving than similar movies,8,30 September 2018,"If you think you have seen enough of this type of movie, well this one is a good one and worth watching. A couple get caught up in a hurricane. With a badly damaged boat she manages to drift 41 days to reach Hawaii. 
Shailene Woodley gives a well rounded performance that is totally believable. She has become a mature actress in this movie. She looks weatherbeaten enough to be an authentic looking sailor. Sam Claflin plays the sailor. Clever the way they let him live on in the movie. Usually I don't like flashbacks but here it helps the movie from being monotonous. There was a similar movie with Robert Redford about a solo sailor. Adrift is more involving emotionally.Worth a watch.",Adrift
9,mm-39,Well structured story but depressing.,6,13 June 2018,"Well structured story but depressing. In the 70's the tagline for Jaws is you will never want to go back into the water after watching Adrift I feel the old tagline and will never sail. What worked: A interesting story which engages the audience. Adrift merges two stories. One story is of the past romance between the two protagonists and the second story is in the present with the dangers of being adrift. Believable acting the audience believes the characters are in love, and fears dangers of the being adrift in a huge ocean. What did not work: Adrift is made too well; Adrift is just like watching the show Survivor, which makes Adrift slow in spots. Being sun burn,ed starved, and scared was too hard to watch. A good movie, but I would not watch it again.",Adrift
10,Hellmant,"The survival scenes are well done, and Woodley makes a great reluctant action heroine.",7,1 June 2018,"'ADRIFT': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A survival drama based on the true story of a couple that got stranded in the Pacific Ocean, and then had to find their way home to Hawaii without any help or navigational tools. It stars Shailene Woodley and Sam Claflin, and it's based on the book 'Red Sky at Mourning: A True Story of Love, Loss, and Survival at Sea' (by Tami Oldham Ashcraft and Susea McGearhart). The film was scripted by Aaron Kandell, Jordan Kandell and David Branson Smith, and it was directed and produced by Baltasar Kormákur (who's also helmed the disaster flicks 'THE DEEP' and 'EVEREST'). It's received mixed to positive reviews from critics so far, and I found it to be somewhat involving and intense at times. The story focuses on sailors Tami Oldham (Woodley) and Richard Sharp (Claflin), who took a sailing job in 1983 and sailed right into a hurricane. The disaster left them stranded in the Pacific Ocean, with both their boat badly damaged, as well as Richard seriously wounded. It was up to Tami, the lesser experienced of the two sailors, to lead them back to Hawaii without any navigational tools. The two were also deeply in love as well. The film is well shot and acted. I'm a Shailene Woodley fan, and I was once again impressed with her starring performance in particular. The romance seems a little old and routine, and it never felt particularly emotional or heartfelt to me. The survival scenes are well done though, and Woodley makes a great reluctant action heroine (once again). There's also a nice twist that I didn't see coming, at the end. Overall the movie is pretty much exactly what I expected it to be, nothing more and nothing less, which is a 3.5 star rating (out of 5) for me.",Adrift
11,ThomasDrufke,Powerful Yet Predictably Executed,6,10 June 2018,"Balancing a love story and tragedy is just about the most difficult thing to do in a major hollywood movie. Just take two very different examples, Titanic and Pearl Harbor, for reason as to why it's not something the industry does on an often basis. But when they work, they work. Adrift manages to balance the two genres relatively well, all while giving us a harrowing and deeply emotional performance from Shailene Woodley. Most audiences will probably come because the film takes one Divergent and one Hunger Games star and combines for a love story, especially since the first film felt far more like it was taking the romantic angle on the true 1983 journey. Luckily, it never takes the dive that some teen angst films tend to do, and keeps things in a realistic and gritty execution. Besides a disappointingly predictable 3rd act ""twist"", I enjoyed my time with Adrift. Woodley continues to make her mark as one of the best in the industry at pulling off believable emotional trauma.6.6/10",Adrift
12,cricketbat,A watered-down true story,6,31 December 2018,"Adrift is based on a true event and has some pretty terrifying moments, but I feel like the plot is watered down (pun intended) and I had a hard time relating to the two leads. I kept losing interest whenever the movie would showcase more of their relationship, and wanted to return to the survival aspect of the story. If you've ever had an urge to go sailing, this movie will cure you of that.",Adrift
13,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,27 August 2018,"AdriftThe best reason to own a yacht is so that you will be able to escape your creditors.Fortunately, the couple in this drama won't have to worry about running in to any repo-men.A short while after first meeting in Tahiti, Tami Oldham (Shailene Woodley) and her new seafaring beau Richard Sharp (Sam Claflin) agree to sail his friend's 44-foot sailboat to San Diego. Midway through their voyage however the couple encounters a hurricane that not incapacitates Richard and the vessel but also veers it off course. Now it's up to Tami to steer them back home.Loosely based on actual events from 1983, this well-acted and stunningly shot retelling tampers with hard facts to create a cloying narrative that's more interested in romance than survival. Controversial to be sure, the ending weakens Oldham's real achievement.Incidentally, when lost at sea just start harpooning whales until Greenpeace shows up.

14,westsideschl,Pay Attention,5,20 September 2018,"Positive: 
Fairly decent acting out and staging of an ""adrift"" on the partially destroyed sailboat. 
Negatives:
1. That it took several decades to get this into a docudrama. 
2. A few odd scenes such as the boat in the beginning was barely above water (to the deck line) w/water pouring over the deck and into the interior, but later was almost fully afloat. 
3. Not a big fan of overly frequent flashbacks to build the story's history as it affects the flow of the tale. 
4. Check out a couple of goog searches under Tami's name especially history & Hollywood to make this ""true tale"" a bit more true and/or clear. Especially w/regard to Richard.",Adrift
15,Platypuschow,Adrift: Visual treat if nothing else,6,29 August 2018,"Adrift is a beautiful little tale about a young couple who fall foul of a severe storm while out boating.Starring the underrated Shailene Woodley and Hunger Games star Sam Claflin it at it's core is a love story but like all love stories it's also a tragedy.Based on a true story it plays out on two fronts, what is presently happening and the flashbacks that explain how it all came to be.The movie is rather devoid of originality and we have seen it all before (Even the twist) but the film does have a strong cast and excellent cinematography to fall back on and that certainly rises it above the average.I like Woodley, I expected her to have a considerably bigger career than she has and hope that competent little movies like this where she really shines can do something about that.The film is utterly beautiful and worth your time even if you'll know exactly how it's going to play out.The Good:Very well actedVisually stunningThe Bad:Hardly originalThings I Learnt From This Movie:When suffering from dehydration the best thing to do is drink alcoholWhy do I feel like Woodleys career has been eclipsed by Jennifer Lawrence?",Adrift

17,cruise01,"Isolated, wounded, and survival being the key in a film with an inspiring direction.",7,2 June 2018,"Adrift ( 3.5 out of 5 stars).Adrift is a survival drama film based on a true story of Tami Oldham (Shailene Woodley) and Richard (Sam Claflin) who are sailing from Tahiti to San Diego and getting caught in the middle of a hurricane that capsizes there boat. While adrifting in the middle of the ocean, they have to ration food supplies and trying to stay alive until they can reach the nearest land. Adrift is a pretty decent film. The romance part of the story works as Tami meets Richard and they both fall in love months before they set a long journey sail. The survival part of the story can be thrilling and heartbreaking to see. But definitely a worthy film to see. The plot follows Tami, who is adventurous and has not returned home for years. But she meets Richard, who is an avid sailor. They share stories about there personal life. They both fall for each other. Richard gets an offer from another couple, which are traveling back to England. And are offering him $10,000 to sail there boat back to San Diego. Richard and Tami agree. Until only, they get caught with hurricane Raymond. Which destroys their boat and leaves Richard severely wounded. Tami being her first time sailing. Is going to have to learn to navigate the open water and ration supplies. While the hallucinations, dehydration, and the struggle to survive keeps her moving. The film opens to the audience with Tami waking up after the hurricane has damaged their sailboat. She is wounded, confused, and lost when she gets on top to realize they are in the middle of nowhere. And Richard overboard and nowhere to be seen. Than, it flashes back to months before the hurricane and showcases of Tami meeting Richard. Going on beautiful scenery hikes, sailing, and falling for each other as they watch the sunset. The movie does work well with two different time frame narratives with one Tami and Richard trying to survive and navigate a broken sail boat. While the other is them building there relationship. Shailene Woodley did give a great performance. She is beautiful as an independent girl being adventurous and taking her time exploring around the world. Sam Claflin was good too, as a sailor and enjoys sailing in the open waters with living life on the edge facing against being isolated and trying to survive. Director Baltasar Kormakur did well with handling this survival/romance story. He captured some beautiful shots of sunset and sailing in the ocean. Delivered a thrilling hurricane sequence with a sailboat facing against giant waves that are seconds away from crushing it. The film does have a twist which some may predict it while others may be surprised and heartbroken. I did feel like the film was a bit anti climatic in the third act. It dragged a little in the last ten minutes of the movie. With a little added exposition with the character. Overall, Adrift is a pretty fair romantic drama film. With a story and concept of romance and survival were characters are facing against hallucinations, hunger, and trying to navigate the open waters. Shailene Woodley and Sam Claflin both delivered with their performances. And the two narratives worked great in keeping the pace moving with the love story and getting straight to the point with the aftermath of the hurricane. I definitely recommend seeing the film in theatres if you enjoy watching heartbreaking survival movies with a bit of a love story.",Adrift
18,Tweetienator,Another Its Gonna Be Okay,5,15 August 2018,"Sometimes it seems to me it is a burden if you know tons of very good to outstanding movies - I remember a superb one called All Is Lost from 2013 with the titan Robert Redford playing. Adrift is a fine play about a man fighting for survival against all odds on the ocean and got almost no spoken word, only the great Redford fighting against the currents and winds.Adrift is clearly no real survival movie nor plays in the same league as Adrift - too much time gets lost around the mumbo jumbo of love/romance and with the cheap technique called ""flashback"", the director/writers drown any suspense that may dare to lurk around the corner (one of the dangers of hopping around in the timeline if not well done and that's how it felt to me regarding Adrift). 
Many times ""time-hopping"" is just an easy way to fill screen-time if you got not really much to tell about the main theme and you have to cover screen-time. In All Is Lost we did not know much about the man fighting for his life but we learned a lot about him while he was fighting for his life, compared the characters of Adrift are simple card boards (typical millennials somehow lost in the sea).To sum it up: all in all Adrift is a movie for a young audience who like those actors (who did an okay job) and want the romance thing and some nice pics, and yes, some survival drama on a boat. Note: even alone on the boat the girl had nonstop to talk and scream and jumping around instead of sparing her energy for the real work - Redford did all his work with sparse mimic and gestures - Woodley behaved sometimes like a bunny on speed. Well, maybe she got some ""stuff"" with her and used it ;)Verdict: okay. But don't get confused by those inflationary 10 rate reviews made by bots, hired guns, fanboys or whatever...",Adrift
19,paul-allaer,Shailene Woodley's performance and eye-candy photography not done justice in weak narrative,6,3 June 2018,"""Adrift"" (2018 release; 96 min.) brings the story of a young couple adrift on the Pacific Ocean. As the movie opens, we find the woman (whom we later learn is named Tami) half-drowned in a boat. As she comes to her senses, she desperately looks for her travel companion (a guy named Richard), but she can't find him anywhere. The movie then shifts to ""Five Months Earlier"", as we see Tami arrive in Tahiti, the next stop of her seemingly endless tour around the world. The next day Tami and a friend get to know Richard, a nice bloke from London with a even nicer boat. At this point we're less than 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest from from Icelandic director Baltasar Kormákur, best known for another disaster movie, 2015's excellent ""Everest"". Here he brings the true story (as we are reminded at the beginning of the movie) of Tami and Richard's ordeal on the Pacific Ocean. Survival stories set on a sailboat are of course nothing new (the Robert Redford-starring ""All Is Lost"" from a few years ago immediately comes to mind), so what does this films offer that sets it apart? First and foremost, there is Shailene Woodley in the lead role of Tami (she also co-produced the movie). Woodley, best known for earlier YA films like ""The Fault In Our Stars"" and the ""Divergent"" trilogy, clearly relishes the more mature role of Tami, and she doesn't hold back in her performance, appearing in virtually every frame of the movie. Equally delightful is the amazing photography (the movie was shot in Fiji and New Zealand). Alas, neither Woodley nor the photography is done justice as the movie's overall narrative is seriously lacking. We should care deeply about this couple, but for the most part, we simply watch what happens on the big screen. Last but not least, the movie is listed on some sites as lasting 96 min, and on other sites it's listed as being 120 min. The version that I saw was definitely the short(er) version.""Adrift"" opened wide this weekend, and based on the trailer which i had caught in the theater in recent weeks, I was interested in checking it out. The Sunday matinee screening where I saw this here in Cincinnati was attended poorly (about 10-12 people). In fact, as it turns out, the movie under-performed at the box office (only $11.5 mill in its opening weekend). It's a darn shame for Shailene Woodley, who deserved better. If you keep your expectations low, I'd say check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Adrift

This movie is based on a true story that happened in 1983. A couple, Shailene and Sam, set sail in the Pacific ocean, headed to California, but they run into one of the most catastrophic hurricanes in recorded history, leaving them stranded for 40 days with little food or drinking water. The movie starts with the aftermath of the hurricane and tells what led up to this moment using flashbacks. How Shailene and Sam meet and fall in love and have their memorable sailing adventure does demonstrate the power of love and determination. There is a twist near the end that kind of threw me at first-until I figured out what was going on-and they do tell you at the end whether sailing is still a normal activity that is enjoyed by the characters portrayed by Sam and Shailene.

The infinite horizon.
After a few days, I feel reborn.
You know, just you, the wind and the sound of the boat cutting through the ocean.When you compare ""Adrift"" with the movie ""All is lost"", where Robert Redford sailed across the ocean on board of a huge sailboat, you'll notice some similarities. First of all, you can expect some idyllic footage once again. The words horizon, the setting sun, and sails that blow in the wind can be used to compose a corresponding sentence. In both films, it's an upcoming storm that ensures that the spotless sailboat is reduced to floating wreckage. And then you see an admirable struggle for survival. These being the similarities, isn't surprising. What else did you expect in a film about a shipwreck?However, there are also some significant differences. Differences which make ""Adrift"" a more interesting film. First, let's talk about the conversations. In ""All is lost"" there are as many dialogue lines as you encounter traffic lights on the ocean. None! But then again, Robert Redford was drifting all alone while Tami (Shailene Woodley) and Richard (Sam Claflin) had each other. If there would be no conversation at all, you could say those two Globetrotters weren't really meant for each other. And the trip across the Pacific would have been boring as hell for both of them in that case. The most obvious difference is the gender of the person who does everything to survive. And finally, there's the psychological aspect that reminds you immediately of ""47 Meters down"".The film can be divided into two chapters. One part before and one after the storm of course. Don't expect an apocalyptic drawn-out part with a ferocious ocean that throws the boat around like a walnut after which it finally crushes it like a coconut by a heavy stone. Otherwise, you'll be disappointed. The devastating storm itself is extremely short. The part that was given a lot of attention, is about Tami and Richard meeting each other. And on the other hand, the terrible period on a destroyed boat with a limited supply of food and something to drink. And as a vegetarian, it's even more difficult For Tami. Because catching a fish causes her to gag instead of being happy. If I'd be in a similar situation, I would throw away my morals instantly.In terms of content, both parts were interesting enough. Only the romantic stuff was a bit too much of a good thing. I understand they tried to show the contrast between the pleasant and the difficult moments. And then there's the least successful part for me. The alternation of fragments from the two different timelines with the help of recurring flashbacks. Just when you are empathizing with the dramatic part of the story, in which Tami tries to cope with the situation and does the impossible to cheer up the badly wounded Richard, they jump back to a romantic scene with those two lovebirds watching a beautiful sunset while drinking a Cuba Libre. Even though these are sometimes scenes with beautiful images, I thought it slowed down the pace and decreased the tension. After every flashback, I thought to myself ""Show up, you damn storm. Where are you?"". But once this terrible event is over, it's still a fascinating film with a well-thought-out twist.""Adrift"" isn't a bad movie. Or you hate romantic issues. Or you instantly get seasick when you look at a sailboat. What impressed me the most was the interaction between Shailene Woodley (who effortlessly transcends her acting level from ""Divergent"") and Sam Claflin. Their love relationship felt convincing and realistic. No fake moments. They were two wandering souls who met each other by chance and together undertook this adventurous trip. They aren't married yet and already they experience what it means to be together for better or for worse. The film is based on true facts. Mostly the result is a mocking chuckle when I read this. But for me the result was an enormous respect for that young girl who experienced this disaster. Tami Oldham is living proof that one should not talk about the weakness of women. She proves that women can stand their ground in certain circumstances. ""Adrift"" shows that the term ""Girlpower"" is not an empty concept. Only one advise. Best not watch this movie when you're planning to take a boat trip in the near future. I'm sure you'll start that well-deserved holiday with trembling knees.",Adrift

Who meets Richard played by Sam Clafin of the Hunger Games. who has been selling around the world. And both it seems to be love at first sight.The rest of the film of course hence the title is all about surviving. It is sad but really the real life sailing probably is beyond harder in there was probably more to the tale than a two hour movie. As they sail for a trip of a lifetime. Unknowing as this is based on a true story as it takes place in 1983. Tami is estranged from her family and wants to be independent. While Richard himself faces his own personal crisis.Both make a great couple and must battle a hurricane that unbeknowest to them is coming to them. It is about survival but also show the love that each has one to the other. You all need to bring the Kleenix as you will need to.,Adrift
27,rgkarim,"Drifting Towards Beautiful and Inspiring Visions, At a Stranded Pace",6,1 June 2018,"The words based on a true story are always good tags to hook audience members into the cinema. Seeing humans go through these extreme vents brings a sense of thrilling adventure in hopes of crafting a story that one can relate to. Tonight's story promises such a thing, as young actor and actress set out to the expanse of the sea, facing the unhindered forces that lie in waiting. Robbie K back with another review, helping share his thoughts on the movie: Film: AdriftDirector:
 Baltasar Kormákur
Writers:
 Aaron Kandell, Jordan Kandell 
Stars:
 Shailene Woodley, Sam Claflin, Grace Palmer LIKES:Cinematography: The movie's high point is the beautiful shots of the big, blue, wet thing (ocean) and the beauty and terror it contains. Adrift spends a lot of time on the surface of the Pacific, so it's natural for them to have to find unique angles to fully immerse you in the journey of being stranded at sea. You'll get to transition from boat, to under the sea, to the beautiful horizons that paint the setting and with appreciating the serene calm sailing can bring. Acting: Claflin and Woodley captain the ship of this film pretty much the whole time, so if you aren't a fan of their work... then sit this one out. However, for the rest of the crew, the combo does a decent job of crafting their respective characters from whatever proverbial clay they were written in. Claflin shines in the loner, philosophical voyager, opening up new doors for Woodley's character to walk through and continue the story. Woodley though has the hardest job of the bunch, going from the vagabond, see the world atmosphere to the survivor against the odds role. Seeing her unleash the fury of exhaustion, dehydration, and potential delirium is epic, but not as much as watching her take control of the nightmare that life cast on her. All in all, not the strongest acting chemistry, but still a grand craft. The Makeup: Having to transform the actors from normal hipsters to sickly, on the verge of death of those stuck without many supplies. The cosmetics involved in this production are phenomenal, subtle transitions taking place to document the strain the sea and sun are providing on the days long journey. Whether it's the paling complexion of blistering skin, to the wound inflicted from the hurricane storm, you'll get chills at the realism to these visuals. The Presentation: As mentioned in my pre-review vlog, I worried about a very monotonous presentation where it would just be a thousand sequences of drifting crafted together. While this is still true, the team brought a presentation style that managed to break up the monotony of the shots. Adrift is a mixture of past and present, intertwining between the two the way waves merge in a storm. You'll start out in the present, but quickly dart back into the past, trying to connect motivations and background to the matters at hand. It does a decent job of balancing the two timelines, and helps give some more depth to the leads, even though one doesn't speak much during much of the present. 
The Twist: Get ready for the doozy of a twist my friends, because Adrift has got one for you. Pay attention and you might get it within three minutes of the start of the film, yet go in there without the power of observation will be blown away by the surprise. I can't go much more into that, so let's move on. DISLIKES:Predictable Ending: Come on... if it's based on a true story, you kind of know what is going to happen if someone made it back to tell the tale. Adrift's setting is still a remarkable feat of survival, but you know what the ending is going to be...mostly. As such, the suspense gets a little ebbed from this and as such takes away from the entertainment value for me. Semi-Developed Characters: Also, from my pre-review, you know that I feared them skirting over character details due to some attention being strung elsewhere (cough love cough). Adrift met this expectation in full for me. While not the flattest characters, there was still a lot more to explore and develop in their lives. However, the back-forth presentation led to some choppy scenes that left little time to really expand on the characters past drop the bomb lines. I'll admit, they are strategically placed, but the development is disjointed and over run by the Sparks' like presentation of love and connection. So much potential, again lost to love antics. The Presentation: Yes, I liked the presentation breaking up the movie, but at the same time they went a little overboard switching between timelines. At segments of the movie, the crew left little time to become immersed into the scene, before pulling the rug out and tripping you back to a small detail. These switches got annoying at points and one or two transitions edited out could have made for more conducive scenes, see near the end during the hurricane moments. The Length/Pace: Despite all their best attempts though, Adrift still cannot sail away from the slow currents of presentation. It's a slow movie, and drags at parts that made even my friend sigh in boredom as we waited for something to happen. One hopes you enjoy the cinematography, because you are going to get a lot of it as you wait. The hurricane scene doesn't come in until past the halfway point, and when combined with the predictable ending... it's only the drama left to fill in the time. Therefore, if you go solo or at least without a date, you're going to feel the 2-hour time length of this movie. The VERDICT:  Adrift is not a bad movie, it's just one that needs a little wind to the sails to justify the two-hour runtime tagged with it. Sure, beautiful settings, a decent acting, and a twist give it some momentary squalls to blow through the time, but overall the movie floats on dead water, I guess to give you the full experience. I acknowledge the feats the main character accomplishes, but it's place for immersion is in the form of the books that document, instead of the big budget shooting that we got. Those looking for drama and love are the key audience here, but otherwise skip this film for something else coming in a few weeks, or is already here. My scores are:Action/Adventure/Drama: 6.5
Movie Overall: 5.5",Adrift
28,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Adrift,7,9 June 2018,"Adrift is an ample love story, a factual account, and a shimmering tale of nautical survival. As far as new releases go in 2018, Adrift is like All Is Lost except that it has a non-linear narrative, less peril, and a heck of a lot more dialogue. Note to Adrift's helmer, Baltasar Kormakur: Robert Redford called and wants his fixer upper can of epoxy back. Also, George Clooney phoned in and wants his scruffy, fisherman's beard back too. Finally, is there any way you could re-shoot Adrift in say, chronological order? I'm not saying what you did was second-rate. It's just arrant curiosity that's all. Anyway, Adrift has affable leads (in the form of Shailene Woodley and Sam Claflin), sympathetic performances, a kissing scene straight outta From Here to Eternity, a stirring musical score, and an ""I see dead people"" twist that I didn't ""sea"" coming. In retrospect, Adrift may be a little cut and dry for the Academy but it's far more poignant than any handheld, Open Water sequel. Director Baltasar Kormakur shoots Adrift by cutting profusely between flashbacks and present day sequences. He creates a film that is stylish, lifelike, and subversive. Basically, his water level vision is all his own.Kormakur's main focus is on drifter slash free spirit, Tami Oldham (played by Shailene Woodley who's mentioned earlier in the review). Tami befriends and falls in love with a mariner named Richard Sharp (played by Sam Claflin, also mentioned earlier). After a courtship of nearly five months, Tami and Richard get an offer to sail somebody's boat from Tahiti to San Diego, CA for $10,000. Chaos ensues when a hurricane causes said boat to ruin and drift hundreds of miles away from its intended destination. With minimal food, other minimal resources, and Sharp's leg and ribs being badly broken, the dedicated couple tries to keep from dying in the middle of the ocean.In conclusion, Adrift has a weak sort of foundation for creating the look of 1983. Plus, the commercial nature of this flick, its various plot holes, and its far-fetched complexion of Tami's sailing skills keep it from fully doing justice via a true story fashion. Oh well. The acting pulls you through and the main characters are adorable and genuine. You feel their plight and their winsome chemistry without any pretension. My rating: 3 stars.",Adrift
29,Luigi Di Pilla,Adrift meets Titanic,7,27 June 2020,Adrift is a very sentimental film near to the Titanic film. It is an emotional and some adventure In a romance love story that ended with tears in my eyes. It was never boring and it took me together away on high sea with the two lovers. Both actors did a great job. If you like this genre of movies I highly recommend to see The Perfect Storm or the other survival movie All is Lost. 7/10,Adrift
30,baumer,Shaileen is incredible and the film is really good. Go in knowing nothing,9,2 June 2018,"A film that starts off as part survival adventure, part Nicholas Sparks love story. At first I began to question why they made the choice to inter cut between the present and then the past...how they met, fell in love and ultimately accepted an offer to sail a boat from Tahiti to San Diego. But then near the end, it all comes together and if it wasn't hard enough watching the movie, fearing the worse for Richard, then the one small twist just destroyed me, left in puddles.  After Spielberg finished Jaws, he told anyone that would listen, to never film on the open sea, ever. The elements, the waves, the weather and everything in between basically cause chaos. Director Baltasar Kormakur did not take heed to that warning and the result is something magical. To get the feeling of complete isolation, the cast and crew would sail out 2 hours from land to film. Kormakur is an experienced sailor and I'm sure that came in handy during filming. Half of the movie takes place on the open water and slowly but surely you see the two characters start to fade. They haven't given up hope but they are 1500 miles from land, have little food and little water. How Tammy and Richard survived 41 days on their own is a miracle. Tammy had to do it all. Take care of Richard, keep the boat afloat, catch food, make shelters and so on. There were times when she was in tears and close to going crazy, but she kept going, incredibly reaching Hawaii. She was not the experienced sailor, that was Richard. That makes it all the more incredible. There's one big plot twist and I will not reveal that here. If you know nothing about the story, keep it that way. Go in blind. It'll work so much better for you. Shaileen owns the movie. She's simply a rock. Her range of emotions are incredible and she has to carry the film most of the way. Claflin is good too but Woodley has much more to do. I simply love her performance and I really hope she gets a nomination this year. She's simply brilliant. I loved the movie. 9/10",Adrift

33,rockman182,Adrift (2018),7,4 June 2018,"I wanted to see Adrift because I do enjoy shipwreck or ocean disaster based films. They usually end up being grand visually and are a great reminder of how cruel nature can be. Adrift is based on a true story and looked like a mix of a romantic film and a survival film. It is pretty much that. I think the plot and timeline jumping does not always work but the film is anchored by a truly great performance by Shailene Woodley and some harrowing but memorable moments.The film is about the true story of Tami Oldham and Richard Sharp. Both quickly fall in love with each other and share a common love for sailing. On one expedition, they sail into a dangerous hurricane. The hurricane was so fierce that it leaves Richard with incapacitating injuries and Tami left to steer their ruined boat to survival despite all odds being against them. She soon realizes that this is a mental as well as a physical battle. The film stars Shailene Woodley and Sam Claflin.Baltasar Kormákur does not always impress with his directional efforts although Everest worked for its cinematography and subject matter. Its more or less the same for Adrift. The cinematography of the oceanic terrain is beautiful and the storm scene was done very well. The plot is a bit thin and often not as focused on the duo's survival as it should. The timeline jumps back and forth between present events and the couple at an earlier time. I don't think this always works. Yes, there is good chemistry between Woodley and Claflin, I just didn't think going back to their love story was as effective for focusing on the aftermath of disaster.This is by far the best Shailene Woodley performance I have seen. The film is what it is because she takes hold of the role and is so convincing. Her determination, hopelessness, drive, and struggle is all displayed perfectly. There are two distinct passages in the film that deal with her hallucinations at sea. I thought they were fantastic and real standout moments in the film and displayed psychological toll of being adrift for so long. Not a perfect film but does what it needs to do right.7/10",Adrift
34,jon.h.ochiai,Love makes you strong,9,12 June 2018,"In the heartbreaking scene in ""Adrift"" weary sun-ravaged Tammy, played by Shailene Woodley, awakes next to wounded lover Richard, played by Sam Clafin, on their wrecked sailboat in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Tammy cries out loud, ""Oh my... We're gonna die!"" Shailene is so vulnerable, so powerful as Tammy in her impossible journey home. She owns this movie. She compels all of us to watch in awe. Director Baltasar Kormakur's ""Adrift"" tells the tragic true story of Tammy and Richard's sailing voyage from Tahiti to San Diego during Hurricane Raymond in 1983. ""Adrift"" is based on the book by Tammy Ashcraft, the Tammy in the movie. Aaron Kandell, Jordan Kandell, and David Branson Smith wrote the harrowing screenplay based on her book. Shailene is awesome. I've been a fan since ""The Descendants"" and ""The Fault in Our Stars"". As Tammy she is frightened and fierce, her emotions are raw, to the bone. ""Adrift"" is predictable in the sense that it's the true story, with the known outcome. Yet, the eloquent narrative twist got me. It landed. Outcome aside, Shailene boldly portrays Tammy's transformation of greater. No. What doesn't kill you, doesn't make you stronger. Love makes you stronger. Really. Weakened Richard reminds Tammy, ""You can do anything you put your mind to."" Have faith within. As the movie opens 23 year-old Tammy arrives in Tahiti with no particular plans, other than work and to get by. She works maintenance at the local dock. Tammy's passion is sailing, for the open seas. She really has no one in her life. Her Mom had her when she was 14 years-old, and was virtually raised by her Grandparents. Her Dad was kind to her, whenever he visited town, until that stopped. Seems the sea embodied Tammy's own personal freedom. Tammy meets rogue sailing Richard, who sails the ocean without any clear purpose in mind after graduating from the London Royal Navy Academy. Tammy and Richard discover each other as soulmates. Here Director Kormakur falters a tad, the romance blossoms as rather canny. Gratefully, Shailene and Sam infuse their courtship with awkward charm and humorous sense of wonder. Tammy and Richard fall in love. We see their touching screen chemistry swimming in the isolated cove or dancing at the local dive bar. Richard's friends Peter and Christine, played by generous Jeffrey Thomas and Elizabeth Hawthorne, ask Richard as a favor to sail their yacht back to San Diego. They have to fly home from Tahiti, because of a family crisis. Richard and Tammy agree.On the voyage to San Diego, Tammy and Richard sail into the eye of the category 5 Hurricane Raymond. The storm nearly demolishes the boat leaving them ""Adrift"" in the middle of the Pacific, thousands of miles from land. The movie opens as Tammy arises from the flooded cabin searching for Richard. It's on. The nightmare perpetuates under the glaring sun, with little food and drinkable water. Shailene's Tammy valiantly endures. At the touching narrative arc, Tammy says, ""I love you..."" Love makes you strong. It keeps you going. Love makes you endure all the bad in hope of the new day. ""Adrift"" is about the love the keeps us all alive, that keeps us strong.",Adrift

37,dave-mcclain,great chemistry between the leads - and terrific use of flashback structure,8,2 June 2018,"""Adrift"" (PG-13, 2:00) is an action-adventure drama-romance produced and directed by Baltasar Kormákur (""Everest"", ""2 Guns"", ""The Deep"") and written by David Branson Smith (""Ingrid Goes West"") and Aaron and Jordan Kandell (""Moana""), based on the book by Tami Ashcraft. Unlike most movies dramatizing something that actually happened, this one doesn't begin with the usual qualifiers of ""Based on a true story"" or ""Inspired by a true story"". This one tells us simply, ""This is a true story.""Tami Oldham (Golden Globe and Emmy nominee Shailene Woodley) is a single 24-year-old adventurer, originally from San Diego, who works her way from place to place on a worldwide voyage of self-discovery. As the film opens, she gets off a boat in Tahiti and responds to the custom agent's questions by admitting she doesn't have an occupation or any idea how long she'll be staying in the country. In spite of her apparent aimlessness, she gets her passport stamped and starts working at the docks doing maintenance on various pleasure craft. That's where she meets the handsome and charming Richard Sharp (Sam Claflin), who is in the process of sailing around the world on a journey similar to Tami's.Tami and Richard are well on their way to falling in love when a wealthy older couple ask Richard to sail their yacht to San Diego, in exchange for $10,000 and a First Class airline ticket back to Tahiti. Make that two First Class tickets. Tami says she's not ready to go home yet, but she doesn't want to be separated from her new love, so she comes along for the ride... and, as a novice sailor herself, to help out where she can. Unfortunately for the young lovers, they get caught up in a monster storm at sea that damages the boat - and each of them - severely. The best solution seems to be allowing the prevailing currents to carry the boat east, try to navigate towards Hawaii - and try to survive long enough to get there.""Adrift"" is this film's title, but the story is anything but. Appearing in flashbacks, the story of Tami and Richard is told parallel with the story of the journey to Hawaii. It's an especially effective plot device in this intelligent screenplay. The two leads are each first class actors who play their roles expertly and with undeniable chemistry. This film compares well with Robert Redford's ""All is Lost"" and Tom Hanks' ""Cast Away"", with the added allure of the romance and the strong foundation of being a true story. ""A-""",Adrift
38,jrarichards,Not-too-innovative but real-looking presentation of an amazing ocean story,7,4 May 2019,"Let's first assume that anybody opting to watch a 96-minute film called ""Adrift"" is going to have at least a vague idea of what they are letting themselves in for! Personally speaking, I find these kinds of films intriguing given the presence of inievitable tensions of two kinds. First, there is the age-old truth of the ocean being seductive and gorgeous on the one hand, wet/cold and amazingly uncomfortable and hostile on the other. It's full of life but fundamentally inimical to human life. And on that basis, ever-capable, enduring, resilient human beings are always - to not coin any phrase - one wave away from being ""in deep water"", ""out of their depth"", ""in dire straits"", and so on and so forth.The fact that we have those expressions so readily to hand just makes the whole issue clear.A personal favourite film in this genre is ""Open Water 2"", in which human incompetence and compounded errors overwhelm various attempts at ingenuity in the face of a ludicrous oversight occurring early on in the film. ""Open Water 1"" - a quite separate entity - mainly reminded us how vast and deep the sea is. Not so the little stretch of sea featured in ""The Shallows"", even though Blake Lively's distinctly competent character again faces enormous danger in the aquatic environment.In ""Adrift"", our heroes (and lovers) - American Tami (Shailene Woodley) and Brit Richard (Sam Claflin) - are people who know the ocean and are competent in it, but that cannot help them much when the 44-foot yacht they are sailing (for someone else) faces up to a full-blown hurricane miles out from anywhere. Later on, they have their resources and reserves to fall back on, but there was nothing they could have done to prevent the situation arising.Given that this is basically a true story from 1983, Baltasar Kormakur's 2018 film is in some sense beyond criticism. Nevertheless, with the main story a given, the flashback mode of telling it is picturesque but not especially enthralling, while we cannot claim to be witnessing any particular innovations in camerawork. The settings and circumstances look authentic, however.But the film is (of course) impressive in its way anyway, and does have a kind of a twist in the tale to offer...And, since I am basically intrigued by these kinds of movies, as I noted above, the chance to watch another was not one I would pass by - perhaps in some kind of vicarious testing of my own resolve v cowardice, and ultimately just in admiration for that still-untamed vast chunk of our planet that is the open ocean.In these kinds of contexts, ""Adrift"" serves the purpose quite well enough...",Adrift
39,bob-the-movie-man,Everybody doesn't love (Hurricane) Raymond,9,3 July 2018,"""Should we be worried"" says Tami. Well, yes dear, you really should.In the glorious surroundings of Tahiti, the American footloose traveller Tami Oldham (Shailene Woodley, ""Divergent trilogy"", ""The Descendents) meets British footloose traveller Richard Sharp (Sam Claflin, ""Journey's End"", ""Me Before You"") and a nautical-based love beckons. Richard is hired by his friends Peter (Jeffrey Thomas) and Christine (Elizabeth Hawthorne) to sail their luxury 44 foot yacht Hazana from Tahiti to Tami's home city of San Diego. But they hadn't reckoned on the decidedly un-romantic attentions of Raymond and severely battered and bruised it's a battle for survival on the vast expanse of the Pacific.As a story with romantic undertones, the film will live or die on your belief in this aspect. And fortunately the romance works. There is real chemistry between the pair despite them striking you as an odd couple. This is in no small part to the quality of the acting: Claflin proves again that he is a safe pair of hands as a male lead, but it's Shailene Woodley, who has to carry large portions of the film single-handedly, who again demonstrates just how excellent an actress she is. The camera of Tarentino favourite Robert Richardson (""The Hateful Eight"", ""Django Unchained"") stays tightly on Woodley's features dramatically capturing her tiniest of grimaces. Woodley is also deliciously un-Hollywood, getting to where she has through acting talent as much as her looks. Yes, she has a great body (liberally, perhaps a tad lasciviously, featured here both above and under the water) but her face is gloriously assymettical with little wrinkles appearing unexpectedly when she grins. She's a good role model for young girls that perfection is not a pre-requisite for success. It's also interesting to note that the 27-year old Woodley is also a co-producer on the film, a sign perhaps that as well as being the 'Meryl Streep of the future'(TM), she is also likely to become a significant mover and shaker in Hollywood when getting there.A bit like ""The Shallows"", it's unapologetically a B movie, but it's delivered with such style and chutzpah that it drives its way through the apallingly cheesy dialogue just as the poor Hazana bashes its way throught the mountainous seas. It's even self-mocking, with Tami rolling her eyes at the corniness of Richard's, very English, attempts at romantic dialogue. The script is more successful in establishing back-stories for Tami and Richard, demonstrating a degree of parallelism that perhaps better explains their mutual attraction. The irony of fate taking Tami back to her damaged past is exquisite. A controversial and brave decision by Icelandic director Baltasar Kormákur is to constantly flashback between the survival scenes and Tami and Richard's courtship that leads up to the cataclismic event. This can be a little distracting, but given the gut-wrenching twist in the third act a linear storytelling would simply have not worked. It's very well done too, with matched cross-cuts that really work well. Kormákur's previous film ""Everest"" was his biggest hit to date, and I noted the cheeky addition of the book ""Everest"" on the bookshelf on Richard's boat!Extraordinarily, it's a true story with the closing frames of the film being genuinely moving. With many similarities to the excellent Robert Redford thriller ""All Is Lost"", this is a robust and enthralling thriller-cum-romance that unusually delivers on both counts. The romance is believable and the thrills suitably thrilling, especially when a panic-ridden Tami is separated from her one patch of dry land. Although slightly let down by some dodgy dialogue, sitting amongst all the big-hitter summer blockbusters this is a movie you should definitely seek out.(For the full and graphical version of this review, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com or One Mann's Movies on Facebook.

I was never bored.They could have handled the twist with better care.That said, there's nothing at all that's stands out as just plain bad.

41,tonypeacock-1,"Cliché filled, confusing mess",4,11 November 2018,"An unoriginal time waster is how I would best describe this low budget film.
It is full of cliché's I've seen in far to many films regarding a boat adrift all at sea, for a very long time.
What adds to the confusion is the two timelines that zip from one to another without warning. These different timelines try and add to a clever twist toward the end which I will praise the writers for.
The film adds little to the genre of surviving, hallucinating sailors. Like a mirage.",Adrift
42,springfieldrental,Photography is stunning,8,6 June 2018,"Never mind that Adrift shows the human ability to survive the most harshest and frightening elements that this earth has to offer. It's the photography that I really appreciated in this story of a couple's effort to brave the ordeal of being thrashed around in the Pacific Ocean during a Category 4 typhoon. Right from the opening sequence, Icelandic director Baltasar Kormakur has his cinematographer Robert Richardson photograph a long tracking shot of Shailene Woodley splashing about in the cabin of a waterlogged sailboat looking for her fiancee and trying to get her bearings. As she emerges from down below, Richardson continues the shot with an invisible wipe of an ocean wave above the boat before Woodley realizes her boyfriend is missing. The breathtaking sequence sets the pace for what is an amazingly rich tapestry of photographic wonders.One other particularly unusual shot is when Ms. Woodley dives into a river from a cliff while her boyfriend Sam Claflin is concerned about her well-being when she doesn't come out of the water. Richardson's camera parallels him as he leaps from the cliff, following him into the water and continuing underneath the water's surface until he finds Woodley alive. Those two shots alone are worth the price of admission. Never mind that the story is riveting, despite some sequences where landlubbers would consider slow at times. Otherwise, Adrift should get at least an Academy Award nomination for cinematography--it is that good.",Adrift

This combined with the flashback/present storytelling had me frustrated - but as the two stories unfolded, they began to complement each other quite well.'Adrift' is all a bit sad - but when it's pairing Shailene Woodley (The Fault in Our Stars) with Sam Claflin (Me Before You) it's to be expected!The depiction of the hurricane itself left me breathless - excellent cinematography that made me feel like I was about to be washed overboard. It threw me back to stories my sailor friend told me of her solo skippering of a yacht through a hurricane in the Atlantic (mental note: get her opinion on this!)The tension and drama is effectively cranked up at times too. It's no surprise that this was directed by Baltasar Kormákur of 'Everest' fame. I enjoyed the plot twist, which I felt took the film to a new level.

51,HEFILM,lack of chemisty and clunky flashback structure hurt,4,2 June 2018,"In order to avoid a slow build to the disaster that results in 2 people being adrift the movie decides to start mid story and then jump around in time. This is a mistake as we are in a film that is a race against time and this flashbacking robs us from having a sense of urgency.Woodley is better on her own than in scenes with her co star and either neither is that good or they just aren't that good together--there is no chemistry between them.I'm a sucker for this kind of alone against the sea story so I gave it more of a chance than my wife, who was bored through most of it.Nicely but not memorably shot by Robert Richardson mostly know for his work with Oliver Stone and now Quentin Tarantino. A forgettable music score doesn't help things either. Special effects are pretty seemless which helps you believe you are alone in the ocean so that's a plus and something that can't be said for THE PERFECT STORM which was loaded with fake looking ocean waves and Impossible to believe action.Sort of silly disclaimer at the end about tobacco products in the film--for the record nobody actually smokes the tobacco products briefly depicted.The movie is better than the Robert Redford alone in a boat movie--which was NOT based on a true story.This movie just feels padded and lifeless for too much of it's run time and I sense the actors lack of chemistry doesn't help though the writing and amount of flashbacks may be to blame.There is no visual plan to this film which also doesn't help, the screws never tighten and there is also sort of a story gimic that works and is true to life but still isn't totally believable.It's not a bad movie but never really takes off.",Adrift

54,kaptenvideo-89875,"Youngsters at sea, hurricane attacking, things looking bleak...",6,4 July 2018,"Teenagers meeting the perils of real life is a well-established YA (young adult) movie subgenre, and Shailene Woodley may be one of its biggest stars, at least in the U.S.Starting with surprisingly gripping Christian teen soap ""The Secret Life of American Teenager"", she has also appeared, among other stuff, ""The Fault in Our Stars"" and ""Divergent"" trilogy. ""Adrift"" is certainly a solid addition to her 'hard life on screen' theme.A young couple (Shailene Woodley, Sam Claflin) sailing on ocean get hit by hurricane, are left with damaged boat and have to endure a lot to get back to civilization.It's quite common for YA movie to also be at least partly about survival but ""Adrift"" is also one of the few realistic ones. Meaning it's based on a true story from the beginning of 1980's.Both leads, Woodley and Claflin, are very likable and authentic to make the audience care about their challenges.I especially like how Woodley has covered up her natural prettiness to become adventurous spirit she's supposed to be. Instead of having perfect tan, she never looks her best in the movie, always sunburnt or physically suffering like the character's life dictates.""Adrift"" may be made for PG-13 crowd, but the overall quality should make it attractive choice for fans of survival tales of any age. There's nothing new exactly, considering the genre, but it's well made and honest enough to deserve a nod.If one is not into sea and/or sailing, it's quite difficult to understand the charms of such endeavour.As one of the main characters admits, most time will be spent sunburnt, sleep deprived, seasick or possibly all three at once, and always hungry. But watching the others suffer like is not the worst way to spend hour and a half, eh?Those who haven't seen such kind of a screen story before - such as ""The Mercy"" starring Colin Firth released in March - may want to give ""Adrift"" a higher score. I, on the other hand, am good with 6 out of 10, deeming it solid but not caring about the whole thing as deeply as I'd like to.The problem with 'sailers at great risk' movies is that it's really hard to build and maintain suspense here.You already know what's gonna happen (they either die or survive), also there's not gonna be much interesting dialogue or character development to make one care deeply, and ultimately, there's not enough to form a deep emotional connection to.Characters mope around on the deck, etc. Begs the question of how the actually pass the time, what do they eat, where they crap and piss - most of which is left unanswered because it would not make a great movie material.And one of the big developments during the end seems rather ham-fisted, drifting apart from what really happened, diminishing the girl power message that the movie wants to convey, and conveniently happening just because story demands it right meow.The scenes of ocean attacking the boat are awesome and easily the most gripping part of ""Adrift"".Sadly they are rather short and scarce, leading the audience back to monotone existence of being on a boat. Or flashbacks of how the couple met and started the journey, which are fine by themselves but lack dramatic punch to add heft to the overall story.",Adrift
55,jb_campo,Stays afloat but drags,6,24 February 2019,"Adrift suffers from the same problem as other stranded-on-a-boat movies like Life of Pi and All is Lost. When is enough, enough. Even though Adrift is only 90 minutes long, near the end, I couldn't wait for a conclusion because it was tiring to keep watching the mundane tasks of trying to save yourselves on a 50-foot boat over 41 days.Shailene Woodley stars as Tami, a care-free 23-year old who travels around the world for 5 years, making enough money with odd jobs to pay for her life choice. Sam Claflin co-stars as Richard, the man she meets and falls in love with in Tahiti.The director Baltasar Kormaker is no stranger to disaster movies. He directed Everest about the doomed ascent. In Adrift, he tackles the water version of survival. The direction is top notch, drawing on every ounce of pity he can from the audience for these poor souls enduring the battle of survival in the middle of nowhere, figuring they are more likely to die than survive. The screenplay is also quite good. You start out with Tami waking up in a water-filled cabin. she starts freaking out looking for Richard. The screenplay then goes back to the beginning, so you are on the complete opposite of the time line, where you start to learn about the stars and how they came to meet.That storytelling method worked quite well, because the stories started to come together and you started to understand what happened.But despite excellent cinematography, and decent music, the movie starts to drag. I wondered how the heck such experienced sailors didn't do a better job of scouting the weather. But this is based on a real life story, so it's unclear what parts are fact and what are Hollywood.The ending somewhat sinks the movie, falling into that same genre as Life of Pi or 47 meters down, touching on the Sixth Sense even. I understand the director's and the screen playwrights rationale, but it doesn't make it any easier to swallow.You end up with an ah-ha ending, and I found myself crying while being disappointed at the same time.Adrift is a good tear-jerker movie, with really good acting. The screenplay is pretty good, so overall, a decent movie. It will make you harken back to the days when you were in your early 20s and wanted to be free to see the world and not submit to the routine of life. All good things, and it makes Adrift a worthy film for you to watch.

57,patriciogl10,"Solid performances, on point storytelling, and an impassioned story all packed up in an interesting tale of love and survival.",8,29 August 2018,"I'm a sucker for lost-at-sea type of movies and I found myself thoroughly enjoying this great film, as I expected. With this kind of plot it's almost obligatory for the acting to be exceptional, and this was no exception. Shailene Woodley conveys a highly convincing performance, and manages to considerably increase the tension and the drama as the film progresses. Her acting felt so real, and it was beautifully accompanied by Sam Claflin, who gives a solid supporting performance. The structure of the film is remarkable, starting with the aftermath of the storm that left Tami Oldham (Shailene Woodley) and Richard Sharp (Sam Claflin) in an unfavourable state and from then, flashbacks are interwoven as we get to see the beginning of their relationship, the present time when they are adrift, the growth of their connection, then back and forth with their struggle for survival. Following this ingenious storytelling, the film slowly starts to unveil the actual cause of the disaster: a huge powerful storm that turns their world upside down. The flashback scenes finally catch up to the present while we meet a clever twist that was creatively disguised all along as a resourceful plot device.The cinematography was stunning, specially when it focused on sunsets; and the open sea is just a marvellous beauty to witness. In my opinion the special effects during the climax of the film could have been done a bit better, but in general, it was okay.The structure of the narrative, Woodley's performance and of course the moving story of struggle, love and survival almost guarantees an attachment to the film. At one point, I was immersed in the story and found myself shedding a tear or two thanks to Shailene's touching delivery.If you like movies such as Castaway, All is Lost, Life of Pi and In the Heart of the Sea, you will be pleased by this fine feature film. Even if you are already familiar with the story, since it is based on true events, you cannot help but to submerge deep into the storytelling, and come out of the sea of emotions wondering what would you do if something like this ever happens to you.",Adrift
58,mcjensen-05924,Why Are People Being So Kind?,2,24 June 2021,"There is nothing here that hasn't been done before, and the others that have done it have accomplished it far better. This might have worked if it was done chronologically rather than all the distracting flashbacks, which rarely work in a movie anyway. But you'd also need a different script and need to re-cast it so there's some talented actors and actresses. This reeks of fake, overwrought sentimentality. The love story came across as so contrived and overly sweet I got a few cavities from trying to watch the romance develop. Plus all the unlikely or impossible coincidences were just a bit much to swallow. The inconsistencies and lack of attention to detail also dragged this down, as if the awful acting wasn't enough of a deterrent. An example: how can the sailboat be listing badly to one side after the storm, then miraculously it's level and she's sailing it with a makeshift sail to rescue what's his name who she just happens to spot. Eye roll here. Oh, and she'd never be able to get him back onboard. No way, but it was soooo easy! C'mon......things like that piled on top of one another are just too much to keep interest alive.

The movie opens with Tami alone adrift in the boat, and cannot find Richard who is believed thrown overboard. Then the movie bounces back and forth between Tami being adrift and on Tahiti when Tami and Richard meet and fall in love. Actually, I think the movie spent too much time on land with Tami and Richard and the chemistry wasn't there. 
Later Tami thinks she sees Richard holding onto some board and she jumps in and goes after him. The operative word here is ""thinks."" Anyway, Richard's ribs are broken and his legs are totally useless and Tami comforts him and learns more about sailing and does the best she can. The ocean scenes are very good. 
Later on we get to see the big storm (Raymond) that caused all, and we see Richard in Yellow Rain Gear being thrown overboard. But when Tami rescues Richard he is not wearing the Yellow Rain Gear. 
The banter between Tami and Richard is most important because Tami , later will say, that it was Richard who kept her alive. 
Shailene Woodley is a very good actress, and she does a very good job of carrying this movie.

It's a toughie to talk about without spoilers, so I will just say that some of it is exciting, some of it is indeed sappy, but it has a twist that left me cold and I was glad when it was over. Even though Sam Caflin has been in quite a few projects, he's never been in anything that interested me, so he was new to me and he is an appealing and likeable actor. Woodley, who also produced, I have seen a number of times, but here to me she was less interesting or appealing and looks a bit old for the role to me though she really wasn't that far off.

69,JurijFedorov,"It's fine, there is nothing new here",6,27 September 2021,"It's a fun enough movie to watch as it's about survival so you always have a story to follow. There is never a time where the plot doesn't seem clear or feels pointless. You get a survival story from A to Z. First disaster, then try to find land and so forth. I'm a huge sucker for these stories and especially for such reallife boat survival stories that are extremely simple yet extremely powerful and stay with you. This is based on a real story so it has that little bit of extra to it.Now, the movie unfortunately has some glaring holes in it that makes this a film you may as well skip. If you love slice of life stories this is ideal for you, but overall it's not a strong film even though it's fun enough to watch.Firstly, everything here is told via flashbacks. So you jump back and forth every scene. Meaning that the disaster struck already in the first scene and we continue that plot line of the survival on the boat, but the story of what happened is shown throughout the movie via flashbacks so you first see the disaster itself at the very end. So the flashbacks are when the couple meet till they reach the disaster. And the other storyline is the survival on the boat. So instead of giving us a really strong movie about survival it feels like 2 different movies cut together. One is a boring love story where a couple just makes out and smiles - stuff that's frankly boring in movies. The other part is the survival. It of course doesn't work at all. This needs to be recut to be a linear story to really be a powerful and emotional story. Flashbacks just take you out of the story unfortunately and you never feel the suffering or starvation fully.The acting is great. I probably didn't get 5-10% of the dialogue because they went for a realistic style where even the music of the movie often overshadows the dialogue. Which is fine as most lines are pointless lines about romance, love or just observations. It's not strong dialogue, but the acting is great.The survival story is not the main focus unfortunately. We don't really see any great struggle. She seems fit and energized even the very moment she is saved and because of the constant flashbacks there is not much survival they have time to show. A bit fishing and some small repair work is basically what we get. The relationship is the main focus.It's not a bad movie. But it could have been way better just via better editing and then cutting out 15 minutes of the relationship scenes. It's fine to watch a few such romance scenes, but it just continues forever and many scenes are the same. Dinner and romance repeated in 10 different settings. We get it, I'm not a hater it's just way too much. The power of it goes away after some time for sure.You could watch it. You could skip it. Either choice is fine. If you love romance stories this is for you. It's also slice of life and ""survival"". So not terrible, but kinda a missed shot and nothing should make you want to watch it over any better and newer movie. There are way better boat survival stories, but still very few. So this is one you watch if you have watched all the others already.",Adrift

76,rabbitmoon,"Don't believe the studio shill reviews - this is a terrible, terrible film",1,29 June 2018,"Here are the major flaws of this film:There is zero chemistry between the leads. Absolutely soulless writing. The characters have no quirks, depth, idiosyncracies, anxieties, neuroses, anything that would resemble a human being. They both talk like their lines were written by a 15 year old writing a very self-conscious romance, trying to impress their teacher. Sam Claflin plays his usual sociopathic-seeming emotionally-flat charmer, every line delivered like an arrogant banker impersonating 90s Hugh Grant. Its impossible to care at all about these people - I wanted them to suffer badly and was annoyed that sharks or dismemberment didn't happen. Anything you read about squeamish survival scenes is a lie - its a 12 certificate. The structure... oh God the structure. It flashes back and forward with no obvious purpose, succeeding to kill any emotional investment its attempting to build. There is a major scene towards the end akin to the space-station exploding at the start of Gravity which sets off the 'current' events of the film (with the same 'drifting' thing), yet rather than begin with it like Gravity did (creating an ""oh no!"" moment to raise tension/suspense for what follows), it simpers up to it - then kills it with more flashbacks and...The most unnecessary, forced twist you could imagine. Once its revealed, it contradicts the emotional tone of the scene by giving a few MORE little flashbacks to reframe what you'd seen before - think Fight Club, The Usual Suspects, or Red Sparrow - fine for those kinds of films, where the writer is saying ""hehe, eh? You Like that?"" to the audience, but NOT a true-story survival film like this! It didn't happen! Its the writer forcing a way to make the dull story be more watchable, but is completely fake and nasty. It made me so angry how contrived it was, and how much it gloated in its own pathetic idea. Unfortunately, and no disrespect to Tami, but the true story really isn't that interesting. The Donald Crowhurst story (watch the film Crowhurst, or The Mercy) is far more interesting for its psychological depth, the inner turmoils of Crowhurst and how his decisions slide into a downward spiral. Here you just have an unfortunate tragedy followed by a few weeks of survival. Its no wonder the writer had to shoe-horn a horrible, fake way of livening up the screentime, giving us two characters rather than the one and endless flashbacks of two dull people flirting around bars at night. When you see the photos of the real people at the end of the film (that inevitable, contrived way of every true story film these days to try and wring a few tears from the audience) you'll immediately realise just how 'off' the film was in its portrayal. Your imagination of how it really was will be a much better movie than the one you just saw. The song that plays to the schmaltzy final scenes of whimsical guffery is such a bad choice, its almost satirical. You'll wish you were watching The Beach, or 147 Hours, heck you'll even wish you were watching Titanic its that bad. If you're 14 years old, you might enjoy it, especially if you enjoyed Me Before You. Anyone else should stay well away. Absolute waste of a trip to the cinema.",Adrift

Look, I realize that this was based on a true story and because of this its human nature to want to rate it highly - I get that.

79,KyleLicht,"Decent Story, Could've Been Better Though",6,15 June 2018,"This was a pretty good and touching film. Throughout, I enjoyed the nonlinear narrative bouncing between post-hurricane and pre-hurricane; although, I hated it at the same time. I love postmodern films and nonlinear storytelling, but the jumping back and forth in time kind of ruined the energy of the film. We know there's a hurricane in the film by reading the description, but showing what happens after the hurricane hits takes away from the suspense of the dangerous journey and makes the hurricane, one it appears, to be a watered-down evil (pun possibly intended). However, the ending was quite beautiful and depressing. Finding that he was a hallucination the entire time was a very good twist and unexpected. It made me choke up a little bit and think ""Wow, they got me good and it hit hard"". This twist made the film ultimately better, more depressing, and gives me more sympathy and respect for the protagonist, especially as this is a real event.
From the beginning (pre-hurricane), there is discussion of hallucinations at sea by Richard. This is a ""big bowl of foreshadowing"" as Deadpool says in ""Deadpool 2"". Throughout, I was waiting for the hallucinations and then when we see the giant boat simply pass by them, I realized this was the hallucination that he was alluding to earlier. I never would've thought that she'd been hallucinating his presence the entire time after the hurricane. This is a story that should be told and ""Adrift"" is the first film about these events. I'm glad I got to learn more about Hurricane Raymond and Oldham's experiences but I wish it were done a little bit better, out of respect for Oldham and other victims of the storm. The majority of the movie felt ""meh"" to me and aside from the twist, the movie was mostly carried by the great acting and few suspenseful moments. Otherwise, the jumbled narrative added to the chaos and confusion of the plot, but became lost at sea with the characters. Memories of the film make me feel seasick as the majority of it is floating around at sea, being tortured by loneliness, and distress. Making the film linear would've created more suspense and intrigue for the film as it's jumbled structure worked against the plot, adding too much ebb and flow between emotions and comprehension. I respect this film and I'm glad it was produced but I want to see this story or event retold in a better way.",Adrift

The trailer gives you 99% of the story and when it's based on a true story, most of us know the ending. Why do we watch then?

I am also deathly afraid of the ocean and I figured the action scenes and overall cinematography would really be incredible to watch. I was right.

83,eparazak,"Adrift sails smoothly, even if it has to overcome some rough patches of water.",7,7 June 2018,"Adrift is a biopic about a couple who leave their home and set sail from the Pacific Ocean in order to get to San Diego. However, they get caught in a really nasty hurricane and get stranded for weeks out at sea as a result.Shailene Woodley is very powerful in this.film. She does a fantastic job with her role as a shipwrecked sailor. I could feel the struggle that Tami goes through to rebuild the ship and try to find some source of help or land, and it's all thanks to her performance. I thought the chemistry with her and Sam Clafin, who played Richard, was fine. While I wasn't very convinced that Tami and Richard were truly a couple for reasons I will go into below, they did the best they could together with what they got.This movie starts out during the direct aftermath of the hurricane, where we see Tami Oldman barely holding onto the ship. The movie cuts to and from her past life starting from when she met Richard until the hurricane strands them both out at sea. Admittedly, this was a distraction when it started out, but I got used to the movie's format. I also do like how the flashbacks and flashforwards connect, and they make more sense if you pay attention to one line of dialogue that was spoken from Richard. There is one moment towards the end that did bother me, and that's when the couple were out during the storm and the movie cuts to the present for a moment and then cuts back to the storm; that's pretty much the only time I really was bothered by the cutaways.My big issue with the film has to be that Tami Oldham and Richard Sharp's relationship didn't work for me. It seemed oddly rushed and unnatural since they only spend approximately 10 minutes until they both rush into the relationship. Given that this movie has a 1 and a half hour runtime, they could've spent more time building the relationship to make it seem more believable.Even with my complaints, Adrift is still smooth sailing, with fantastic acting from Woodley, great cinematography and a pretty intense story, especially during the climax.7/10",Adrift

It developed a combining sequence that culminated in the flashback catching up to actual event and rescue.Particularly touching was the rescue towards the end, in which the rescue ship blew its foghorns to let Tami know it had seen her and was coming to help.This film is testament to the fortitude of the human will to survive.Recommended.",Adrift

The scenery is gorgeous yes, but the actual use of the camera took it to a whole other level. The flashbacks were interwoven perfectly and clearly. The acting was very natural and it was easy to believe that the actors were the characters they were portraying. It's a sweet, kinda old fashioned love story with endearing characters that are living an extrodinary life anyway, before they are put into this life and death struggle. A nice family or date movie.

As I was watching the movie, I found myself forgetting all about it. That's the power of great acting and story telling. The structure of the film was brilliant. Starting with the aftermath of the hurricane and then alternating between the story of Tami and Richard falling in love and building a relationship and the one of them trying to survive worked on many levels. It helped give both stories a sense of time passage while keeping the film moving at great pace. The alternating scenes informed each other. But even more importantly when the two stories converged they did it so perfectly at the moment so precise, the impact was twice as strong. Of course none of this would have worked if the acting weren't so heartbreakingly real. Shailene Woodley made everything Tami felt so vivid and palpable, it was like I felt it with her. She was assisted beautifully by Sam Claflin in what I consider the definition of a great supporting performance. He was given little to work with and some questionable quality lines (which he magically stripped of all cheese). Yet he made Richard a living, breathing human being, so loving and lovable, that when Shailene's Tami was smitten by him, it was impossible not to be smitten along with her and not to feel everything else she felt for him.",Adrift

Very good acting and chemistry. I've never heard of either one of them before this film. 
This is actually a very deep movie about survival and the subtIeties of the plot may not be noticed or appreciated the first time watching this movie- AND will hopefully lead to good conversation afterwards with whomever you watched with. I went in expecting to leave unimpressed and let down as this story has been done many times before with varying degrees of effectiveness. The ending pulls the whole movie together with a gut punch and, for me, the immediate need for a tissue! And then the ah-ha moments of understanding why certain scenes of the movie were, well, the way they were. 
Other reviewers are mentioning full on nudity. We did not see this at all. My husband cannot remember seeing even naked breasts, except for *maybe* in silhouette when she's sitting , back towards us, naked on the boat. So maybe there are two versions as another reviewer alluded to? We did see the 2 hour long version. 
The only lingering question I have is why weren't the sails lowered long before they actually were lowered when they had plenty of warning about the coming

Based on the true story of a young couple caught in the middle of the ocean during Hurricane Raymond, Adrift is told achronologically, which actually helps with the flow of the story, conveniently giving the movie familiar beats and a timely climax where it might not otherwise fit were the story told in order. Woodley and (especially) Claflin are at their best, giving us headstrong and believable characters in the form of Tami and Richard, giving us their story with genuine emotion.

I don't have anything against flashbacks, per se, if there's some point to them, something that adds to the story or the characters. Here it seems like little more than filler, oh, see them falling in love, now they're on the boat, oh, see them falling in love, now they're on the boat, oh, see them falling in love, now they're on the boat. Yeah, I saw it, didn't believe it for a second, but it was there alright. It's hard to say which was worse because every time they went to a flashback scene, I kept thinking, can we get back to the main story, but then they would cut back to the main story and I would think, god this is boring, just go back to the flashbacks. I mean even the main event that capsized the boat, done in flashback, ended up being boring.And then the ending came. Now they're on the boat, now they're on the boat... now only she's on the boat. Guess they're not falling in love any longer. Pathetic. I expect there to be some kind of ""twist"" ending in, well, pretty much every stupid thriller that's done nowadays, but I expect a lot more in something that purports to be a true story. It's not that the ending surprised me in particular; early on, when she kept looking out onto the ocean for him, I kept thinking, shouldn't she really be looking under the water instead? Still I find it to be an offensive cheat both in terms of the story and in terms of execution.In terms of execution, it's a total lie. When she supposedly finds him, clinging to life, she supposedly jumps into the ocean and swims like a hundred yards out through choppy water, grabs him and then has to make a perilous trip back to the boat. End of the movie, that's shown to be completely and utterly false, so what happened, did she swim out to nothing and almost drown for no reason or was she sunbathing the whole time?In terms of the story, it's also a total lie. If he was dead the whole time, why bust him up beyond recognition? Now I know some will argue that meant it was up to her to do everything but she did everything anyway. When the boat first capsizes, she resets the main mast and pumps out the water below without him being around anywhere. After that it's pretty much them sitting around eating peanut butter and slowly dying of thirst. If she needed something to believe in, to cling to, you would think it would make a lot more sense that he would be a lot more healthy, rather than gee, you're slowly dying, I'm slowly dying, hey, we're all slowly dying, I feel so hopeful.The thing is there was a much better and honest way of doing it. If they had already paid the actor and wanted to get some use out of him, why not just be upfront with it from the beginning, that he was dead but she needed to keep him alive in her mind to try and keep going herself? It could have made the flashback device a lot more useful; for example, when she needs to chart a course towards Hawaii, they could have shown a flashback where earlier she didn't know how to do it because she didn't care, yet he showed her anyway because it was important for her to know, because, well, you never knew when something bad might happen; then cut back to the present moment, she isn't sure she can do it, yet him, still having a physical presence on the boat, encourages her that she can do it, as she remembers step by step.Even the annoying love story might have been better. Again she could have had conversations with him on the boat, again he could have had a physical presence, again telling her to keep going, to keep fighting, yet a moment later he fades away and she's left alone again to try and keep fighting alone. Then cut back to a flashback when they were falling in love for the tenth time and you could see how much he meant and would always mean to her, both in terms of the past as well as sustaining her in the present.Either way though I don't care because as I said, I expect a lot more from a movie that says it's a true story. If the story itself isn't interesting enough that you have to resort to that kind of cheat tells me that it probably isn't a story that's worth telling, at least as a movie. It's like watching a biopic of Muhammed Ali and in it, you have Yoda there training him; like I always said, Muhammed Ali's story, yeah, I guess it's kind of interesting, but you know what would really make it interesting, if Yoda was there training him. Or in the movie 127 hours, instead of just one person falling down a ravine and getting his hand stuck between a rock and a hard place, wouldn't it have been way better if like ten people all fell down a ravine and each of them got their hands caught between a rock and a hard place? It would be like, can you believe that ten of us all fell down a ravine at the same time and each of us got our hand caught between a rock and a hard place. They could have laughed about that one for days.",Adrift

Sam is good but didn't have much to do in the movie to talk about worthy. Cinematography is one of the best in recent times I saw in a movie. Richardson captures the beauty and serenity of the ocean as cleverly as he grabs the complexities of Tami's close-up facial movements. Kormakur's directorial work is well above high bars, ably reflected in the structure of the story-line. Especially displays when he mixes the past flashbacks seamless with the current ordeal at the sea. Well done people, you've made a movie worthwhile watching and talking!",Adrift

131,maruugaa,This should've been a documentary not a movie,6,6 June 2018,"The story is based on a true story that happened in the 1980s.
The story is interesting, but doesn't have enough content to be a feature film. At an hour and a half, this movie was obviously stretched out, and it drained from the movie.
If it had been condensed to a 40 minutes(1 hour with commercials) documentary instead of a feature film, I think it would've portrayed the real life incident better, and been of much better quality.
I also dislike Shailene Woodley. I might be biased, because my dislike for her stems from my raging hatred to Divergent, not just the movies but the books as well. Not to mention, she had her nipples poking out in every scene and was just full on nude just for the hell of it in one scene. And I'm not completely against nudity in movies so long as it's relevant to the plot. But it was just distracting in this. Come on, this movie is for women. If any character should've been naked or close to it should've been Sam Claflin. Seriously, there were only 2 men in that whole theater, both dragged there by women.

It starts by showing us a young girl arriving at Haiti (or Tahiti, I don't even remember which shows how forgettable this movie is), we know nothing about her or her past, and we will never find out anything about her throughout the movie. Next scene she meets a guy, then they have a romantic dinner and then suddenly they're sailing around the world together? We don't know anything about the guy either, what they do, what have they done in the past, where do they get the money for traveling from, nothing... Just a bunch of mushy, wannabe romantic scenes, appealing to 15 year old teenage girls. We don't know what places or countries they visit either, but it ranges from desert islands to what I assume are island countries, Fiji, Jamaica, Indonesia, Madagascar, who would know? Definitely not you, dear movie fan, because you won't get any kind of information, just a bunch of random scenes of them visiting random paces. In one of those places they meet an older rich couple who pays them $10k to take their boat back to the USA, ok. They find themselves in the middle of the storm and end up lost at the sea, so what do they do? Do they find a new way to purify water, improvise, fish, try to fix the radio, do ANY thing you would normally see in a survival movie? No they don't, instead they eat peanut butter, smear their faces with anti aging cream, drink alcohol and smoke Cuban cigars, and keep being mushy through a bunch of wannabe romantic scenes. That's right. The only ""survival"" thing was done in this movie was a scene where the girl uses a duct tape to fix the hole on the side of the boat so that it doesn't sink.

But there's something about this one that just seems to make it drag without engagng us. The idea of using flashbacks to tell the story is excellent, but the chemistry between the two leads seems to be lacking in the flashbacks and, as others pointed out, the script seems, well, too scripted. The actors seem too stiff, almost as if they're reading from a script.

Centered around uninteresting people and their uninteresting relationship, this movie gets its audience from start to finish with the suspense of drying paint. To be fair, there are parts of Adrift that are surprisingly refreshing: an interesting plot development, a quality closing shot (pre-unnecessary epilogue) and immersive sound throughout the scenes on water. However, these refreshing moments are like islands dotting a vast ocean of mediocre romance.Fundamental aspects of Adrift (such as dialogue and editing) are conducted in such obtuse and formulaic fashions that the film is doomed to be forgettable. Because its emotional connections never truly hit its viewers, the direction of Adrift lands somewhere between clumsy and inept. The sequence of scenes is arbitrary, the relationships are underdeveloped, and the clashing special effects undercut the tension. Adrift does make occasionally good efforts but, overall, it's washed up.Writing: 4/10

157,brennandube,"Adrift: Mediocre at best, Woodley does her job",6,22 June 2018,"'Adrift' stars Shailene Woodley and Sam Claflin. It is directed by Baltasar Kormakur who also directed 'Everest' which came out in 2015. This film is as previously stated a true story and follows the story of two avid sailors, Tami Oldham and Richard Sharp. With being a true story of course there are potential handcuffs on filmmakers in regards to what they can and cannot do, but overall 'Adrift' offers movie goers a simple to follow lost at sea type film. The movie opens directly from the moments following the storm and it uses flashbacks to help carry the story along. From the get go I saw straight through the relationship that was brewing between Claflin and Woodley. This has much to do with the script and dialogue provided as I found it to be dumbed down and quite clichéd. Woodley and Claflin offer average to well done performances that are otherwise dampened by a weak dialogue. The fact that for the majority of the film these characters are either isolated alone on the boat or just alone on land makes us as viewers only really have two characters to follow. It is rather difficult to legitimately make a movie that only follows two people with absolutely no supporting cast, but Woodley and Claflin made it passable in 'Adrift.'  The visuals and cinematography in this film are really well done. There are some absolutely gorgeous shots of the ocean and horizon that clearly had proper execution and make for pleasant scenes and backgrounds on screen. The pace in this movie is also pretty well executed. Director Kormakur ensured that there was a steady flow and there was never really a dull or boring act in this film. The flashes ensured that the story possessed good movement and they also helped to set up the climactic twist. Speaking more on the strengths of this movie, the twist that does occur, while being quick and arguably predictable, does have good shock factor that really helps to play on your emotions. Although as an entirety, emotions and a strong sense of connection with these characters is sometimes missing from the movie. I mostly blame that on bad writing. It is vital that with these kinds of dramatic romance films that also carry suspense and thrill, that you care for these characters and what they are going through and 'Adrift' didn't do that for me. Due to the fact that these characters' relationship is not all that well built leads this film to lack in terms of intensity and suspense.",Adrift

On the way, they are intercepted by a major hurricane which causes devastation to the yacht and even worse devastation to the lives of the young couple. Unfortunately, although the cinematography is stunning, it has the Wow factor, the movie's format is flashbacks and forwards, back and forward, back and forward, with long passages of romantic onland scenes which dilute the catastrophy at sea rather too much. In truth, although it is based on a true story, because of the nature of the actual events, it had to be loosely based as certain scenes could not be known for sure. Watch it and you will know what I mean. Better still, watch The Perfect Storm (2000) which is based on a true story, another catastrophy at sea, and manages to get across the horror of it all. At least, put it this way, I never want to see it again, I was so disturbed by it.

Young and carefree, Tammy, native to San Diego, arrives in Tahiti where she meets Richard, a Brit. The movie picks up after a Cat-5 hurricane already capsized their boat. No opening credits just straight adrift and in peril. Talk about intense. The movie jumps from post-storm to the how the two met and began their journey. Then continues to tell the pre and post story throughout the film.Everytime Tammy (or Richard) jumped in the Pacific for any number of reasons, the paranoid kept waiting for the ghost of Robert Shaw to reprise his role of Quint and say, ""You go into the cage. Cage go into the water. Shark is in the water. Our shark."" Luckily, spoiler alert, that never happened.Tammy and Richard found themselves with the opportunity to sail an older couple's yacht from the South Pacific to San Diego for the purse of $10,000 plus two first class airline tickets to a destination of their choice. Which, if we're being honest, if this film was directed by Luc Besson or Jerry Bruckheimer, the older couple would have been the villains in the film. They gave a creepy vibe in all 2-3 scenes they were in. Especially the wife. Seemed destined to become a double-agent, setting up our heroes.Back on the boat, as an audience member, one can begin assumptions to how the story will end, but will be impressed with a small plot twist. Real stories like these always drive home the ""where are they now"", which Adrift did followed suit on, as well.

I don't know if this was Woodley's first time producing a film, but it definitely missed the mark. There's nothing exciting or interesting that happens in particular. The mediocre soundtrack can't make you care anymore about the character's and it's a relief when the storm scene finally is shown. I'm glad with movie pass I didn't have to pay to waste 2 hours of my life.",Adrift

Between the surprising twists (that I won't mention because they would be spoilers) and the intense action all through the movie I was glued to the screen.

179,chloemichelleashby,Average stuck out at sea movie.,5,18 August 2018,"When the movie started with screaming and craziness at the beginning I thought to myself 'oh god here we go, another over dramatised film with no story.' After a while though, I had realised I was in fact wrong and they were about to skip backwards and forwards to fill in any gaps we have so we feel like we know these people, who are acting on behalf of a true story. It was nice that they did take a lot of time showing us their relationship, beginning too end so we can understand who, why and how.
My opinion on the two lead roles is surprising, for the first half of the film I thought the female had only been cast for her looks to be honest but again, I was wrong. She did a decent job and surpassed my expectations. The main lead, hmm he was very bluh but this might of been mainly due to the script. I don't know if he died in the film or survived, that's how much I cared for his character and after watching his fiancée cry in a boat alone at the end, I had come to the conclusion he was in fact dead. I'll be honest, the film didn't make that clear enough to me in the sense that one minute he was there and the next he was not. I just struggled to care. The issue with these kinds of films is how they have to space out the little they do on the boat in the runtime of an hour and half/two hours, it can be a challenge. So film makers in this genre fill it in with little substance, which is a problem with a film where not much happens. In the case of this film, they did a decent job with trying to fill those spaces with guitar solos, sardines and beer. They had the option of doing this as the boat had these resources, other wise it would have been a lot more of an Open Water style where you literally just see the water and two people for the best part of an hour (I didn't mind Open Water) but it's nice that in this film they try to show survival and what the body and mind goes through when struggling at the worst conditions imaginable. They show the female lead fighting to stay alive, honestly made me feel like I'd hate to be in that situation. I've rated it so low for a number of reasons, one of which I've aleady mention; the long repeated scenes with not much happening. I can't rate any film high that nearly sends me to sleep, disliked Gravity for this same reason. I like stuck out at sea films, don't get me wrong but I believe this isn't ground breaking stuff and can be easily repeated by following directors. I would like it if they did a film based on the true story of one of these big ships that went missing with loads of people on it, bermuda triangle style? I don't know if this would work but I'm putting it out there. So yes this film wasn't terrible, if you like your sea films then it's worth a watch to pass the time but I don't think I'll be rewatching it any time soon.5/10",Adrift

Also the storm scenes are well shot and convincingly scary and.... well unfortunately that's it.Shailene Woodley is not a bad actress and she's a producer on this too but the scene-setting romance in this movie is just plain embarassing. It's like it was lifted from a bad teen romcom. The whirlwind romance between the two leads is utterly unconvincing so when it comes to the survival part of the movie they are just not credible.The film is awkwardly structured in a way that jumps back and forth in a short timeline. There was no real need do do this and it just makes the drama more disjointed and reduces the tension.

Plot summary- Story is about Richard and Tami who were stuck in a hurricane on their way to the American coastline, how they were wrecked completely by the disaster leading to Tami finding her way out on the basis of her hallucinations.5. Events- I think since the movie is based on a true story, it is quite commendable to how she survived around 40 days adrift. The movie projection of the storyline was good but should be more endearing for the audiences to connect on different levels. Woodley did a great job of escalating the proficiency of the character to certain level in the movie. 6. Film making- I think the movie was visually sound and quite well on cinematic effects, but that simply reminds me of award winning Life of Pi.7. Potential viewers- I think to all those people who love real life stories or true experiences connotation in a cinematic experience.8.

Despite this, however, the movie was ruined for me due to one simple, yet easily preventable factor: the main characters were not sufficiently developed, rendering me largely indifferent towards the film's drama. Both protagonists only develop as characters through their interactions with one another (that is to say that the only part about either character's lives the audience witnesses is their relationship), thereby only allowing the audience to understand the characters through their interactions with one another, a fact which severely limits the audience's (or at least my) ability to empathise with them.

It is important to note that this is a true story. Do not wait for major action (apart from the obvious, the great storm), that is not the point of the movie. If you want action go for The Rock's new movie or wait for MI Fallout (I guess)
I, personally, don't understand all those comments about the lack of chemistry between the leads, the terrible flashbacks or the outcome. I believed that the two were in love. I believed that they both had a chance to survive. I was amazed by Shaileine's acting in this movie, and the filming location was also well chosen.
 
Finding out that Richard (Sam Claflin) was just a hallucination, was a great twist, delivered terrifically at the perfect time, it broke my heart and made me cry like a baby, and if the movie was made in any other way, it would have been nothing more than a boring 90something minutes of Tami alone on the boat and duh. 
Love story, storm, guy dead, girl sailing alone the end. 
This way though, the audience was given hope until the very end that they both actually had a chance of surviving and having a happy end, plus they could add a twist. 
Sam Claflin's role, was essential, to portrait that Richard truly was the main reason Tami (Shaileine Woodley) survived, because she was so desperate to save (first of all) his life, that she had gone over and beyond, in order to do so.

My issue is that i really got invested in these characters and at the end it is all decided most of these scenes never mattered because they never happened in the first place.Me and my girlfriend where talking afterwards about how we didn't feel taking serious as audience members because the writer decided 70% of the movie just didn't take place.

 I saw the movie at the cinema and I have to say that the whole filming (or edit) was very darksome, not a lot of light in the shots (I'm not talking about the storm scene, which, by the way, was not a bad one, but still not impressive.)

I think Sam and Shailene did their best based on the script they had, so I'm not gonna say something bad about them. Waste of talent and time for them I guess.
 
 The whole story feels unreal, and not in a good way. I think that the female part is exaggerated by the script, while she didn't have a mental breakdown; no anxiety, no panic. Your boat crack, sure, let's repair it right away like nothing happened. I don't know the undertones of the real story, but the Hollywood forgot about them for sure. It's just doesn't feel good.",Adrift

Could have been a good movie because it has great cinematography and beautiful sceneries. But ""Tammy"" (or Tammie) also reminds me too much of Hanna from Bravo Network's ""Below Deck"" and she's so annoying. Anyway, my point is that the use of ""flashbacks"" were overly abused and dramatically decayed the quality of what could have been a great movie.",Adrift
235,medemamax,"Sad, Inspiring, Impressive and Long",6,3 December 2020,"Incredibly well done. The plot was a little slow
and stretched out for my taste and a tad anti-climatic, but I understand there isn't much room for rewriting scenes that didn't happen seeing as this is based on a true story. Shalliene's acting is INCREDIBLE. I never once doubted her performance and while I'm not a fan of her other characters she nailed this one. You relate and feel to her character, and if it wasn't for the plot I would've loved this even more. The plot feels long and arduous, and while I like the story telling of switching between last and present, it gets old and really isn't necessary. It's a great survival movie and some scenes are incredibly well shot, especially when considering they're on a water set for the majority of the film. With that being said, it's not going to be your favorite film. It's inspiring but not a lot happens after the initial shock of being stranded, and while their survival is impressive the film doesn't do much to stress any danger or urgency, leaving the audience saying, ""Wow... That must suck."" Not my favorite and I probably won't watch it again, but the cinematography, writing, and overall production is incredible, especially when considering the lead actress was in charge for most of it. I look forward to seeing other projects by this team, but I don't need to rewatch this one again. :)",Adrift

Starring (in order of frequency of appearance): Shailene Woodley's nipples, Shailene Woodley, and Sam Claflin.I actually felt like a voyeuristic creep watching this. The director has taken every opportunity to ogle Woodley's body with the camera. It's full on creepy. For example, she wakes up to find herself on a capsized yacht, possibly sinking. The first thing she does is take off her life jacket in order to provide a clear view of her nipples through her wet shirt. At other times, the camera is awkwardly positioned to allow for maximum leering, such as between her legs when she swims, and below and behind her when she is sitting in just underwear.Apart from this, the film is quite bland and emotionless. There is no sense of danger or anxiety. It just trundles along from one nipple shot to the next, before she is rescued. Ho hum.",Adrift

I typically love movies based on true stories because life is challenging, inspiring, and sometimes crazier than what we can make up. This movie bombed a great opportunity to tell a very inspiring story. Shailene Woodley was annoying off the charts and the writing was just stupid at times (lots of unrealistic behavior and dialogue during the dating scenes), Jeffrey Thomas unfortunately was super creepy, and I had to keep reminding myself that the story was not about him turning out to be a serial killer. Honestly, by the time stuff got real bad on the boat I just didn't care. Just poor casting, poor writing, and lacking in the depth it should have been focused on instead. When they showed the real woman at the end, it seemed very obvious to me she was a no-nonsense kind of gal and not at all like Woodley portrayed her.

Filming in a tank or at sea is probably the most difficult movie making out there. Shailene Woodley and Sam Claflin I thought were well matched together. For Shailene Woodley I thought this was her ""Monster"" from 2003 with Charlize Theron. This film I believe shows that Shailene has some real thespian muscle. She portrayed a capable sailor at 24 years old without that much experience at the time under her belt. It is wonderful to see film about the human spirit and not be overloaded with special effects, Tami Ashcroft has more grit than most and fair winds to her today.",Adrift

Remember it was 1983, you would hardly have a satellite Magnavox Navigator, too expensive and prone to all sorts of errors and failures.
Weather predictions? At best with pilot charts and percentage predictions at the determined date of journey.
I also became adept with a sextant, declination tables and nautical almanac. I used the sextant only at daytime with no scope and the sun. Shooting at stars was almost impossible and much less with a scope unless you would be standing on a solid platform.
I always commented to friends and people that asked that sailing, was complete and totally insane for a lot of individuals, at daytime all is great, night arrives and faces becoming serious and concerned. If the weather permits all is great, if you're into a bumpy ride, no one returns again, except the ones with ""the right stuff""
The theory at the time was storm sail and heaving to. Today you drop a suitable Drogue and run the following seas no sails at all ""bare pole""

I do have to say that I really enjoy movies about true stories. Therefore, I might be a little biased in that regard. But with that said, I used three words to describe this movie, gripping, courageous and suspenseful. I had no issue with the flash backs. I found it easy to follow and know where you are in the timeline and I have to admit other time jumping movies sometimes confuse me. I did not notice the lack of chemistry that others mentioned between to two main actors but that is probably because I focused on other aspects of the movie. As for Woodley, I normally think her characters mope a lot. However in this movie I did not get that same vibe. In my full review I said this movie was a combination of The Notebook and the Perfect Storm. It wasn't until I was done recording that I realized it was close to a modern day Titanic.

There were twists and turns and the acting was....powerful.Both Sam and Shailene were great, but Shailene Woodley truly shined here. As a fan, I can honestly say this is her best and most powerful performance to date. I just watched in awe thinking ""where did she get the emotional strength to convey this scene in this way?"".......Honestly, her portrayal here was Oscar worthy and I don't say that lightly.

The actors - mediocre acting , shallow and stiff. 
The story was good and well written. A consequence of it being based on a true tale. It seemed fairly factual.
It is worth watching even if only to understand how and why this disaster happened in the first place.
It really showed what can happen at sea when inexperience and poor planning are involved.
I think this should be explained a little here, as many people like to watch sailing movies, as do I, however movies like this only help to discourage people from taking up the wonderful world of sailing.
Let me explain. 
They took off on a long voyage in an unfamiliar vessel. Just one week to prepare. No idea of how much or where the food and supplies were held on board. They neglected to fill the water tanks, ( empty just after a short time at sea ) It seems no ships inventory was gathered or given to them. They seemed not to monitor the weather conditions until far too late. They knew a storm was very close and the winds were already high, but failed to reduce sail until the storm was upon them - far too late, .... ( Spoiler Alert ... this led to the captain being washed overboard and lost at sea) . Did the vessel have a sea anchor, guess they did not know as they seemed to know very little else about the boat, apart from putting up sails and ""being in love"". 
Always remember the 5 P's. This was a disaster waiting to happen. 
The young and inexperience Tami Oldham was the real hero here. Spoiler Alert here,,,,( What she did to survive was exceptional for a young woman and she really deserves credit for her ability under these circumstances. At the end of the movie it says she is still sailing today, I'm sure she is now a seasoned sailor who knows how to properly prepare for a voyage. Please don't let this movie discourage you from taking up sailing, it is a truly wonderful experience and can be very safe and enjoyable.

The storyline held my interest and the love they shared really came through. Be prepared to cry, because it is very sad , the loss of their love and the way she tried to save him.",Adrift

301,mazurkiewiczmandy,"great actors, great story, great movie",9,3 March 2019,"Shailene Woodley and Sam Claflin, I'm not gonna lie, are really the reason why I whatched this movie in the first place. So obviously, yes, I think they were great. I dived into it without watching the trailer and God that was a great idea. The story is amazing but the way it is put in this movie is just splendid. The movie takes your breath away right at the beginning and it doesn't loosen your attention until the very end. I love movies with flashbacks where you only figure out how it actually is at the end, well, this is that kind of movie! I felt the love, I felt the fear and cried all my tears out. Very very much happy I watched this one.",Adrift
