0,MartinHafer,a bit of a disappointment after seeing Shaolin Soccer,8,28 March 2006,"I really think if I hadn't first seen SHAOLIN SOCCER (also starring and directed by Stephen Chow), I would have enjoyed this movie a little more. That's because although there are some funny and very surrealistic moments, the level of humor and the great storyline from this film is a definite step down. However, on its own, it's still a cute and engaging film--with the most ridiculous kung fu action that makes this a minor parody of the genre. Of all the aspects of the film, the music, special effects and action are top-notch. The story line itself, is the weakest point--with a plot that seems to meander and perhaps be a little ""pieced together"" looking. That's because characters often rapidly change into totally different characters--almost like there has been a re-write mid-movie.Overall, worth watching though not exactly the brilliant film its predecessor, SHAOLIN SOCCER was. However it still is superior to such kung fu parodies as THEY CALL ME BRUCE and KUNG POW: ENTER THE FIST.",Kung Fu Hustle
1,Leofwine_draca,Anything-goes style madcap comedy,7,14 August 2016,"KUNG FU HUSTLE is Stephen Chow's comedic follow-up to SHAOLIN SOCCER and enjoyed a massive success around the world on first release. I'm sorry to say that I didn't enjoy it as much as SHAOLIN SOCCER; this is a slightly weaker film with an over-reliance on silly CGI effects and a sometimes boring, meandering plot line that refuses to give the viewer any character to really root for. This time around, Chow – who directed as well as acted – is an unappealing lowlife criminal for most of the plot, before turning into an obvious Neo impersonator for the climax, which heavily rips off THE MATRIX RELOADED.Unlike SHAOLIN SOCCER, there are no obvious good guys or bad guys, instead most of the characters are ruthless or selfish or get what they deserve. Chow is unlikeable, his fat buddy barely gets a look in, and while the kung fu-fighting landlady is supposed to be a character that viewers love and find hilarious, I'm afraid she didn't impress me for a second. Better is Yuen Wah, better known as the baddie in DRAGONS FOREVER, enjoying a fine new taste of cinematic success after languishing in the doldrums for a decade. Wah, who doesn't seem to have aged at all since his bad guy days, is a brilliant fighter and a good actor to boot and I wish he had more screen time.Elements of the film are obvious from SHAOLIN SOCCER – indeed, some of them haven't changed at all, like the tacked-on romance with the mute girl. There's also a ton of the special effects work we saw in the football flick, except it's not novel here anymore, and it's overused throughout. When most of the fight scenes rely on crazy effects, you know you're in trouble. Pretty much all the attempts at humour fall flat – watching characters race at impossible speeds through the countryside, like they're in a Disney cartoon, just doesn't work for me. The script is limited and the fact that there are too many different characters means it's impossible to focus your attention on any one bit. Instead this is a mish-mash of old jokes, new tricks and one too many MATRIX jokes which don't really seem to understand what parody means – simply repeating scenes we saw in the Hollywood blockbusters isn't funny.The other good thing in the film – aside from Yuen Wah – is the bad guy, The Beast, played by Siu-Lung Leung, better known as the '70s Bruce Lee impersonator, Bruce Liang, who appeared in the likes of MAGNIFICENT BODYGUARDS. Leung – who hasn't acted in twenty years – has a ball as the supreme bad guy and he's impossible to dislike. Elsewhere, while the plethora of fight scenes are always entertaining, making this a film to be enjoyed despite the myriad flaws.",Kung Fu Hustle
2,SnoopyStyle,Fun broad comedy,7,5 August 2014,"The city is ruled by the violent Axe Gang led by the sadistic Brother Sum. Only poverty stricken slums like Pig Sty Alley escape their notice. The place is run by bossy couple landlords. Sing and Bone come into the neighborhood pretending to be part of the Axe Gang. Bone is asleep and Sing is a weakling who can't threaten a child. The real Axe Gang happens to be walking by and it's an all out fight. However, it turns out that there are actually kung fu masters among the poor.Stephen Chow directs, writes, and stars in this slapstick comedy. It's wacky, stupid, and hilarious. It's a fun use of CGI. It's a simple rogue finding redemption story wallowing in the silliness of the kung fu genre. This is about the silly humor and kung fu action. I love the silly broad humor. I like the wild kung fu action but there may be a little too much of it. After a visually imaginative and engaging opening, it loses a bit of steam but it always picks up whenever it goes back to the Alley. I wish this movie spends all of its time with the weird cast of characters in the Alley.",Kung Fu Hustle
3,kosmasp,Another World,8,18 May 2007,"This movie is a pure fun ride. It doesn't take itself seriously and stays true to that throughout. So don't watch the movie, if you want a movie with a philosophical background. You will be disappointed for nothing! Although it is an Eastern movie, it does also resemble a Hollywood kind of flair as well. The special effects, the thin characters and so fourth. Or some innuendos or homages if you will, like a scene that will have Road Runner/Wile E. Coyote fans on their toes! Of course there is much more here than that. And the other comic likeness you get here, could also be a manga/anime similarity! And I wouldn't be surprised if the whole thing was based on a manga (japanese comic book, editor's note) to be true! :o)",Kung Fu Hustle
4,classicsoncall,"""He was so dedicated to kung-fu, he went crazy""!",8,25 August 2010,"Well if you, like me, enjoy these flicks where it's possible for one good guy to kick the be-jeezus out of a hundred bad guys all at once, then this is the one for you. Not only that, but it's got just enough non-sensical dialog to seem brilliant. Stuff like ""The good cannot co-exist with the bad, you can't escape your destiny"". Then there's the one lifted right from Stan Lee's Spider-Man - 'In great power lies great responsibility'. Come on, that one should have been attributed to the web slinger. I can't really say though, if you've seen one kung-fu film you've seen them all. This one goes for laughs along with it's action, and it hooks you right from the start with that rhythmic Axe Gang dance - very cool. There's some other original stuff here too (at least for me, I don't watch a lot of martial art movies), like the lion's roar amplified through a makeshift speaker, and the Beast's use of the Toad Style from the Kwan Lun School. Flaming Buddhist Palm also looked pretty interesting; I might have to try that some time.Best move of the picture - The Beast stops the bullet to his head with the two finger technique - ""In the world of kung-fu, speed defines the winner"". My favorite scene, just for the surreal beauty of it, was Sing (Stephen Chow) threatening Ice Cream Girl under the 'Top Hat' poster. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers would have been great in a karate flick, don't you think?As Twelve Kicks, Iron Fist and The Hexagon Staff would attest - ""It's no crime to be good at kung-fu"". But the best line of the picture epitomizes Sing - ""I was studying to be a doctor or lawyer, but this was world peace""! And so the world would be saved once again. Or at least the world consisting of Pig Sty Alley.",Kung Fu Hustle
5,lee_eisenberg,absolutely awesome,10,19 June 2005,"In recent years, the American assumption about Hong Kong cinema seems to be that their movies consist of chop-socky wackiness. In that respect, ""Kung Fu Hustle"" does not disappoint. It tells the story of the Axe Gang, who rule 1940s Hong Kong mafia-style. One of their members is Sing (director Stephen Chow), who joined them because, as he puts it, when he was young, he wanted to be a good guy, but found out that it was easier to be a bad guy. Anyway, the Axe Gang descends on a slum known as Pig Sty Alley, which hides some treasures. But of course, the people who live there aren't going to let the Axe Gang run roughshod over them. From that point on, the movie becomes a cross between Bruce Lee and Chris Farley, especially with the harp-playing scene.Stephen Chow is clearly showing himself to be quite a director, with this movie and with ""Shaolin Soccer"". Admittedly, ""Kung Fu Hustle"" is not any kind of masterpiece; as far as I can tell, it exists for the sole purpose of entertainment. But let's face it, that's the case with most martial arts movies (you might recall that ""Enter the Dragon"" really had no reason for existence except to show off Bruce Lee's impressive skills). There is one scene in this movie where Pig Sty Alley's landlady (Qiu Yuen) chases one of the gangsters in what appears to be a spoof of/homage to the Road Runner-Wile E. Coyote cartoons. 100% cool.",Kung Fu Hustle
6,jboothmillard,Kung Fu Hustle,8,19 June 2008,"Like Hero, House of Flying Daggers and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon this film has the spectacular (and slightly ridiculous) visuals as key, but unlike them, director/writer/star Stephen Chow uses them for comedy purposes, and does so very well. Set in the 1940s, a town in China is ruled by the Axe Gang, and Sing (Chow) desperately wants to become a member. He stumbles into a slum ruled by eccentric landlords, who turn out to be disguised kung-fu masters. Sing's actions eventually causes the explosive kung-fu battle between the Axe Gang and slumlords. Only one side will win, and only one hero will emerge as the greatest kung-fu master of all. Also starring Wah Yuen as Landlord, Leung Siu-Lung as The Beast, Zhi Hua Dong as Donut, Chi Ling Chiu as Tailor, Yu Xing as Coolie, Chan Kwok-Kwan as Brother Sum, Chi Chung Lam, or Lam Tze Chung as Bone - Sing's Sidekick and Xiaogang Feng as Crocodile Gang Boss. The visuals mostly are what made me laugh a lot, including a running chase sequence with cartoon sound effects (probably inspired from Road Runner), and the battle sequences are fun to watch too, a good action comedy. It was nominated the BAFTA and Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. Very good!",Kung Fu Hustle
7,Tweekums,Kung Fu Hustle,8,22 November 2017,"This action comedy from Hong Kong is set in the thirties and gangs, particularly the Axe Gang dominate. Usually such gangs ignore the poor as they have nothing worth stealing and no money to extort. That changes when two wannabe gangsters, Sing and his friend Bone, start trying to intimidate the poor inhabitants of Pig Sty Alley while claiming to be members of the Axe Gang. It is immediately obvious that they have picked on the wrong neighbourhood and they are chased off. Soon the real Axe Gang turn up hoping repair damage to their reputation; they don't know there are many old martial arts masters living there and they too are beaten. After that they bring in assassins; including The Beast; reportedly the most dangerous man in the world! By now Sing is with the gang but will he remain with them or will he become the protector of the helpless he dreamt of being as a child?If you like your kung fu action to feel at least a little bit realistic you might be disappointed but if you want a good laugh and really over-the-top action then this film is a delight. The action is a mix of standard, 'slightly exaggerated' martial arts, kung fu that is more like a superpower and a ridiculously sped up chase. The characters are a lot of fun; most notably the landlady and her husband, Sing and The Beast. The cast does a solid job; the situations may be comic and the characters over the top but they are played straighter than one might expect. Most of the comedy worked for me, although I must admit the speeded up chase was a little too silly for my taste. There are also quite a few references to other films such as 'The Shining' and 'The Matrix'. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody who likes good slapstick comedy combined with exciting martial arts action.",Kung Fu Hustle
8,ma-cortes,"Comedy, martial art action and lots of fun with a splendid Stephen Chow",7,17 July 2007,"This amusing film deals about a a pair small delinquents named Sing(Stephen Chow) and his sidekick Bone(Chun) in Shanghai during the 1940s.Sing wishes unite with Axe gang led by heinous criminal Brother Sun(Chan).A slum named Pig Sty Alley is the solely location where the Axes band don't extort but the inhabitants are hapless and poor.The slum is ruled by a loud-mouthed landlady(Qiu Yen) with an apparently feeble husband.The wannabe mobsters,Sing and Bone,attempt swindle a barber when the authentic Axe gangster appear in Pig slum.Them,it results to be that various Kung Fu experts with breathtaking strength are living into slum and an incredible fighting take place.The Axes gang leader contract a magician violinists fighters and an obnoxious assassin which break out from the prison for eliminate the slum rebels.And Sing spontaneously decides save the day,turning a extraordinary transformation.This entertaining film displays noisy action,slapstick comedy,tongue in check,spectacular martial art struggles and is pretty bemusing.Stephen Chow- combining his facet of actor and director-introduce his comedy talent and hilarious moments here and there,developing his trademark,creating parodies along with hard-hitting Kung-Fu scenes.He frequently utilizes Chinese name ¨Sing¨ in his films.Stephen Chow collaborated with another legendary Kung Fu choreographer,Yuen Wo Ping,famous since '70's for his Hong Kong movies and nowadays working in Hollywood(Matrix ,among others).The overwhelming fighting and sensational action scenes are made by cables and wires and by computer generator,as well.Besides appear,one of the most notorious experts, Sammo Hung(Martial law) as additional action choreographer.The supporting cast is frankly magnificent,special mention for Qiu Yen,as the landlady,she apprenticed Chinese martial art and Beijing-opera skills with Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung under the same master in her younger days and played as a girl wrestler saving Roger Moore in Bond 007¨The man with the golden gun(1974)¨,in order to add fat for the picture,she took a Japanese sumo fighter's diet(like Renée Zeelweger for Bridget Jones).The motion picture is produced by Columbia Pictures Production Asia,Beijing film studio and China film group.Chow's creativity into comedy and Kung Fu action had been demonstrated with the successful¨Shaolin soccer¨,now with ¨Kung Fu¨going on to amuse viewers around the world .He's recently shooting the following the sequel with similar actors.",Kung Fu Hustle
9,BA_Harrison,"What now, Stephen Chow?",6,6 February 2009,"Comedy doesn't always travel well, and I admit that many supposedly-funny foreign moviesparticularly those from Chinahave left me scratching my head in confusion. However, being a fan of some of Stephen Chow's earlier work, and with Kung Fu Hustle receiving praise in the West from practically all who have clapped eyes on it, I expected this film to have me laughing uncontrollably from start to finish.Unfortunately, it didn't, partly because much of Kung Fu Hustle's comedy is based on stale, decades-old routines 'borrowed' from Hollywood's silent comedians and Looney Tunes cartoons, and partly due to the fact that I just didn't understand some of the humour (which I'm guessing is based on cultural references that I am just plain unaware of).The film also failed to impress me with its martial arts scenes, which have been choreographed to within an inch of their lives by wire-fu expert Yuen Wo-Ping, and then further meddled with by digital artists. The result is extremely cartoonish, and bound to disappoint those who, like me, prefer their fight action to be as bone-crunchingly realistic as possible (Yuen Wah, one of my favourite kung fu stars, is completely wasted).As far as I am concerned, Kung Fu Hustle works best when it enters the realms of pure fantasy, such as the scene when three fighters do battle with a pair of evil assassins armed with a magical musical weapon, or the bit when when one character uses her incredible vocal powers to defeat the enemy; it is these visionary moments that are the most entertaining parts of the film, and if there had been more of this kind of stuff and less in the way of silly slapstick, I'd be rating this film a lot higher.",Kung Fu Hustle
10,paul_haakonsen,Do the hustle... Kung Fu Hustle...,7,30 December 2018,"""Kung Fu Hustle"" (aka ""Kung Fu"") is actually the type of martial arts comedy that you can watch again and again. It is very reminiscent of the numerous, and enjoyable, Jackie Chan movies in spirit. And that is solely because it is Stephen Chow that is at the helm, because he is every bit as good and funny as Jackie Chan, just haven't achieved half the fame outside Asia unfortunately.The story told in ""Kung Fu Hustle"" is good, it is funny and it is fully and wholeheartedly entertaining. There are so many aspects to the movie that it is hard for anyone not to find something to like here, ranging from characters, places, events and such.""Kung Fu Hustle"" is crammed with a great cast, whom all performed remarkably well with their each individual role and character. The movie is definitely superbly carried by the director and star himself, Stephen Chow.The characters in the movie are half the movie, because they are all so very interesting and colorful. Almost every character comes with a good backstory that lets you delve deeper in to the character. And the character progression throughout the movie is definitely good as well.There is a heap of action in the entire movie, and the choreography is really good. Everything is fast paced and well executed on the screen, making it all look phenomenally well on the screen.If you haven't already seen ""Kung Fu Hustle"", you should jump at the chance when you are given, because this is definitely a remarkable movie. Lots of action and fun, something for everyone.",Kung Fu Hustle
11,Quinoa1984,"about as fun as it sounds, though know what you're getting if you're a ""serious"" martial arts movie fan",8,8 October 2006,"I was talking with a friend of mine, much more into martial arts movie than me, who didn't like Kung-Fu Hustle because of the way it went about showing the fights, and even for its goofy humor being too broad. While I could understand the latter part- everyone's got their own sense of humor (unless if someone's got none, which is dangerous)- the former puzzled me. What does someone expect, for example, after seeing the trailer? If anything, director Stephen Chow is successful most in making a decidedly non-serious martial arts movie. It almost reminds me of my youth seeing the Ninja Turtles fight- there too was martial arts, sometimes with well choreographed sequences with real martial-arts fighters fighting in the costumes. But, like that, Kung-Fu Hustle gets it right in being completely unpretentious entertainment. It's a comedy in the tradition of vaudeville and Looney Tunes, with specks of Tarantino, the Marx Brothers (yes, also vaudeville, but on a different plane), and with characters that are left to be, of course, cartoonish, but not characters that are too cruel or unlikeable either.Take the landlady of the establishment that the bulk of the picture takes place. She's played by Wah Yuen as the ultimate bad-ass lady you don't want to mess with on the wrong beat. Namely because of her look, which is that of having been going too long at what she does to take any lip or disruption for her customers. But then when trouble comes her way, she then reveals herself as a screaming force to be reckoned with. And all the while it's done with a wink to the audience, but taken seriously in its own comic-book logic. Chow also acts in the film as well as co-writing it, as Sing, someone who wants to join up with the mob 'the Axe gang', but doesn't quite cut it- at least at first it seems. In the midst of this is a romantic sub-plot involving a girl he once knew whom he had to leave behind, and when this is rekindled it strikes up some extra ambivalence, and a little strife between him and his best friend (Bone, played as a deadpan idiot by Chi Chung Lam). This all leads up to a show-stopping finale where Sing finally has to step up to a certain gargantuan challenge against his evil opponent.It's not necessarily a great comedy, as sometimes it starts to show how goofiness can backfire in a couple of scenes. Plus the romantic sub-plot, while very knowing of its own satirical place from kung-fu movies past, is still a little unnecessary at times. But overall it's the kind of film that I would recommend to non kung-fu movie fans; if you're expecting a work that takes its fights and stunts seriously like my friend did, look elsewhere. But if you want something that takes a grab-bag of ideas and tosses them altogether to become something original, this is the comedy to check out. It's visual effects go along with the tone of the comedy at most times, like a super-fast chase down a road by two of the characters. And even more ""serious"" fights like the one between the landlady and her husband against the Ax-thugs at night, still has that air of a battered, supernatural martial-arts tongue placed firmly in cheek. It is, for lack of a better critical term, a gas practically from start to finish.",Kung Fu Hustle
12,hitchcockthelegend,"Quite an experience, and in a great way as well !.",9,8 April 2008,"Went into this one totally blind as to its contents, truth is, is that i was mooching round the shops yesterday and came across an Asian triple pack DVD at a bargain price, since one of the films was Jet Li starrer Unleashed, i thought it was worth the cheap price on offer. Got home and the write up on the back of the case didn't give much away as regards plot for Kung Fu Hustle, an Axe Gang, some guy named Sing wants to be in the gang, and that some creaky old residents in a place called Pig Sty Ally are tougher than they look.What i got was what i can only describe as a live cartoon full of class and style, the sort of flip side to the more arty Asian films that have {rightly} become massively popular in this present decade. Written, directed, produced and starring Stephen Chow {Sing}, Kung Fu Hustle is a remarkably breathless piece of work, the plot is threadbare for sure, but it really matters not, because Chow has fused the grand old genre staple punch up with balletic comedy, it's quite something to behold. It's as loud as a face off between Motorhead & Iron Maiden, yet it's just so flipping tender at the same time!. Incredible sequences will dazzle you one moment and then have you laughing the next, i'm quite annoyed that i didn't catch on to this film back in 2004, but even now some 4 years later this film is still a breath of fresh air on the silver screen, see it and roll with it, enjoy 9/10.",Kung Fu Hustle
13,dbborroughs,Awesome in the truest sense of the word.,10,24 April 2005,"A masterpiece of cinema, Kung Fu Hustle takes everything from everywhere and mixes it up into a new breed of film. This is a film that sets the bar on what can be done to amaze us at a new level. Its not all amazing visuals but great story telling as well, something that will probably allow this film to live on for the next hundred years.The film has been compared to a Looney Tunes version of a Quentin Tarantino film, and while its partly true, it has to be remembered that Tarantino has been raiding the work of filmmakers like Stephen Chow for years and telling people its his own stuff. Here we have the real deal and the action in this blows anything that Tarantino has done, in particular the House of Blue Leaves sequence in Kill Bill, off the map.This is simply a great film.",Kung Fu Hustle
14,view_and_review,Kung Fu Hustle adds a new flavor to the traditional kung fu movie,8,23 February 2007,"Oddly enough, I found this quirky little movie quite appealing. It took me a bit to warm up to the movie, but in the end I liked the non-traditionalist approach to this kung-fu movie. The physical humor and the verbal humor, while not hilarious, was still pretty funny. And I think more than anything, the humor was effective because it came as such a shock and a surprise just because of the timing and the kind of movie it was. But this movie didn't just provide laughs, it also provided some excellent fight sequences. The battles in this movie easily rival some of the top kung fu movies such as ""Iron Monkey"", ""Lord of the Wu-Tang"", and others. There was a perfect blend of true martial arts hand to hand combat, excellent choreography, and a bit of suspended belief weapons use and super ability.The directing and the cinematography was spectacular. There were some wonderfully captured shots that drastically enhanced the movies appearance and overall style. As a martial arts movie fan, I really appreciated this movie's ability to mix humor with some very nice and stylized fighting scenes without making a mockery of itself and other good martial arts films. This movie is a pleasant surprise for any kung fu movie fans.",Kung Fu Hustle
15,evanston_dad,A Kung Fu Blast,8,3 December 2005,"""Kung Fu Hustle"" is ""Kill Bill"" with a healthy dose of Looney Tunes thrown in for good measure. It's a rip off of about a hundred other films, but yet it never feels like a rip off. To Stephen Chow's credit, it feels totally original, and you find yourself as you're watching the movie eagerly waiting for the next bit of insane craziness he's going to throw on to the screen.This movie pokes fun at the earnestness of recent films in the genre, like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" ""Hero,"" and ""House of Flying Daggers."" Nothing is taken seriously here, and thank God for that. This is one bit of nonsense after another, and it's enormously entertaining. Film buffs should have a blast ticking off the homages to other films. The Axe Gang brings to mind the Crazy 88's of ""Kill Bill."" Chow tips his hat to the blood-spurting elevator scene from ""The Shining."" A poster for ""Top Hat"" is prominently displayed in the background of one scene (suggesting that Chow draws inspiration for his dazzling fight choreography from the fancy footwork of Fred and Ginger). And ""The Matrix"" gets its due as well.Chow gives himself a fun character to play, and he's also written a very clever screenplay. Pay careful attention to the early scenes, because clues that you might be tempted to shrug off as just being silly bits of embellishment actually become quite important later on.And lastly, this movie has an awesome soundtrack.Grade: A",Kung Fu Hustle
16,anaconda-40658,Kung Fu Hilarity.,9,5 November 2015,"Kung Fu Hustle (2004): Dir: Stephen Chow / Cast: Stephen Chow, Danny Chan, Yuen Wah, Yuen Qiu, Bruce Leung: Absolutely hilarious martial arts comedy written, directed and starring Stephen Chow. The Axe Gang is the most feared gang in the country and they take aim at the peaceful Pig Sty Alley but are surprised when their peaceful target is skilled in martial arts. Amusing setup travels from one fight scene to the next with a rather merciful conclusion. What really shines are the exquisite visual elements and the humour propelled by the cast. Chow plays Sing who wishes to join the Axe Gang but he is ordered to commit a murder to do so. He reflects upon younger days when standing up for a young girl resulted in his ass getting kicked. He is a wimp with a good heart and Chow plays him to perfect comic pitch. Other characters include the Beast who looks nothing like one. Danny Chan plays the ruthless Axe Gang leader who tests Chow and eventually misuses his control to dire consequences. A landlady, played by Yuen Qiu possesses the ""lion's roar"" and becomes a force to be reckoned with. Yuen Wah plays the landlady's drunken husband with powers of his own. Bruce Leung plays the Beast whose transformation is both nasty and funny. Great mix of martial arts and humour that takes jabs at martial arts films that destroys the law of gravity.

17,Aaron1375,"A movie with good action, comedy and heart.",10,17 August 2005,"When I bought this movie, I was expecting a chuckle or two and to see some pretty good fight scenes. This movie went beyond my expectations and has to be one of the best movies I have seen all year. The comedy had me laughing out loud, the fight scenes were jaw dropping and to top it all off it even had some touching emotional scenes as well. This movie has it all and it comes not from the United States, but rather the far east where they seem to keep making movies that I thoroughly enjoy. This movie has a gang known as the Axe gang terrorizing nearly every corner of the city save for the areas that are poor. That is until an aspiring man who wishes to join the gang literally brings the gang violence to this peaceful little slum town with its many colorful characters, which a few of the residents are kind of well versed in kung fu. We get to see this young man make several stupid mistakes and he seems sort of a klutz, but there also seems to be a hint of greater things. Assassines are sent to deal with those who fought the Axe gang and we get a very strange musical combo and a man who is so well versed in martial arts he is known as the ""Beast"". Great fights ensue, but as for the comedy the best part has to be Sing's (the man who wants to join the Axe gang) assassination attempt of the landlady of the poor town. So if you like Asian cinema and are in the mood for a movie that basically has a lot of laughs and action then this is definitely the one to check out.",Kung Fu Hustle
18,gradyharp,Sergio Leone Meets the Keystone Cops in Canton,8,20 January 2006,"KUNG FU HUSTLE is clearly one of the silliest, funny, genuinely well-produced comedies to come around for a long time. It is so very refreshing to lose yourself in this farce knowing that the entire purpose of the film is to entertain. But as in all good comedy there is also a message.Talented director/writer (with Tsang Kan Cheong)/star Stephen Chow has the whole concept of Kung Fu as entertainment down pat. With the brilliant choreography of Yuen Wo Ping as partner, Chow tells a skeletal tale of two wannabe criminals (Chow himself and his obese sidekick Chi Chung Lam) who will stop at nothing to become members of the Canton mafia Axe Gang. They blunder into a hick town run by a smarmy landlord and his bellicose wife to find someone to kill, as that is the only way they can join the Axe Gang. But this sleepy little town is unafraid of gangs, why? - because they happen to be the home of some expert Kung Fu practitioners. After some absurd events the Axe Gang happens into the town only to come up against impossible odds and a lot of hilarious surprises.The choreography and setting parodies everything in the Hollywood repertoire: the spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leone, High Noon antics, Busby Berkeley type staging, Keystone Cops zany shenanigans, Marital Arts films - name it, the film takes a shot and the shot outdoes the original! The color and cinematography are terrific, the musical score (to which Chow also contributed!) is a little masterwork of ancient Chinese instruments garnished with contemporary sounds, and the actors, when not engaged in the nonstop fighting sequences, just seem to be having the best time being silly. For pure diversion and giggling entertainment, spend an evening in the company of Stephen Chow and crew. Recommended, even for serious movie aficionados! Grady Harp",Kung Fu Hustle
19,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Kungfu Hustle,7,24 December 2004,"I missed the Stephen Chow movies of old, before his forays into the US Market with Shaolin Soccer and now Kungfu Hustle, where his movies were inane, slapstick and filled with witty dialogue that entirely made no sense.But don't misread me, I'm not saying that this flick is no good. There are classic Chow moments, but somehow I feel that they ain't enough. The Kungfu and its effects remind you of The Matrix Trilogy, with its bullet time effects, and even Axe Gang members and fight scenes that resemble the Burly Brawl, no surprise though, as the fight choreographer is Yuen Wo Ping.Character development, like all Chow movies, are zilch and cartoony, and the female lead in this film, although va-va-voom, is classic flower vase material, and she doesn't even say anything, how's that?!

Combine this with the references to American cult movies and you get something edible for the western public. But it's not only this. The action scenes are great, but so are scenes in other movies. What sets this one apart is the choice that the director makes NOT to follow walked paths, be innovative, funny and subtle in the same time. You will find major themes of human stories in this movie, but packed so nicely in unexpected and vision that you end up feeling you've seen a film unlike any other.

This causes a rift between the gang and a group of great Kung-Fu masters disguised as slumlords, with a poor town caught in the fray.While the movie is full of nonsensical comedy and oddball jokes and dialog, this film is still quite entertaining - filled with martial arts action and featuring Kung Fu battles galore that will sure give you an pretty riveting experience. You will also get a touch of philosophy behind the martial art and how Chow interprets it in the movie.Set in Canton, China in the 1940s, the setting and cinematography captured that time-frame beautifully and the visual and special effects were OK for the most part (not too much CGI). The acting was also OK for the most part, despite all the slapstick and goofy humor - Chow did manage to put in a dose of drama and heroism to make the story redeeming and somewhat meaningful.Overall, it is not a bad action-comedy. Fans of crazy and wild Hong Kong Cinema would enjoy this flick immensely.Grade B-",Kung Fu Hustle
22,Buddy-51,"enjoyable, if excessive, martial arts comedy",7,30 June 2006,"The stylish and stylized ""Kung Fu Hustle"" is, as its name implies, a goofy martial arts parody done with rare good humor and a keen sense of the absurd. It is a tale of gangsters and wannabe gangsters going up against a half dozen or so of the finest fighters in the lower class part of town. However, the plot is merely a framing device for a series of amazing fight sequences that showcase not only the performers' incredible skills as stunt men (and women) but the film-making prowess of those behind the camera as well. Writer/director Stephen Chow (who also plays the main role) turns his flesh-and-blood actors into the equivalent of cartoon characters, unaffected by the laws of gravity and physics, as they are stabbed repeatedly, fall from impossible heights, and suffer incredible bodily abuse, only to pick themselves up, dust themselves off, and continue on fighting as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened. The razor sharp editing and multi-speed camera-work - ranging from fast-motion to freeze framing - also contribute immeasurably to the surrealistic tone of the film.It's true that ""Kung Fu Hustle"" is definitely an acquired taste, and to those who are not aficionados of the art form, much of the movie can seem repetitive and silly. And even for the most passionate of devotees, it can still be too much of a good thing. The plot is frequently incoherent and the characters wafer-thin, but the stunning look and extraordinary energy level of the film make it a must-see for die-hard fans of the martial arts.",Kung Fu Hustle

This movie is not nearly as funny nor is it really trying to be as funny - there are slapstick scenes, but the action sequences are, while effective, not as humorous as a typical Jackie Chan fight. I wouldn't describe this as a comedy, but as an action picture with some humor.Also, this film is much more violent than Shaolin Soccer. Yes, it's a very cartoony violence, and for the most part nothing that bothered me, but my girlfriend cringed every time someone's head was bashed through a concrete floor or whatever, so it was way too violent for her.So I did feel guilty and conscious of my girlfriend's discomfort while watching, but aside from that I really think this movie is incredibly overrated. It's a good kung fu movie with comedic elements. It's got some clever ideas and quick moving action, although it's comedy can get a little too over-the-top silly.Just be warned, if you loved Shaolin Soccer that is not a guarantee that you will love this one.",Kung Fu Hustle

As events progress, the one discovers his humanity again and takes on the gang, as well as a new recruit who mastered Kung Fu to such an extent he went insane and ended up in a mental asylum...There's been a regeneration lately of the Kung Fu genre, with the likes of Shaolin Soccer and Ong Bak, and this latest entry tries to spin a comedic twist on it.I found the plot really sloppy and hard to follow (even for such a film.) As for all the breath-taking stunts, in comparison to Ong Bak (which I saw only a short while ago!) they look really unbelievable and strings assisted. The relentless onslaught of them began to wear me down after a bit.

Nor is this necessarily a bad thing; the film has an original streak of humour running through it, and in an an age when a succession of directors have competed with each other to find the inner darkness in Batman, it's maybe not so bad to watch something unashamedly comic-book in nature, with no attempt made to hint at hidden depths.

26,Pjtaylor-96-138044,That's all folks!,6,12 May 2020,"'Kung Fu Hustle (2004)' is about as close to a live-action cartoon as you can get, an energetic cross between 'Looney Tunes' and 'Dragon Ball Z'. Its broad comedy is bolstered by unconventional, special-effects-driven visuals and a fast-paced sense of timing. When it works, it can be a fair amount of fun. Its fight sequences, in particular, are sharply choreographed and nicely edited, by far its most successful aspects. The flick often falls short, though, and doesn't hit the note it's aiming for. Its satirical yet messy story doesn't do a great job of getting you invested in a protagonist, which leads to a generally passive experience. It isn't boring but it isn't hugely engaging, either. Having said that, the thing absolutely works as breezy, zany, 'no thought required' light entertainment. It truly is inventive, even if its inventions only work around fifty percent of the time. 6/10",Kung Fu Hustle
27,dromasca,splendid entertainment,9,15 February 2006,"The best entertainment film of the year up to now comes from a very unexpected source - for me at least. I am no fan of the kung-fu films genre, and I am not sure if I have ever survived such a movie for its whole duration. Certainly, films like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" ""Hero"" and ""House of Flying Daggers"" may be mentioned here, but I do not believe that they belong to the category, they are rather more like historical legends, with the martial arts part of the artistic fabric, same as the camera work or the music.Here we deal with a very different approach. Director Stephen Chow takes the popular entertainment genre of kung fu action and a very basic melodramatic story and immerses it in a sea of fun, creating an extravaganza of color, images, effects and gravity defying ballet. The film is both violent and funny, it has some of the gruesome violence of Terentino and the innocence of the mute comedies at the same time. The supreme master of fight effects Yuen Wo Ping ('Crouching Tiger', 'Matrix', 'Kill Bill') is at his best.Superbe entertainment by any scale.",Kung Fu Hustle

It's not a profound film by any means, but it's a lot of fun. I loved how a lot of the characters were older, not what you'd normally see in a kung fu movie, and cast with legends from the 1970's. It feels like it's full of comic book characters, each with their special powers and moves, but it reflects storytelling from China that goes back centuries (for example, the 14th century epic novel 'Outlaws of the Marsh'). There are also tons of other more obvious references across cultures (e.g. Wile E. Coyote and the Roadrunner, The Shining, Top Hat, and many others).

There's always ways this movie tops itself, adding more insanity to the mix. It's hard to even pick a specific fight scene that was my favorite. We even get some great jokes along the way.

Kung Fu Hustle is one of those few movie that is able to capture the elements of various diverse movie genres and successfully balance them to produce a viable, intact movie experience that an audience can relate to. In the tradition of ""Kill Bill,"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" Kung Fu Hustle brings together elements of the old martial arts movies, the contemporary retro feel of drama and comedy in a way that singes the senses. The blatant, visceral murders and killings along with the slapstick comedy bounces the audience in a tumultuous, emotional cosmic ride while the leading characters are both intriguing, compelling but in their own ways despicable. The eclectic use of special effects along with the uncertainty of who will live or die sets up the movie in a delicious way. There were some disconcerting elements with a few scenes left hanging, the jerky jump between scenes, abrupt that left little time for the audience to react. The tone of the movie shifted between the first third of confusion and disorientation and the last two-thirds of the movie that required the audience to re-mold their perception where the separate threads seem to be tied together (awkwardly, as this was no mystery thriller or detective movie). However, overall, Kung Fu Hustle was one of the best movies to come out in 2004.",Kung Fu Hustle

Not only is the fight choreography impressive, the battles become more insane (in the best possible way) as the movie progresses, with mind-blowing special effects as all concerned perform stunts as if they are Keanu Reeves in 'The Matrix'. It is an incredibly funny film too, with the best moments had by a deadpan Qiu Yuen as the no-nonsense landlady with a gift for speed. Not all of the humour works with some silly stereotype supporting characters, but there is a lot of fun to be had in the wannabe gangster character that director Stephen Chow has written for himself, comically stabbed multiple times by his own knives at one point (!). Throw in a fun reference to 'The Shining' and camera-work that never sits stills and this is a pretty appealing concoction. The character arc of Chow's character leaves a little to be desired, but this a film in which the images reign supreme over the story. There is a delightful weirdness to all the axe-wielding gang members running about in top hats and tuxedos/suits and Qiu Yen's kung fu powers turn her into the very epitome of a moody landlady who you don't want to mess with.",Kung Fu Hustle
33,johnnyboyz,Probably one of the best films in recent memory to come out of the Far East.,8,27 June 2008,"What is there to say about Kung-fu Hustle, apart from it being a post-modern explosion of ideas, references and conventions? Stephen Chow in this film has taken everything we may associate with the kung-fu genre when it comes to large fight scenes and spectacular stunts and has combined it with other ideas by way of the Classical Hollywood musical; 'Americanised' kung-fu films such as The Matrix and Equilibrium; Warner Brothers cartons and has even thrown in a pinch worth of a reference to French animation for the overall narrative. Needless to say, Kung-fu Hustle is a breathless and relentless series of scenes that entertain on one level but also captivate on a more appreciative level as people jump, leap and pirouette through the air in a series of amazing stunts.I'm sure everyone likes to go into a film with the mindset that they will get something out of the picture that they can really enjoy and go away with. Some aim higher than others; some like a lot of action, maybe a standout performance with others looking to appreciate depth-of-field or attention to mise-en-scene. In Kung-fu Hustle, it's difficult to think of anyone who might not get anything out of the film at all. Yes, Kung-fu Hustle is chock full of fight scenes and yes, some may be quick to label it something lower than it is but I think this sort of reaction is somewhat unjust. Hollywood have churned out some really appalling action films in the last couple of years; films like Bulletproof Monk and Charlie's Angles: Full Throttle  films that more resemble computer games aimed at people who play computer games than anything else. But in Kung-fu Hustle, the violence or 'action' has a certain aesthetic to it  it is like watching a dance or a ballet; it is like being in the front row of a large, grand opera with towering sets and a huge casts of extras.One of the reasons I got this feeling is due to the music that plays during one specific scene, in which two resident kung-fu masters battle against two other hooded hit men  their weapon of choice is a string instrument that, with added power of enlightenment, can churn out fists and knifes to counteract their opponents. The music is of a classical and instrumental variety, playing during the fight thus juxtaposing any violence we might think will occur, especially when knifes and blades on the end of sticks are introduced into the arena. But the emphasis is more on the music, the sheer poetic movement of the characters and the slow motion than what weapon they're using and to distract us enough and to 'wow' us enough for us to focus on these things is an achievement in itself.So the film puts across its violence more so as poetry or as one, large dance than a simple action scene with one side over here and one side over there accompanied by nasty rock music (Blade: Trinity, anyone?). Something else the film does during the mentioned scene is include a re-occurring joke, the hardest of all jokes to get right because it is the repetition of the gag that must remain strongest  are people going to laugh more than once at the punch line? One character's constant sapping of another to 'get out of the way' acts as a perfect topping to an already delicious scene. But the film is delicious as a whole. The film is less concerned with actors, characters and story lines and more focused on the expansion of ideas and the updating of recent Hollywood clichés.The character of the Landlady (Yuen) is one of great strength and independence; she is also female. The fight scenes do not exist to merely entertain an attentionspan-less audience but act as a demonstration as to how this can be and should be done, in reply to the American films I mentioned. The story is straight out of the popular French Astérix comics in the sense a much larger organisation or 'gang' (The Romans, the Axe Gang) wants to rule further. To do this, they must take a much smaller area but have trouble doing so. Astérix's village and Pig Sty Alley act as this buffer, both of which house individuals with strength great enough to repel the forces of evil  the character of Sing (Chow himself) will also suffer his epiphany through learning what's right and wrong because of this.Then there are the many references to popular culture through spoofing of Road Runner and such. I see this as Chow and China as a whole spoofing and perhaps attempting to 'ruin' pieces of popular American culture just as America cashed in post-Matrix with an invasion of horrible Hollywood action films such as Bulletproof Monk et al. Kung-fu Hustle takes back the kung-fu genre for China. The film is one about the expansion and globalisation of a lethal group but along with this it pokes fun at the expansion and Americanisation of Kung-fu as a means of disposable entertainment. Big; clever and very cinematic, Kung-fu Hustle is a winner if you're in the mood and even if you're not.",Kung Fu Hustle

35,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"A caricature of a kung fu movie, stylish and silly",7,6 August 2009,"Kung fu producer, director, writer and star Stephen Chow brings a stylized and exaggerated element to ""Kung Fu Hustle"" that undoubtedly reaches out to a Western audience. The film is an homage to decades of kung fu movie history but it embraces CGI and moves beyond traditional fight choreography.In the film a wannabe Chinese gangster played by Chow gets the slum where he lives in trouble with the notorious Axe Gang (think the ""Kill Bill"" Crazy 88s with hatchets) by posing as an Axe Gang member. To fend off the Axe Gang, several villagers from the slum turn out to be kung fu masters, even the fat landlady and her bumbling husband. The Axe Gang retaliates by hiring seasoned killers to take them out.""Kung Fu Hustle"" is comical and action heavy, often times even comically action-heavy. It isn't violent in the ""Kill Bill"" sense, but nearly in the cartoonish sense, with characters chasing each other and their legs gyrating like the Roadrunner. Chow brings that cheesy '70s kung- fu sense of humor and mixes it in with the special effects martial arts of today's era. There's as much slow motion fighting as you'll see in ""The Matrix"" trilogy.Chow is a good director, bringing a variety of skills as both an action and comedy director. He knows how to balance the two to amusing effect. He knows how to surprise us with comedic timing but also exactly what makes us think ""ooh, cool."" Instead of gore, he manages the effect of gruesome violence without showing it by great set up and then cutting away at the last second.Sometimes the style is too forced or the humor too cheesy, but this is a very unique action movie with silly characters from the kung fu tradition, not the glamorous look of films such as ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" and ""Hero."" This is one of those action movies with misfits, not serious heroes with something to prove.Though Chow has yet to follow up ""Kung Fu Hustle,"" he might be talented enough to bridge the Western world with the art of the Chinese (not American) kung fu movie in a way that hasn't been done since Bruce Lee, praying on our love for stylish and glitzy action. With a better budget, the CGI could be done to better effect and even the stunts too.",Kung Fu Hustle
36,funkyfry,Memorable and bizarre action/comedy,8,7 December 2008,"Well, it took him a long time to get there, but eventually Stephen Chow (who is currently the box office king of China) got a movie properly distributed in the USA, and it was ""Kung Fu Hustle"", his elaborate and funny kung-fu homage. Although (or perhaps because) this one isn't family appropriate like ""Shaolin Soccer"" and ""CJ7"", it was the most successful in America of any of his films so far.The story takes a little while to get going, because like all the Chow movies I've seen this one has a multitude of characters who are somewhat developed. First there are the three ""hidden masters"", men who have left behind the kung fu lifestyle to live among ""regular"" people but who rise to the occasion when thugs threaten the neighborhood. The central character in the story, however, is the one played by director Chow himself, Sing -- a weak moron who imagines that he will become a wealthy criminal by joining the notorious Axe Gang. He's accompanied by equally slow-witted but loyal Bone (Chi Chung Lam). In addition to all these heroes, the landlady (Qiu Yuen) and landlord (Wah Yuen) are so dynamic and entertaining that they threaten to steal the movie. And there is a series of genuinely creepy and bizarre villains, from the mambo-dancing crime boss (Kwok-Kwan Chan), the two harpists who kill with music, and the seedy deranged veteran master known only as ""The Beast"" (Siu-Lung Leung).A lot of people are going to talk about this film in terms of kung fu, but I'm personally more interested in the philosophy that's expressed, often through humor, rather than the actual fighting. Chow seems to favor a fantastic style of kung fu that is accomplished through computers anyway, and he's never had renown as a fighter. What he is, and deserves to be, famous for is his wacky sense of humor and his ability to convey off-center perspectives. As is usually the case, his hero here is a character who is more than just humorously flawed. He manages to make us more comfortable with the ghetto environment of ""Pig Stye Alley"" than we are with the plus and Westernized surroundings of the Axe Gang. This is a very impressive film in terms of the way that the design in the sets and the costumes came together to reinforce and heighten the director/writer's goals.My only regrets about the film is that it feels a bit overstuffed, perhaps too processed. They really felt the need to get so much into this package that sometimes the story seems to get lost. I don't think Chow's character takes enough of the center stage, and the romance is perfunctory. You could say that it's primarily a comedy so those things shouldn't matter or don't need a lot of time, but they still didn't work for me as well as they did in the case of ""Shaolin Soccer"" where I felt the story itself and the characters were more vital. It's hard to look at this movie as a thing in and of itself; it often refers to other Chow films and also to various kung fu classics. So I think there's a bit of static or conflict between various aspects of the ""homage"" and the actual story of the film.",Kung Fu Hustle

Everyone, and I mean everyone knows kung fu, the stunts and powers get crazier and crazier with each fight, the bad guys are sleek beyond believe, the good guys are humble and hardworking, the music accompanies everything perfectly and luckily the special effects can keep up with all this madness.What really makes this film work, though, is the fact that it doesn't take itself too seriously. It's a comedy at its heart, gently mocking and parodying the kung fu movies and anime series that have so clearly inspired it, yet at the same time it pays homage to them. It respects its genre and it shows. But, in the end, it's here to have some fun, which is great, because it'd be so easy for a movie such as this to be unbearable if it tried to have you buy all of its outlandishness as a straight up action.The actors are also very talented, beautifully straddling the line of being just badass enough to be taken seriously and still lighthearted enough to garner the laughs needed. Special mention to Stephen Chow as Sing, the cowardly main character, and Qiu Yuen as the frumpy landlady that holds the whole block in terror under her dainty slipper shoe.Kung Fu Hustle is over the top, it's ridiculous, it's loud and bombastic, it's unbelievable, it's funny and groan-inducing.

Having Sing(Chow) set the fireworks on the gang would be bad enough, his fat sidekick wannabe was even worse. He stabs him, dump snakes on him, and worse yet, annoys Sing all the time. And for the Landlord and Lady, they would be experts in Kung Fu. I was surprised when the Landlady had the power of the Lion's Roar. No one could ever withstand that might. Even the Beast could stand up to that, except when the bell was used as a speaker. Hey! There were no speakers in the 1940's were they? Sing wises up after the beating he endured and I think he should have been more wary of con men, when he was younger. I think he should have been giving a big bop in a few areas.

This is a good example of Hong Kong cinema being able to challenge Hollywood movies.The plot of the film is that 1930s Shanghai, and the Axe Gang runs the streets of the city. Most people live in fear of the gang, expect for a poor district known as Pig Sly. The Axe Gang get humiliated when they end up fighting in the district and found out the most of the citizens are expert material artists. The Axe Gang are obviously annoyed and hire a number of assassins to take on the district, which leads to some epic fights.The film is very surreal and cartoony in its approach, which I think is very fitting. It is very humorous, the language barrier was not a problem. It also has homages to other films like the blood in the corridor scene from the Shinning and the fight at the end with the Axe Gang which was similar to the fight with the Agent Smiths in the Matrix Reloaded (the best scene in the two other Matrix films). The material arts fights were really good: the choreographer was Yuen Wo Ping, who worked on the Matrix, Kill Bill and Fearless. It is also a homage to Jackie Chan movies but I think it better then Jackie Chan. I admit I'm not much of a fan, I like him as material artist, but not as an actor. It is violence, and like other modern material arts films from Hong Kong and China it does focus on detail and is very theatrical.Kung Fu Hustle is a good film, especially for fans of material art films, Jackie Chan and Asian cinema.

42,dee.reid,"The ""Hustle"" is on!",10,9 August 2005,"""Kung-Fu Hustle,"" where to begin. Well, for starters, actor and director Stephen Chow is quickly becoming one of Asia's most beloved screen comedians. At 42, and already a veteran of numerous comedies, Chow finally broke through to American audiences with ""Shaolin Soccer"" in 2001. Now he brings forth this comedic vehicle, ""Kung-Fu Hustle.""This movie has it all: slapstick comedy (that's right out of a ""Looney Tunes"" short), martial arts, and dazzling spin-kicks and arm-twists that are all courtesy of Yuen Wo Ping (""The Matrix,"" ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""). In this picture, which is set in 1940s Shanghai, China before the revolution, Chow stars as Sing, an aspiring gangster who wishes to join the notoriously lethal ""Axe Gang."" The Axe Gang rules much of the city's underground with an iron fist and their demands are absolute. But the accident-prone Sing and his chubby companion (played by Chi Chung Lam) wander into Pig Sty Alley, posing as Axe Gang members. The Axe Gang doesn't bother with this slum very much because it's so poor and plus, it's already under the tyranny of the vicious chain-smoking Landlady (Qiu Yuen), who runs things along with her husband Landlord (Wah Yuen).Things become complicated when the real Axe Gang shows up, and the Gang is attacked by a trio of kung-fu masters who had been living there. The Axe Gang members are quickly defeated in the ensuing chaos while Sing and his companion are captured by the fleeing gangsters. The two are allowed to join, but are demanded a deed of loyalty - kill someone. For the next 45 minutes or so, Chow is off the screen, and we focus mostly on the tenants of Pig Sty Alley, as the kung-fu masters square off in dazzling skirmishes with Axe Gang acolytes, who are masters themselves. Landlady and Landlord are also later revealed to be masters too.Chow reenters the picture and remains on the screen until the closing credits, where he, donning a white outfit a la Bruce Lee himself, takes on the remaining gangsters in a free-for-all reminiscent of the ""Crazy 88's"" scene from ""Kill Bill."" As it turns out, he is a kung-fu genius, in that he's had the power to master martial arts since birth (I must say Chow does display some impressive moves of his own). He then does battle, in the film's most over-the-top sequence, with The Beast (Hsiao Liang), who is the most feared kung-fu master of them all.This is a brilliant action-comedy from a mind that seemed destined to bring forth something like this to the masses. The film plays out a lot like a collision between every great martial arts movie we've ever seen and then adds a heavy dose of slapstick and Chow's sly wit. You'll laugh at Chow's comedic antics, as every great kung-fu flick gets its fair share of comedy. It's just kind of funny, since I was watching ""Enter the Dragon"" (1973) last night, which is considered the greatest martial arts movie ever, and then today I watch ""Kung-Fu Hustle,"" which could be called one of the greatest parodies of the genre.Though some of the humor might be lost on American audiences, I found myself laughing quite a bit. It definitely caught on to me as Chow also pays sly homage to his heroes, both Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan, who made the genres Chow pays respect to. It's all done in a deliriously comic fashion that also doubles as a visual feast for the eyes. The film also contains a rather touching subplot with a mute girl Sing once saved from bullies, and it really got to me because of the cheesy music that cues up whenever they are on the screen together.""Kung-Fu Hustle"" is one of the best pictures I've seen this year so far. I expect we'll see a lot more of these types of pictures that are going to be cherished by a devoted following in the future. Stephen Chow has crafted a funny, brash, and action-packed picture that's sure to remain with the masses in the coming years.10/10",Kung Fu Hustle
43,drqshadow-reviews,Style Over Substance in this Wacky Wushu Playground,7,11 July 2019,"Wacky, cartoonish martial arts action with a big CGI budget and rampant imagination, similar in tone to Stephen Chow's preceding work, Shaolin Soccer. It's very much a case of style over substance, as the plot only serves to move us from one outrageous set piece spectacle to the next, and makes no bones about it. That's Chow's style, with far more focus on effects-laden fighting techniques than inscrutable storytelling, and it works for him. We're treated to dozens of unique forms, from countless unexpected sources, as nearly every denizen of a dusty, lower-class slum turns out to be a kung fu master of some sort. Most memorable, of course, is the chain-smoking old landlady, who batters every comer and effortlessly steals each scene without even pausing to pull the curlers from her hair. It's indulgent and silly, watery and childish, but it's also richly entertaining and singularly stylish. Great background party-viewing material.",Kung Fu Hustle
44,CubsandCulture,Delightfully Insane,8,10 June 2019,"I find myself unable the tell you what the plot actually is. I have no idea how the universe of this film works. There are many moments where I have no idea what is happening. None of which matters. The film is a visually feast, the gags mostly land and the weirdness ends up being completely charming. This is a live action cartoon mixed the a Kung Fu destiny story. It is an action comedy where each are the focus. What a great style for a fun film.Sadly, the film is slightly marred by a mean streak that is misplaced and keeps bunting into the fun. There are two different running homophobic gags. Everyo once in awhile the films goes too dark and/or graphic. Of note the lovable rascal that is the heart of this film complains about how he hadn't raped anyone yet, which just doesn't work as a joke. This streak happens just enough to be annoying without fully ruining the tone.This film is just so much fun.",Kung Fu Hustle
45,kluseba,An overrated embarrassment to the martial arts world,3,13 July 2012,"Kung Fu Hustle is one of many high rated modern Chinese movies where I don't understand how comes it's so well received and critically acclaimed in the whole wide world.I must admit that the movie kicks off with a couple of solid jokes and some sympathetic characters that may addict you. The first twenty minutes or so are entertaining and promising.But the downward spiral starts soon after. The lazy, stereotypical but somewhat sympathetic character of the main hero's corpulent friend almost disappears. The fight scenes move away from aesthetics and get more and more random, ridiculous and unreal. The plot development is strange but not in a good sense. The dialogues are thin and seem as if they were written in a hurry. We get some horrible special effects towards the end that add the little cherry on the top of your cheese cake.I'm aware of the fact that this movie somewhat wants to parody the stereotypes of classic Chinese and Hongkong Kung Fu movies. I'm a big fan of these old films and I have no problem with a good comedy or a solid homage to them. This movie is not an original parody with many déjà-vu moments but a very childish attempt to attract a larger public. The jokes work in the beginning but the same ideas are repeated all the time and we get to see more and more exaggerated fighting techniques with over the top slapstick moments throughout the whole movie. Many movies that mix martial arts with comedy fail to find a good balance between both styles and I don't like most of these attempts but this film here is one of the worst attempts to combine these two genres. I usually adore Asian humour a lot, especially in many South Korean movies but this one is comparable to the bunch of Hollywood parodies that came out when Scary Movie rose to fame.In the end, I would only recommend this movie to somebody that laughs about anything and almost only watches any kind of comedy movies. Any fan of the artistic side of martial arts or modern Chinese cinema should stay away from this superficial embarrassment.",Kung Fu Hustle
46,Enchorde,Like a cartoon,8,1 October 2005,"Recap: The city is ruled by a gang, called the Axe gang and ordinary people live in terror while the gangster lives in luxury. Only poor people are left alone and in the alley of the Pig Sty (?) life is running it slow course. That is until failed wannabe gangsters Sing and Bone happens by, and poses as members of the Axe gang. The people in the alley won't give up that easy and soon the real Axe gang is involved. However, the people seem capable to defend themselves quite easy. This infuriates the leadership of the Axe gang, and they are not too happy about the impostors Sing and Bone either.Comment: This movie is just like a long cartoon. Not that it is animated, but a lot of the effects and characters abilities are similar to those in a cartoon. And just as many cartoons are funny and entertaining, this movie is too. Actually, it is hilarious from time to time. The movie possess both visual comic along with sharp twists and turns and dialog (altough dubbed). The directing is very good, use of special effects are excessive, but that is just fully in line with the rest of the movie, so it is fine. In short it is a good performance of all involved, both in front and behind the camera. The result is a really funny movie with a lot of laughs.8/10",Kung Fu Hustle
47,Agent10,Stephen Chow's most vivid film to date,7,24 April 2005,"Stephen Chow has always been a pretty slapstick sort of director, but he really veers away from a lot of those ideals with Kung Fu Hustle. The movie as a whole tends to lack the fun loving attitude he had in previous movies like God of Cookery and Shoalin Soccer. What we get instead is a pretty darkly humored, violent film that tries to illustrate what The Untouchables would have looked like if Robin Williams and Jim Carrey were on the marquis. In short, it seems awkward.But hen again, that was most likely Chow's intent, taking a page from American cinema so the violence might seem more accessible. What I really did like were the scenes with the assassins which really embodied the more classic elements of Asian cinema and Chow's own wild vision. I was also pleased to see Kwok Cheun Chan had a better role this time around, considering he was my favorite character from Shoalin Soccer in the role as Empty Hand. Take this movie for what it is, and you'll enjoy it.",Kung Fu Hustle

Kung Fu Hustle was really good and you do not have to be a longtime fan of the genre to like this. While reading many reviews here on IMDb, I was struck by how many comments there were on the humor in this. I was a bit skeptical but they were right.This movie is FUNNY. Over the top but funny! It also contains some great visuals, the action scenes were amazing(particularly at the end) and what's more there's still a good solid plot that comes together in the end in a great way and will even give you a little emotional tug! This is a movie that definitely had it all.It was either this or Sin City and I'm glad I chose Kung Fu Hustle. It sneaks up on you as well, I didn't even realize how into it I was until it went on a bit and I was on the edge of my seat. This is very definitely a recommended viewing.

51,Rob_Taylor,Kung Fu-ntastic!,8,3 June 2005,"Often I watch films knowing little more about them than the title, and whatever I can guess from that. Kung Fu Hustle was just such a film. I have to admit that, for the first five minutes or so I was worried. These first few minutes aren't particularly funny, designed to set the scene and show the audience how bad the ""Axe Gang"" is.I figured it (from those first minutes) as a standard kung-fu movie made on the cheap and thought I was looking forward to endless ""slappy-fu"" style fights where the combatants beat on each other for twenty minutes at a time without hurting each other. But, I told myself it had to get better.Boy, what an understatement that turned out to be! Once the madness begins, it doesn't stop. Most of the comedy is visual, naturally, in a subtitled movie, but it just won't quit! Many of the scenes are so intricately involved that the comedy contained therein just increases in intensity as the scene unfolds. Examples include the knife-throwing scene and the lighter-in-the-car scene. The comedy keeps at you in these scenes long after you're sure that no further humour can be wrung out of the moment, yet Chow manages to squeeze every last drop of laughter out of it.Another item which just adds to the insanity is the CGI. Being honest, the quality of it isn't that good (with some notable exceptions such as the assassins' musical swords and knights) but that only adds to the fun. Plus, it all goes by so rapidly that you often barely have time to notice it as CGI anyway.There's also some dodgy wirework on show, but again, it all adds to the surreal nature of the movie and the fun-factor.I mentioned the subtitles earlier. I'm not a great fan of them. Too often they distract from what is going on, or flick past too quickly to read in some dialogue scenes. Here, though, I'm happy to say that they've been done extremely well. The translation is excellent, and often the comments are funny in and of themselves. Similarly, they never obscure or distract from the action. In fact, they add to the overall effect of the movie immeasurably.I've tried to imagine what the film would be like dubbed, but I can't see it being any better than the subtitled version. If they ever do a dubbed version, I hope they pay as much attention to the voice acting as they have to the subtitles, or it could be a serious let down.Kung-Fu Hustle is not easily described. Some of the early Jackie Chan movies are similar, though without the CGI, obviously, but even they can't come close to the silliness on offer here. It's like some insane genetic splicing of kung-fu, Benny Hill and the Matrix.Let's just say I haven't been so thoroughly entertained by a film since the first time I watched Airplane, and I haven't laughed so much, for sure. Unlike that particular comedy film, though, I suspect the humour of KFH will last a lot better. If you want to see what martial arts comedy should be like, this is where it's at.There's little more I can say without ruining the scenes, except to say go and see it, don't be put off by the first few minutes and just enjoy!",Kung Fu Hustle
52,Matt_Layden,Crazy Cartoon Kung Fu Comedy Action,9,26 May 2010,"A young man and his friend try to join the notorious AXE GANG, but in doing so they need to do some pretty nasty things. Through a series of unfortunate events the axe gang stumble upon this place called pig stye alley and they cause chaos for the people who live there. This causes kung fu masters who live there to reveal themselves and begin a war. The young man, Sing, nearly dies during a battle and is reborn as a kung fu master, who must fight the evil one known as The Beast.I saw Shaolin Soccer and was surprised by how much I loved that film. It had soccer, kung- fu, great comedy and hilarious off the wall moments that would never happen outside of the world created in the film. Chow has taken this concept to the next level with Kung Fu Hustle, a brilliantly funny and ass kicking kung fu film. The quotes about the film are true, it really is a Kill Bill Meets Looney Tunes flick. Chow is Sing, the lead character, who wants to be really bad. He has trouble doing this because he is horrible at it. It all stemmed from a troubling childhood, in which he was sold some wacky looking kung fu manual, which made him think he knew kung fu. When he sees a young deaf mute girl being picked on, he tries to use his kung fu to help her. Oops, he gets his butt kicked and then he gets urinated on. How's that for humiliation. Now that he's older, he thinks the only way to get things in life is if you take them by force. So he joins the axe gang, but has a battle of conscience and is nearly killed. This unleashes his kung fu skills and then the poop hits the fan.The film is off the wall wacky fun. The kung fu in the film is really well choreographed and with the added use of funny CGI, it takes the film to another level of entertainment. Chow uses numerous references in his film, from Kill Bill to The Matrix to The Shining. It's fun to spot them here and there. The film never feels like it's cheating or copying others, it's definitely it's own unique film. It just knows where its inspirations are. I can't recommend this one enough, it has numerous re-watch capabilities. I find myself watching it every time it is on television. If you're a fan of Chow and Shaolin Soccer, Kung fu Hustle manages to outdo it's predecessor. It might take some people a moment or two to get use to the animated style used in the film, it is very Bugs Bunny/Road Runner. Go in with the right expectations and you will have fun.",Kung Fu Hustle

It loses a little momentum in the latter half when the comedic elements are pushed to the side and the fighting is given sole focus, but overall, Kung Fu Hustle is a great movie for fans of stellar, fanciful martial arts fighting, fans of physical comedy, and those who like to dabble in both both genres.

54,winner55,Kung fu hustlemania,9,20 June 2006,"Stephen Chow has been a thorn in the side of Hong Kong critics for more than a decade, now - his main claim to fame is his ability to resurrect Cantonese comedy in the era of the increased sophistication of the Hong Kong ""New wave"". (Cantonese comedy is a style of low slapstick - Benny Hill is a good Western equivalent - lots of locker-room humor and farting.) In Kung Fu Hustle, chow has managed to increase his general level of sophistication, and at the same time use computer graphics to construct a film that is totally fantasy. I found it amusing. 'Fu purists will object that there is naught but wire-works in the fight sequences; but this isn't really a kung fu film, it's really a comic fantasy, similar to Mel Brooks' Blazing saddles in the lightness with which it treats its subjects. Not for all tastes; but as I am hardly a Chow fan, I think the fact that even soeone who doesn't like Chow's brand of comedy could like this film says something positive about it.Also, there are enough references to classic 'fu films to satisfy the purists - as long as they're looking for a comedy and not a 'fu film.Look, the special fx are good, and it's a funny film; really grows on you with repeated viewings.",Kung Fu Hustle

There is great mocking about Kung Fu and also about the ""deep"", intelligent quotes that Kung Fu heroes sometimes give us.But still, this is really nothing more than funnier and more intelligent Monty Python sketches, including some Buddha jokes.

There are many special effects that sort of work, given the over the top, almost fantastical nature, but even then, there might have been just a little too much CGI near the end (for my liking at least).But there are too many great sequences to complain too much, none of which I'll try to explain, because words can't do them justice. Most of the action is immensely satisfying, and a good deal of the comedy is hilarious.Rides the line between 3.5 and 4 stars for me- it's more than just ""good"", but I don't quite love it enough to call it ""great"".",Kung Fu Hustle
59,blott2319-1,Hilarious Kung Fu craziness,8,15 April 2020,"There's no denying that I am a fan of Stephen Chow's style of comedy. Kung Fu Hustle has that perfect tone of a spoof film, and knows exactly how to use certain tropes of the genre it is parodying in order to create humor. I love the exaggerated way that kung fu works in this film, and how the most unexpected people or items can be dangerous. It's amplified to such a level that at times it feels like a live-action cartoon, and for me that is always good for a laugh. When I sit and watch a movie at home by myself, even a solid joke can struggle to get much more than a chuckle from me, but Kung Fu Hustle had me laughing out loud consistently. The other thing that Stephen Chow understands, is that even the best comedy needs plot and structure. There is a solid story in this film with genuine stakes, heroes and villains, and all the other hallmarks of a good narrative. I also appreciate his casting choices, because he doesn't go with all the obvious actors for each role, and allows for some unexpected heroes.I must admit, though, that Kung Fu Hustle contains one of my biggest pet peeves about movies. I always struggle when there are people in a story with seemingly limitless powers, or at least power that doesn't appear to adhere to any set of rules. While it's good for some comedic effect, I never get a feel for what move is more powerful than another. The final fight keeps escalating to a point that it feels like there is never a satisfying conclusion, because they both seem to recover from even the most devastating blows. I know it's supposed to be silly and over-the-top, so I didn't get that annoyed by this aspect, but it is a tad unclear when the fight will truly end and someone will win. My only other nitpick with Kung Fu Hustle was how late they brought the main character into his heroic role. His redemption arc starts so far into the movie that it barely feels earned. These are quibbles with an otherwise amazingly enjoyable film. I might not find Kung Fu Hustle perfect, but any movie that entertains me this much is one I'll watch again any time.",Kung Fu Hustle

61,sharky_55,Kung Fu,9,10 February 2018,"Kung Fu Hustle is a comedic triumph, the high point of actor-director Stephen Chow's career over the decades. Before the international hit, he spent years refining his trade as the wacky, roughly-hewn rascal with just the right amount of gold in his heart. Chow plays the bad guy well enough; a bit of stubble, ragged sleeves rolled up, and just a hint of manic crazy in those eyes when he brandishes his little pocket knife that suggests he'll do anything to make it big in this uncaring world. His goal is to ascend to the top of the criminal underworld and join the ranks of the legendary Axe Gang - and Chow's opening scene is a testament to the sort of style and status that he admires. The word here is cool; the top hats, the black suits, the jazz backing, the sashay of Brother Sum as he approaches another victim. Think the goofy KKK clansmen in the Coen's O Brother Where Art Thou, only without the uncomfortable historical baggage. Chow blends touches of class (the slow pull out from within the police headquarters, the inhabitants frozen in fear), realistic grit (black and white newspaper headlines documenting their reign of terror in 1930s China) and pure chopsocky fun (the operatic ridiculousness in the slow motion axe taking off a leg) effortlessly. But while the cities are under constant fear, the slums of Pig Sty Alley live so sloppily they are practically immune from all the outside whizbang. The setting is built up like an old style Hollywood set on the studio backlot, a towering structure with a life of its own, reminiscent of that in Irma la Douce or Rear Window. We find the beating heart of a community that becomes a character in itself - here money is immaterial, luxury is a foreign language, and its petty squabbles are only surface conflict. Chow riffs off traditional wuxia stories by plucking legendary heroes out of the ordinary village fabric, martial arts masters for one day and then back to their modest living. Even with the Buddhist-steeped redemption arc of his own character Sing, it's clear that Chow is attempting to undo some of the mythos surrounding these action figures. They fight out of sheer necessity to protect those who can't, but in the meantime they're tailors and cooks and labourers. The story is the proof that Sing needs to see; that good guys can come from any walk of life, whereas ambition without restraint can often lead one down darker paths.Chow's always had a penchant for goofy, unrestricted action, with liberal use of wire-work that doubles as slapstick comedy (Flirting Scholar comes to mind). He would hit his creative peak with Kung Fu Hustle, in which a quaint village becomes the arena for an increasingly zany series of martial arts battles. The set design is there to be a battered and collapsible playground; walls crack with relish, and stone banisters go flying in bits so regularly it's surprising there are any stairs left by the end of the film. Chow enlisted the best to choreograph his fighting sequences, among them kung fu royalty in Yuen Woo-ping, who brings the same rapid, weightless intensity that the Wachowskis asked for in The Matrix. His sequences verge on the edge of realism, as if real life had merged with a cartoon. Elsewhere there's more of the same slapstick in the way that CGI and sound design lift the live action motion, with puffs of dust trails, legs whipping up into a blur, and Axe Gang cronies dropping like flies from up above and splattering onto the ground. Hear Sing rack up hits like an arcade game in the climatic melee, and the machine gun rattle of the toes broken by his fast feet. And listen to how the traditional Chinese instrumentation like Erhu and the Guzheng build to thrilling crescendos, and in one scene become the actual weapon in a stylised martial arts showdown. It's not every movie that has slapstick and pathos all rolled into one, and leaves us satisfied by the end that the protagonist has come of age, and finally realised his place in the world. This is broad stuff, but Chow has always excelled at the scruffy everyman, the rascal, and although I mention he plays the bad guy well enough, he's not good enough for a pure villain. He doesn't have that snarl, or the complete mean streak. There has always been good in him. There's nothing in those cheap manuals worth a damn, but it's what inside that counts, and in the final scene where the camera swings around and takes us back into the past, we once again glimpse the little boy who believed he could save the world.",Kung Fu Hustle
62,MrGKB,Sorry I missed this one in the theater...,8,22 May 2006,"...but even presented in the shamefaced full-screen ratio of a library DVD, ""Kung Fu Hustle"" is a triumph of visual storytelling. Stephen Chow is one auteur actor/filmmaker I'm glad I finally discovered. ""Kung Fu Hustle"" has the noir stylishness of a ""Sin City,"" the spectacular sets and coloring (and at one point, choreography) of a ""West Side Story,"" the giddy antics and action of a Chuck Jones cartoon, and the fantastic imagination of a Chinese fairy tale all wrapped into one wildly entertaining movie.

63,KnightsofNi11,So much fun!,8,16 July 2010,"Kung Fu Hustle is an action/comedy kung-fu movie from Hong Kong born director Stephen Chow. It is set in 1940's China during a time of political strife. Gangs are running rampant throughout the many districts and the Axe Gang is the most feared of them all. The only districts that are safe are the poorest ones because the gangs have little interest in them. It is a story of survival against the wicked Axe Gang as they terrorize a poor village, all because they were humiliated once by the three kung-fu masters that live in said village. Stephen Chow plays the shaggy and unkempt Sing, whose only wish is the be one of the bad guys and join the Axe Gang. He does so by posing as an Axe Gang member with his friend Bone (Lam Chi Chung) who attempt to terrorize the village in which the story is centered around. This of course all ends in disaster and sparks two stories, one following Sing's quest to join the Axe Gang, and the villages war with the Axe Gang.While Kung Fu Hustle has a story that keeps you interested, it is the incredibly over the top action that makes this film one of the most entertaining I've ever seen. It is very campy and cheesy, but it is all intentional. The fight sequences are very memorable and they will keep you guessing at what insane heights the movie will reach to next. It is an ingenious blend of comedy and kung fu action that constantly keeps you wanting more. You should not get bored of this film. It never lets up with the ridiculous action. Every fight sequence is different and every single one will wow you to an endless extent. I'm not one for a movie that puts story to the wayside and lets the action take over and somehow Kung Fu Hustle manages to avoid that. The story is always there, no matter how simple it might be. Everything this movie accomplishes is so beautifully blended together that it amazes and mystifies, all the while keeping you laughing hysterically at how over the top everything about it is.Kung Fu Hustle is ridiculously fun entertainment at its best. If you want something different that you've never seen the likes of before then this movie is for you.",Kung Fu Hustle

65,carbuff,"Non-stop, live action, martial action, cartoon that is highly entertaining but perhaps too violent for children",9,14 March 2020,"""Kung Fu Hustle"" is a supremely entertaining film which is essentially a live-action cartoon with spectacular visuals. It's plot isn't much deeper than any Saturday morning cartoon I grew up with, but the violence is amped-up by a considerable amount, so much so that this film seems inappropriate for pre-teens.I never stopped wondering what was going to come next, but this movie is much more of an amusement park ride than a serious film. I must say that the Chinese (I'm too lazy right now to make sure it's Chinese) seem to be much more comfortable with pretty intense violence than an equivalent American film would be. To me the mix of action/comedy with harsh violence was kind of unsettling . As a matter of fact, after watching this film, I personally wouldn't want to go to war with the Chinese. I must say though, that the film did end on a particularly emotionally touching moment that caught me off guard.I wouldn't want to watch similar ultra-violent, martial arts, comedy films too often, but I'll certainly be looking to add some additional ones to my viewing periodically. I just hope that I can find others that are as captivating as this one was.",Kung Fu Hustle

67,eminkl,Great background party-viewing material,7,17 April 2020,"Wacky, cartoonish martial arts action with a big CGI budget and rampant imagination, similar in tone to Stephen Chow's preceding work, Shaolin Soccer. It's very much a case of style over substance, as the plot only serves to move us from one outrageous set piece spectacle to the next, and makes no bones about it. That's Chow's style, with far more focus on effects-laden fighting techniques than inscrutable storytelling, and it works for him. We're treated to dozens of unique forms, from countless unexpected sources, as nearly every denizen of a dusty, lower-class slum turns out to be a kung fu master of some sort. Most memorable, of course, is the chain-smoking old landlady, who batters every comer and effortlessly steals each scene without even pausing to pull the curlers from her hair. It's indulgent and silly, watery and childish, but it's also richly entertaining and singularly stylish.",Kung Fu Hustle
68,gregsrants,A wild ride. Great Fun!,8,13 March 2005,"If going to the movies is all about having fun, you can't do much better that Stephen Chow's fist-furious comedy, Kung Fu Hustle. A follow up to his highly successful Shaloin Soccer, Kung Fu Hustle is part comedy, part musical, part kung fu action film and part parody of American big budget films like Gangs of New York and The Matrix.Set in China in the early 1940's, the movie primarily focuses on down on his luck Sing (Chow) who aspires to become a member of the much feared 'Axe-Gang' that goes around terrorizing citizens and police officials using their weapon of choice, you guessed it.axes.Pretending to already be members of the notorious Axe-Gang, Sing and his sidekick (Chi Chung Lam) saunter into Pig Sty Alley aspiring to rip fear and respect from the commoners residing in the one apartment community. But Pig Sty Alley, as it would seem, is the Justice League of America of China. Unbeknownst to even its citizens, certain members of the society have powers of martial arts masters. But when the real Axe-Gang members wander into town and begin to institute their own brand of dominance, a tailor, a baker and manual laborer rise to the occasion and the resulting kung fu battle leaves the ground littered with wounded black clad baddies.This turn of events does not sit well however with the Axe Gang leader and he solicits the help of two musician hit men (in a scenario reminiscent of Robert Rodriguez's Desperado) to snuff out the three new threats to the gang's credibility. Their success only leads to the revelation that there are two other members of the complex that have powers that must be reckoned and another more feared enemy known only as the Beast is called upon to bring the community to its knees. It is during the Beast's strong-arming of the locals that Sing slowly comes to recognize his own inner strengths and his true calling on the opposite side of the conflict.Kung Fu Hustle has already become the highest grossing film to come out of Hong Kong with over $150 million already in the coffers before the flick even hits the lucrative American theatres. Nominated for 16 Hong Kong film awards Kung Fu Hustle has a little something for everyone in what can maybe best be described as Big Trouble in Little China meets The Matrix with a touch of Zucker/Abrahams humor. And what a ride it is.Director, writer, actor Chow does a fantastic job of juggling genres and introducing us to some of the most outlandish characters to grace our big screens in many a year. A woman who's power is called the Lion's Roar, the musicians who can throw knives and even skeletal warriors from their instrument and an old man mimicking powers of a toad are just three examples of Chow's eclectic group of Mystery Men.But maybe more crowning of an achievement is the intermix of comedy  slapstick at that  with the action that dominates and drives the film. If the saying, ""Drama is easy, comedy is hard"" be true, then Kung Fu Hustle's blend of Naked Gun type gags coupled with eye popping special effects and a subdued love story must have been an undertaking that had the films financiers saying an extra prayer every evening. What other film could incorporate a dance number with a group of axe welding thugs and then later have a scene where one of the expected heroes of the film loses his head while innocently walking through the streets at night.Inspiration for Kung Fu Hustle could have come from a Looney Toons episode of the Road Runner and Willie E. Coyote. A scene where Sing and the landlord race at Ferrari type speeds down a desert road results in a hilarious head on collision with a road side advertisement and was one 'Beep Beep' away from being anime.And hereto is where the production crew should get their chops. Kung Fu Hustle had the budget of The Matrix's advertising team's caterer but provides some of the best fight scenes and special effects that I have seen so far this year. Take for instance the scene where the landlord uses her vocal power through a makeshift blow horn to completely decimate the Axe-Gang run casino or the twisting of limbs when the Beast takes on his adversaries, these scenes crackle with originality and the production values that rival even anything produced by the major Hollywood studios.I have very little bad to say about Kung Fu Hustle. Even the musical score by Raymond Wong was memorable and well chosen. Everything seemed to fit and despite a small gap of story development where both the action and the comedy take a back seat for about 10 minutes, the movie is top rate and deserves the West's attention.",Kung Fu Hustle
69,aesgaard41,Bugs Bunny Humor in a Kung Fu Movie,9,31 January 2008,"I typically don't watch Kung Fu movies. I've seen a few Jackie Chan flicks, but Kung Fu Hustle really opened me to the genre, and it is mostly mostly on the basis of the humor and the plot that I appreciate it. The story is based around the Steven Chow character, a street kid who grows up trying to be a criminal while trying to ignore the fact he is really good. When his actions result in the attack on a small slum and the deaths of three Kung Fu masters, he must join up against the gang and the psychopath he helped them release from prison. That there is where the movie really comes together, that by accepting who you are do you ever receive inner peace. It's the cartoon humor and the mystical fighting styles that capture the attention, without it, the movie is just a message picture. The plot and style highlight the movie very well, and the humor is innocent, making the incidents that much more funny even when they are preposterous. I recommend this movie to anyone interested in seeing it.",Kung Fu Hustle
70,ajs-10,Damn good FUN!...,8,10 November 2010,"I have a vague recollection of seeing parts of this film before, maybe after a few beers one night. Needless to say, my attention wasn't fully focused on the screen. So it was nice to sit down (sober) and watch it in its entirety. A very enjoyable film with some great comedic moments, excellent CGI and some tremendous fight sequences. But more of that later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters please ignore the next paragraph).It's Shanghai in the 1940's, competing gangs run the city and the most powerful is the ""Axe Gang"" led by Brother Sum. Only very poor neighbourhoods escape the gangs and one of these is Pig Sty Alley, a housing complex run by a crazy Landlord and Landlady. Sing and his sidekick Bone have ambitions to join the Axe Gang and one day they turn up in the Alley posing as Axe Gang members and start some trouble. This comes to the attention of the real Axe Gang and they intervene. Unknown to them, living amongst the down-and-outs in the alley are three former Kung Fu masters who defend their turf with great zeal. Brother Sum, seeking revenge, employs two assassins who are ultimately defeated by these three and another two other, rather unexpected, Kung Fu masters. Now quite furious, Brother Sum allows Sing, a skilled lock-pick, to join the gang and sends him to spring the ultimate assassin, The Beast, out of jail. We are now all set for the big showdown but Sing still has a part to play in the outcome.I really enjoyed this film; even the subtitles didn't detract too much from the action on the screen. The film has a comic-book style, which, although it relies quite heavily on CGI, is brought about more by the script, the set design and the actors than the computer generated visuals. Great performances all round, particularly from; Stephen Chow as Sing, Qiu Yuen as the Landlady, Wah Yuen as The Landlord, Kwok-Kwan Chan as Brother Sum, Zhi Hua Dong as Donut and Siu-Lung Leung as The Beast.There are some great comic moments and many plot twists that take the audience on quite a journey. You never quite know just what is going to happen next. If I have a criticism, it's that the fight scenes did drag on a little bit too long, but apart from that, a very entertaining film. It's one that left me with a smile on my face and that's always a good sign! I would certainly watch it again and so it's highly recommended.My score: 8.1/10",Kung Fu Hustle
71,russem31,Hilarious and inventive,9,2 December 2005,"This film really surprised me in a good way. I didn't know what I was getting into when I saw the film on DVD. I thought it would be another Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon but instead turned out to be an animated-like comedy. What's amazing is that this movie is dependent on CGI but the CGI is only there is move the story along not BE the story. It blended perfectly with the action sequences which were ingenious and believable. And the fact that in this CGI environment, the acting was natural is even more surprising. Kudos to director Stephen Chow for giving us a perfect blend. I really also enjoyed how the story progressively gets out of hand and by the end of the film, the action sequences are so enormous and spectacular, you feel like you just want more and more. Hopefully there's a sequel brewing. I definitely would see it!",Kung Fu Hustle
72,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Funny and inventive,8,7 June 2007,"Sing and his good buddy really want to join the city's main gang - the axe gang. Their only problem is that they are a pair of bumbling guys that can't do anything gang-related. But they decide that at least they can pretend to be in the gang, which leads to them being confronted by the real gang.Who would have ever thought that a thin plot line and extensive special effects could actually make a good movie? Stephen Chow must have figured that problem out and my best guess as to what he did here was just add some good humor and stir. In addition to the fact that the special effects are very imaginative, but even this alone often makes bad movies. But once again, there is plenty of wacky humor here. All the best comic timing anyone can remember from watching cartoons in elementary school is here in good doses. A chase scene, as as our hero Sing escapes from an angry landlady, is reminiscent of ""The Roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote"" cartoon and it is positively hilarious. The stylized comic extravaganza gets only better from there.The film also critically spares the viewer excess. There is plenty of action and lots of obvious computer effects, but nothing is really overdone as is typical of many Hollywood movies. The action and special effects don't seem reused throughout the movie, each stunt/effect is given just enough screen time to be enjoyed, but then something new is shown. A scene where two musicians fight two ninja masters really shows this - nothing is repeated in that scene. Each attack/fight move/stunt, real or magical, is always fresh. The scene is one of the most inventive fight scenes ever and a good high point in inventiveness and special effects use. --- 8/10Rated R, kind of unfairly, for mainly comic violence and cartoonish mayhem.",Kung Fu Hustle
73,FilmOtaku,Insanely entertaining,8,27 April 2005,"Being a complete sourpuss when it comes to most comedic film offerings from the last three decades (though I attribute a lot of that to inanity rather than taking full credit for being a wet blanket), I find that when there is a film that makes me laugh so hard that I am concerned about the possibility of a stroke, I have no choice but to rave about it. So having said that, consider this a rave review of Stephen Chow's ""Kung Fu Hustle"".While the film itself was entertaining, the prospect of summarizing the scattered plot is not. Set in 1940's Shanghai, ""Kung Fu Hustle"" basically centers on a tenement ruled over by a mean, chain-smoking landlady (Qiu Yuen) and her whipped husband (Wah Yuen). When someone deigns to complain about the fact that they don't have enough water to take a quick shower, she pounds them senseless, with everyone standing by completely helpless. Flip to another part of town, where the notorious ""Axe Gang"", a deadly bunch of dancing, axe wielding guys are wreaking havoc on a city that can't even be protected by the police. The two areas of town don't concern themselves with one another until a wannabe member of the Axe Gang, Sing (Stephen Chow) and his sidekick (Chi Chung Lam) poses as a member in the tenement to extort money, causing a series of events to occur in the tenement that wind up with most of the Axe Gang either killed or injured and Brother Sum (Kwok Kuen Chan), the leader of the gang, to do everything in his power to wreak revenge on both the tenement and its occupants, particularly those who act as its safeguards.As I mentioned earlier, there were a lot of parts that I found so funny that I was either finding myself almost lightheaded from laughing so hard, or finding myself obnoxious because I would struggle to recoup in order to read the subtitles in time to not miss anything. While there are several movie ""in jokes"" (even one dedicated to Chow's prior film ""Shaolin Soccer"") it was the sight gags that really did it for me. The chase between Landlady and Sing and especially the knife scene with Sing and his sidekick were brilliant slapstick. A lot of the action was extremely over the top, and complimented by some pretty decent CGI work.While anyone who has seen ""Shaolin Soccer"" knows that Chow does not employ a normal cast of ""heroes"", it was still interesting to see that for the most part, almost anyone who could have heroic qualities attributed to them did not fit the ""normal"" model. As a matter of fact, several of the major players in the film were middle aged or even elderly, a notion that is both funny and refreshing for anyone who looks for something a little different in their heroes. Surprisingly, there was also a very well conceived scene in the middle of the film involving two professional assassins who are trying to kill the main defenders of the tenement that I found to actually be a pretty kick-ass action sequence. Despite a couple of gags here and there, until the end when the Landlady got involved, the scene was playing off like something I would say ""cooool"" in an awed tone about in a Tarantino film or something. So while the film was overall one of the funniest I've seen in recent memory, there were a couple of great moments of highly stylized action.""Kung Fu Hustle"" wasn't a perfect film by any means, but the criticisms I have about it are completely nitpicky. For instance, the romance between Sing and the mute girl was just kind of thrown in, though some of it was necessary for background on his character. And a purely aesthetic complaint; I wanted more dancing by the Axe Gang. Chow shouldn't have teased us with the little bit that they danced and then abruptly take it away for the rest of the film. Hey, it's a review  I've got to air the good and the bad.But since the good outweighs the bad exponentially, I highly recommend ""Kung Fu Hustle"" to just about anyone because of both its action and comedic elements. For making me laugh to the point of near-aneurysm, ""Kung Fu Hustle"" gets a solid 8/10.",Kung Fu Hustle
74,Son_of_Mansfield,Deliciously Out Of Whack.,9,18 August 2005,"Kung Fu movies are inherently ridiculous with their balletic indulgences. This movie exploits that constant over the top action with slapstick and Looney Tunes gags. I laughed out loud during the husband beating, the inept knife throwing, the Road Runner chase, and the Pinball battle scenes. Everybody knows some Kung Fu from the frumpy landlady and her wussy man to ""The Beast,"" who looks more like a Florida resident than a Master. But like all great comedies, this movie pays tribute to the same movies it jabs at. The fight scenes in this movie are better than any American knockoff. The special effects and sound effects are quite good, because action needs sound and those stylish snapping noises are here whenever anyone is hit. This belongs in the same class as The Princess Bride and Shaun Of The Dead.",Kung Fu Hustle
75,tomimt,Genuinely funny comedy,8,27 November 2005,"I laughed hard. This, I believe, is a very good sign when you watch a comedy.Kung Fu Hustle is partly a movie parody, as it takes lots of element from other movies (Spiredman, The Shining to name a few) but it mostly concentrates on doing impressive, yet so over the top action scenes that you can't do nothing else but to laugh out loud.In 1940's China the streets are ruled by the gangs and the most notorious of all are the Axe's. Sing (Stephen Chow) is a petty criminal, who want's to be a member of the Axe gang, so he decides to rough up a slum area in hopes to impress the gang leader. Too bad the slums are home for the legendary Kung fu masters. And they won't give up their home that easily.As said, the script takes lots of elements from other movies, as it is a parody. I found this movie to be lots of fun, even though I'm not an expert in the field of kung fu films. I'm rather sure, that the experts in that field will find more familiar elements from the film than I did, as the main element of parody is martial arts films.

76,anselmdaniel,Highly entertaining comedy,8,11 May 2019,"This review contains spoilers.Kung Fu Hustle is a comedy movie that premiered in 2004. The movie is directed, written, produced, and stars Stephen Chow. The movie is the journey of a petty crook called Sing as he tries to join the Axe Gang. The movie is about his escapades as he comes into conflict with both the Axe Gang and the Pig Sty residents.Kung Fu Hustle is a relentlessly entertaining movie. This movie features so much humor and comedy. It has a slapstick quality to it which makes the movie into a live-action Looney Toons cartoon. The action and comedy scenes in this movie are the top highlights. This movie is highly engaging because of these action and comedy scenes. I felt that Stephen Chow's performance across direction, writing, and acting was incredibly apt as they make the movie flow well. These fight scenes are also one of the best action scenes in Kung-Fu movies. The action is so frequent like the slapstick comedy that the movie continues to flow at an electric pace.If there are any criticisms on Kung Fu Hustle it would be on the lack of focus. The movie focuses on Sing but the earlier part of the movie had focus on the Kung Fu masters in the Pig Sty and Axe Gange rather than on Sing. Since the movie needed to have this as the scenes were integral to the plot, it did not feel like it worked perfectly as it pulled screen time away from the protagonist.I would recommend 'Kung Fu Hustle.'Grade: B",Kung Fu Hustle
77,DonFishies,"An unconventional, yet pretty funny, disappointment",7,13 April 2006,"After watching Kung-Fu Hustle in its entirety, I am left with very little words. While not being a slapstick comedy from beginning to end, I'm not really entirely sure what to think of the movie. It's my first Steven Chow film, but even in that, I find it very difficult to talk about the intensely silly film.Taking us back to 1940's China, Hustle revolves around Sing. You never really hear his name, but you learn early on that he just wants to be accepted. He tried fighting for the good, but has decided that it's not paying off, so he wants to be bad, and join the infamous Axe Gang. They control most of China, except for the poor slums. After a chance encounter with an obnoxious landlady, Sing starts off a turf war that can only end with one group falling to the other, but neither wants to back down.Basically, that's the plot of Kung-Fu Hustle. Nothing imaginary by any means, but a lot of the zany fight sequences are just that. Zany. The quote on the front about it being a cross between Looney Tunes and Kill Bill really wasn't a lie. There are more than a few scenes of about 50-60 guys in black suits surrounding one person to come and kill them. And on more than a dozen occasions, the silliness of the film rules out and it becomes somewhat of it's own Looney Tunes reality joke. Chow is fairly good in his role, as is everyone else who steal his spotlight.But the thing I found the most interesting about the picture was the art direction. 1940s China looks absolutely gorgeous. From the set-pieces to the vivid colours, I was amazed at how excellently the backdrops were created for the film. From the costumes to the buildings, to even all the little random objects, it all screams nostalgia and screams of being excellent. The cinematography is not all too bad either.If there was anything to say against the film, it was the fact that none of the characters are really well explored. There are no signs of showing why Sing feels the way he does, except for one silly flashback scene. Even when a pivotal character shows up (so pivotal in fact, she has all the 10 minutes of screen time, and zero lines), his motivations are never really explained well enough, and he just seems to be fighting randomly. Same goes for everyone else. There was mention of a son by the landlady and lord, yet never explained for its significance later on.It's moments like these where I know I should just enjoy it for what it is, but the fact that key parts of the film's writing is missing, really does not help the film.7/10.",Kung Fu Hustle
78,Antagonisten,Quite funny,5,15 March 2005,"I can start by admitting that Asian comedy has never really appealed to me. I don't know if it's the fact that their sense of humor is so different to the one i have. Anyway, i decided to give this a try after hearing many good things about it.The plot revolves around a poor neighborhood trying to defend themselves from a gangster organization. Their best defense is the Kung-fu masters living there, but when the gangsters bring in reinforcements someone else has to step up.The plot doesn't make much sense at all. The first twenty minutes i didn't understand at all what was going on. But soon enough it doesn't matter really. If there is one thing i do not expect from Asian comedy, it is an intelligible plot. Rather soon the movie goes into a higher gear, becoming more fast-paced. It's not difficult to see that it's Woo-Ping Yuen that did the fight choreography. In some parts it's quite similar to ""The Matrix Reloaded"" with mass scenes, one protagonist fighting of dozens of opponents. Whether you like his style or not is up to you. Myself i prefer a more realistic touch, but the wire work and choreography is top-notch here, all in all it's nicely done.The comedy itself ranges from poor to rather funny. The thing that works best is the more physical jokes. Like the sometimes hilarious fight sequences. This is not for everyone though. And i still keep my reservations about Asian comedy. This movie has not convinced me otherwise. I enjoyed it, but i doubt i'll watch it again. For people who know that they like the Asian brand of comedy though, this is well worth watching. It's one of the best i've seen in the genre. I rate it 5/10, but with reservations for personal taste being what it is.",Kung Fu Hustle

83,dfle3,At times hilarious satire of martial arts movies. Repeat viewing value,9,21 August 2008,"I've been meaning to put up a review of this movie after I originally saw it during its cinema run and loved it. Watching this movie again on SBS TV the other night gave me a chance to check out whether the movie had stood up as well as I remembered. It has. For a lot of recent Hollywood movies I've reviewed here recently and given good scores to (say, 7 or more out of 10), I have had one quibble-would the movie have repeat viewing value? In the case of many Hollywood movies I liked, like, say, ""Transformers"" or ""Iron Man"" et.al., the answer would have to be ""no"". ""Kung Fu Hustle"" is thus getting full marks for me-it has 'repeat' viewing value.Not sure if the intro to the TV version movie toned down its opening-I seem to remember the cinema release having a more gruesome scene than what I saw the other night. Or maybe it's just not as brutal as I remembered. In any case, the opening serves to illustrate the brutality of a large and villainous group of criminals known as ""The Axe Gang"", who terrorise even the town's police force.Next we see two buddies, Sing (played by Stephen Chow) and Bone (played by Chi Chung Lam) who are small time scam artists trying to get financial advantage by pretending to be members of The Axe Gang. They try their scam in a part of town that refuses to be intimidated by them. Somehow, the real gang is drawn into their scam and the gang gets whipped by the residents of that part of town. The rest of the movie concerns The Axe Gang's attempts to teach these townsfolk a lesson and the choice of Sing and Bone on which group to ally themselves with.Watching the movie again, I was reminded of how hilarious it was. There were numerous ""laugh out loud"" moments for me, e.g. the scene where Sing tries to act tough with the townspeople but finds all sorts of reasons not to fight them. Hilarious.There is also a delightful romantic subplot concerning Sing and a childhood sweetheart of his as well.This movie deconstructs/is a satire of Kung Fu clichés. In fact, whereas I found the seriousness of the unbelievable martial arts in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" too much to take seriously, the even insaner martial arts in this movie were a positive joy. It's quite cartoony at times, too. Reviews of this movie will often mention its debt to classic Warner Bros. cartoons, like ""The Road Runner"" etc.91/100",Kung Fu Hustle

Incredible stunts and Kung Fu combo's give the movie that quality that only comes for a great Kung Fu movie. What this movie does is gives the viewer more of a story.

The cinema was empty, the two of us and the projectionist - although it was all digital so who knows if someone was there, and when the movie began I just wasn't sure.The movie opens strong, with a wonderful mix of visual styles and periods. The sets give the feel of a western, and the gang clothes give the impression of 50's America, with the Police looking just like Police today. These opening scenes are pretty strong, loud and violent, and so my expectations were whipped in the opposite direction as an axe murder and shooting rivet you to the spot. That's when the dance number begins and you're whipped in another direction. Nervous laughter ensues.I think that paragraph defines the film quite well, not that you really can define it, but if you imagine genres and styles as straight lines, traditional movies will pick one at the start and pretty much stick to it, yes it might flip back and forth from it's neighbour, but what it won't do is weave a criss-cross path back and forth between them all. That's what Kung Fu Hustle appears to do, it grabs from different styles, genres and movies and pulls them together in a rich weave of a movie, something you're not really used to.After that the movie comes to the current period and begins the story in earnest. The laughs start from the beginning, but to be honest we were still reeling from the opening and being thrown back and forth. At this point I wasn't sure whether I was laughing because I thought I should be, or because it really was funny. I didn't know what mode or genre I was supposed to be in.What quickly happens though is that you forget that standard you've been conditioned to expect by those endless reams of movies you've watched, and suddenly, out of nowhere, you're enjoying the ride. Then you really do start laughing.After all, I would really describe this as a comedy, but it also brings you some amazing Kung Fu mixed with Hollywood blockbuster effects, a smidgen of a love story, and a tiny bit of thriller. It's also a huge tale of good and evil, and what it does take to be truly one or the other. Yeah, but it's still a comedy, and one that pokes a finger at Hollywood in the process.Most of the humour is bizarre and off the wall, and I'm not sure that's entirely down to the culture difference. I wonder if even Asian viewers would be feeling some of what we did during the early parts of the movie. However it works, it really does, it grabbed me and made me laugh and I was often laughing at the movie itself and not the story.The story is great fun and it's a massive story at that, not just some small tale, but an epic. This is, as the young boy is told, about saving the world, it's that big. With that, I'm afraid that's all I'm going to say, if you want more on the story read someone else's review and have it all given away, or go and see the movie and revel in the first time viewing.The fight sequences are something else, they've done an amazing job to make the fights so seamless and to be able to visualise the effects during the choreography. The fight scenes coupled with the stylistic effects they provide some breathtaking scenes all fantastically choreographed by Sammo Hung Kam-Bo, and managing to keep a good feeling of fun throughout.Apart from being surprised by the scale of the movie, the huge effects and the excellent fight sequences, the acting was pretty damn amazing, and not just from one or two of the actors but from everyone. Not one of the actors stood out as being out of place, and not a single one seemed to be dwarfed off the screen by the sheer number of actors around them. I have to say that my favourite is the camp Kung Fu Master, the way he slipped from complete mastery of Kung Fu and strength of body and mind to his camp character running around the set was superbly entertaining.Stephen Chow is totally natural in his role and plays both sides of his character extremely well. Never mind the fact that he co-wrote, Directed and co-Produced too, he's pulled out a stunning performance with an amazing movie.Really I don't think I can find any fault with this movie because there is so much to it. I could keep writing about it and praising each individual element, actors, effects, story, but the beauty of this movie is that it is so much all at once. It's that rich weave of so many styles and genres that I already mentioned. Think of it as a beautiful dress, you can't dissect it and being to critique the individual strands of the weave, you loose the beauty of the dress and of seeing it being worn.If that sounds cryptic, it's supposed to. I can't give you anymore than that. You just have to take my word for it that this is a stunningly good movie for so many different reasons. Relax, let it flip you around, and enjoy.",Kung Fu Hustle
87,diac228,Do The Hustle! Kung Fu Hustle is entertainment heaven for those who want pointless amusement,10,6 August 2005,"Are you bored? Do you live a boring life? Do you want something different in your life? I recommend this: go to the movies. Oh, don't fret, I know that lately the movies have been nothing more than a lot of disappointments, mind numbing horror flicks, and romantic comedies starring grade A actors. Of course if you live a boring life, that means you do not have that significant other as of now. Don't fret. Watch Kung Fu Hustle. Yes, I know, it looks totally weird, different, and stupid. But there is one sure thing; this is one of the most entertaining movies in a very long time. You do not need to actually think much, but just sit there and be blown away by the visuals, laugh your butt off at the physical comedy, admire the jaw-dropping fight scenes, and also get teary-eyed at the sentimental scenes. Kung Fu Hustle is 95 minutes of fast-paced in-your-face action that leaves you with a smile on your face throughout the entire film.From the first scene to the last, you will be seeing things that you do not see in regular films. For starters the beginning of the movie features a dance sequence involving a gang of professionally dressed axe-carrying assassins. Kung Fu Hustle is about a wannabe gangster trying to join the ""Axe Gang,"" while the Axe Gang is having trouble with the strong citizens of a certain deserted area outside the city. Throughout the film you see the main character try whatever to join the gang, and you will see the gang go to extraordinary lengths to teach the landlady and the landlady's husband a lesson. What makes this movie so great is that the movie combines good old-school kung fu action with excellent visual and special effects, and also a few action and chase sequences that look like they were ripped off of old Warner Brothers cartoons. The plot is very simple and easy to follow, but it will be all the chaos that will lure you into the film.Fighting. More fighting. Countless fighting. It is all there. Whether it is one man against an entire gang, a few citizens against blind assassins wielding a deadly musical instrument, an insane man against a powerful couple, a very loud lady against her husband, or an old-fashioned brawl amongst the citizens just for the sake of fighting, Kung Fu Hustle will deliver so much action, it parallels the action-packed Kill Bill (Volumes 1 AND 2). And then there are the Looney Tunes-style scenes. The visuals shine during these scenes, especially the chase between the landlady and the main character (Sing, played by the director/writer of the film, Stephen Chow). Mostly the cartoonish action is for humorous moments, but at other times the style of fighting also became serious, at one point it even resembled Dragonball Z, the infamous anime that stretched a plot to incredible lengths (20+ episodes it took just to show one fight).With most good all-around films, you also get your sentimental moments as well. With this film, there is this sad scene with Sing and his bitter past and how it shapes up his personality. There are other moments but I'd rather not spoil them for you. The acting is not the world's greatest, but like most action-packed films, it is not necessary as long as there is enough going on to keep you on your feet. There is a lot of slapstick and physical humor that makes up for the lack of jokes involving dialogue; so if you are the kind that does not laugh at a typical businessman beating down two wanna-be assassins or a guy throwing a knife at a woman, only to have it bounce back and stab him, then you are not going to find this movie as funny as other people would.Bottom Line: One of the best films in a very long time. Very well directed, plenty of effort was put into this, and it pays off. Plenty of action, comedy, and also with a dab of good music and drama fills the bill as the 95 minutes watching this is much better than just watching the typical two-hour movie. I had a lot of fun watching this, reminds me of the old days when I would watch cartoons that have no plot whatsoever but did not matter because they were just fun to watch over and over again. Surely this film will not get the box office success that it deserves, because it is too goofy for people, and some teenagers (and adults) will fear that their ego will be tainted if they are caught watching this. Come on everyone, watch this foreign masterpiece and do the hustle! Score: 10/10",Kung Fu Hustle
88,asc85,A cultural disconnect?,5,11 May 2005,"I was very much looking forward to seeing this movie, as it did so well in the Hong Kong film awards. The idea of a comedy/action movie seemed very appealing.Unfortunately, I didn't find this film to be very funny. I think this is perhaps a difference in cultural sensibilities. I'm sure there are American comedies that leave the Chinese clueless, and I was clueless with most of the humor of Kung Fu Hustle.At the end, the focus shifts more to action, and I enjoyed it much better at that point. I'd like to say that the voters of the Hong Kong Film Awards don't know what they're talking about, but then again, I say that just about every year when the Oscars pick the so-called ""best"" films of the year.",Kung Fu Hustle

The funniest film since dumb and dumber, Most funniest this decade. Kung Fu Hustle in the ultimate Comedy spoof with mixes of Martial Arts (Kung Fu), Comedy, Crime (Gangster related), Cartoonic violence and lots of adventure. The fight scenes are unrealistic, but like Kill Bill vol 1, it Entertains to the max. Stephen Chow gives us a great movie once again after the funny Shoalin Soccer. The movie is directed and also stars the same actor Stephen Chow. If you like martial arts, whether in movies are generally, you have to enjoy this movie. Its unpredicatable, just as you see a gang of 1000 Axe Gangsters, you know it will be tough to defeat them, but No. There are better fighters, one ofter another, with their own skill.

91,barrys82,"This movie is epic, a real modern masterpiece",9,24 August 2007,"this is a great movie in so many levels. I didn't expected much about it, I supposed it would be another goofy comedy that involved martial arts, I was so wrong. this film can be compared with those old time kung-fu movies only that this has the advantage of special effects thing that make it even more spectacular, and that the movie is intended in a satirical way. It has a great story about a guy who only wish is to be a a member of the Axe gang and when he finally have the chance to be part of it, he has the chance to redeem himself. I has a perfect ambientation of the post revolutionary China of the 30's, great costume design. The direction from Stephen Cow is excellent, he gives the movie the perfect rhythm to make it enjoyable and to keep you on the edge of your seat. It has a lot of funny moments, the action and adventure is unstoppable, it also has the necessary drama and even a little romance at the end. The special effects are simply awesome, the fights are perfectly choreographed that it seems real. Everyone in the cast delivers a very decent performance, specially from Stephen Chow that begins as a bad guy and end as the hero of the movie. In conclusion, this is a very enjoyable and entertaining movie that has it all comedy, action and adventure, drama, romance and even dancing. Such an epic martial arts film.",Kung Fu Hustle
92,curtis-8,One of the Year's Best,10,19 May 2005,"This movie has everything--comedy, drama, pathos, incredible action, slapstick, great acting, a great story, wildly inventive absurdity, actual thematic threads (a long gone element in US films), moments of sheer poetry, and genuine heart. In true HK style, it has a bit of everything. Not only was it a much, much better martial arts film than either the more respected ""Hero"" or ""House of Flying Daggers,"" it was a much better film, period. In fact, ""Kung Fu Hustle"" was one of the best movies of any kind I've seen this year.It's great that Columbia Pictures/Sony Classics gave this movie a US release with only minor cuts (which, now that I've seen the uncut HK version, should have been left in). But it is obvious that they had no idea how to market it, though they spent a lot of money trying. They pushed it only for its comedic elements, positioning it in the media as a wacky spoof of Kung Fu movies, like ""Blazing Saddles"" was for westerns--which it is not!But I don't really blame Columbia for Kung Fu Hustles weak stateside box office--I blame those morons at Miramax! Yeah, you heard me you two! I think that this great movie would have found a much bigger audience if Miramax, the US distributor of Chow's previous film, ""Shaolin Soccer,"" hadn't so utterly botched that film's US release, showing it heavily cut in only a couple of theatres before dumping it unceremoniously onto video. While not all Americans are familiar with the conventions of the HK Kung Fu flicks of the Seventies (which admittedly does help when viewing Kung Fu Hustle) EVERYONE in the US knows soccer. I think Soccer could have been a US smash along the lines of Crouching Tiger, if handled properly.In a perfect world, the more easily digestible ""Shaolin Soccer"" would have been Chow's huge US hit, paving the way in the American public imagination for this far superior follow up. If Chow had become the US star he should have a couple of years ago, Americans would have lined up for Hustle even if they had never seen a kung fu movie in their lives. But it was not to be. People didn't know who Chow was and couldn't tell what kind of film was being marketed; they went into the theatres expecting to see a dumbass gross out parody and left disappointed.It's just not right that more folks in the US haven't seen this great film. Let's hope for a second life in the USA from good DVD sales.ps--and by the way, I don't think Kung Fu Hustle is really doing parodies of either The Matrix or Reservoir Dogs as is way too often mentioned in reviews. Both of those flicks borrowed HEAVILY from previous Hong Kong movies so I think it much more likely that Chow was referencing the original Hong Kong movies, with which he and other Asians would be most familiar, not the American imitators.",Kung Fu Hustle

94,refresh_daemon,Crazy and bizarre kung fu sendup/homage,7,1 February 2007,"I watched this movie with my cousin over Thanksgiving weekend (the day after watching the previous movie). Having seen Chow's previous film, Shaolin Soccer, I went in expecting total lunacy, of a humorous sort. Well, that's what I got.In its most inspired moments, the film is a ridiculous amalgamation of international pop culture and kung fu film legacy. And like the previous film, there is a dance number.The production values of the film are higher than its predecessor, but I do have to fault the film for being even more scattershot than the previous work. The central supporting characters appear to keep changing focus to the point that you start to wonder whether any of them are really important. Also, the principal protagonist isn't well focused on, especially in light of the spotlight thrown onto the various support characters. The tone and pace of the film is again manic, however, the film is unable to effect the sheer lunacy of the previous work, as there is no particular ""building"" towards the ending. The final confrontation is a bit of a deux ex machina and you don't have enough of a meaningful connection with the primary protagonist, so when it happens, you're left with a bit of a ""so what?"" response.The film is enjoyable in the end, because of the manic madcap homages and bizarre upturning of filmic conventions, but loses cohesiveness due to its inability to focus on the overall story. Consequently, the dramatic tension is flattened, similarly to the parodic inventions of the Wayans clan, and isn't able to make its epic confrontations particularly epic.Still, if you want to watch a crazy and bizarre kung fu sendup/homage, this is a good place to go. Just don't expect anything amazing. 7/10.",Kung Fu Hustle
95,Quebec_Dragon,Loads of fun,8,23 May 2009,"This Hong-Kong style kung-fu parody was quite funny and imaginative. It sports an over-the-top cartoon feel with lots of great slapstick humor and chop-socking martial arts mayhem. Although the visual effects should certainly be praised for their dynamism and inventiveness, they also looked somewhat fake at times. One could argue it works in the context of the film. I enjoyed the character actors, but wasn't blown away by their acting skills, and it was cool to see old Hong-Kong action actors (unknown to me) kicking butt in such a stylish way. The fighting choreographies were amazing with literally unbelievable yet beautiful moves. If you're in the right frame of mind and preferably with a bunch of friends, this film should be loads of fun.Rating: 8 out of 10",Kung Fu Hustle
96,TheHande,Impressive Martial Arts Extravaganza,9,20 July 2007,"""Kung Fu Hustle"" is a movie for those who like their Kung Fu films as over the top as possible. This film succeeds in introducing every Kung Fu and Wuxia cliché imaginable and makes fun of them as often as it can. The cast of characters is wonderfully cartoony as is much of the comedy.On the other hand the film has a very severe story which helps it cling on to credibility. Unfortunately it also leads to the film's rather sluggish ending.I'm tempted to say that this is the Hong Kong equivalent to ""Kill Bill"" but it's not as gory or even that serious.

100,rparham,A hilarious epic,8,23 April 2005,"I can't remember a film that was as much of a joy to watch in recent memory as Kung Fu Hustle. It is an entertaining, riotous comedy that combines action and humor flawlessly to provide for a great two hours in the movie theater.Directed by Stephen Chow, who is also the star, Kung Fu Hustle is in some ways very much in the vein of the martial arts films of Jackie Chan in that it is not afraid to play as a comedy while featuring some outstanding stunt work and impressive stunt sequences. Unlike some martial arts films, which seem a bit two full of themselves, Kung Fu Hustle knows it's ridiculous and revels in this fact.For the uninitiated, Kung Fu Hustle is a foreign film, full of subtitles, but that doesn't stop it from being entertaining to American audiences. It is set in a city where the downtown is ruled by a vicious gang known as the Axe Gang, who's leader, Brother Sum (Kwok Kuen Chang), has an affinity for executing anyone in his path to total control and power. On the outskirts of the city, in a slum run by an overbearing landlady (Qiu Yuen), two strangers, Sing (Chow) and his slow-witted friend (Chi Chung Lam), arrive posing as members of the Axe gang. They quickly find themselves in the midst of a brawl between the people living in the slum and the real Axe gang. It is only with the assistance of three martial arts masters who are living in anonymity and peace in the slum that the Axe gang is fought off. Not content in accepting defeat, Brother Sum seeks the help of outside killers, including two deadly musicians, and finally, as a test of Sing's desire to enter into the Axe gang, he is forced to free The Beast (Siu Lung Leung), the greatest killer ever, from a mental asylum to fight off the kung fu masters at the slum.Kung Fu Hustle is a wild mixture of styles meshed together: at some points it is almost a straight martial arts film, at other moments it is a slapstick-style comedy, and at yet other times is a borderline live action cartoon. As with many other martial arts films, it often operates outside of the boundaries of the real world, with actors defying gravity and the laws of physics with their wild acrobatics. However, unlike films such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, which progress as if existing in the real world, Kung Fu Hustle makes no excuses for it's outrageousness and doesn't even really try to pretend to be realistic. Yet, at the same time, much of what goes on has an internal logic that works in the film and doesn't leave the audience scratching their heads and walking away with a feeling that the film is just too silly to be believed.Kung Fu Hustle isn't afraid to reference many films that it is obviously borrowing from. There are pieces of The Matrix, superhero stories, gangster pictures, and other martial arts films thrown in here, but it's willingness to wink at the audience makes it's use of this material acceptable. It isn't intended to be original, merely entertaining by working with formulas and situations that most members of the audience should already be familiar with.On the comedy front, Kung Fu Hustle is outstanding. It features a number of great moments, including a hilarious scene where Sing is trying to bait the members of the slum to fight him and quickly realizing that everyone he chooses to fight has some advantage over him. It plays with many stereotypes and uses them to great comic effect (although I wonder how the homosexual community will react to certain moments in the film). And as with any martial arts film worth it's salt, the fight scenes are well choreographed and exciting. Unlike recent American action movies that overdo editing during fights, Kung Fun Hustle manages these scenes very well, allowing us to get into the material.While I know this type of film is not everyone's bag of tea, especially with it's subtitled nature, I would heartily recommend this film to anyone looking for a good time and wanting to finish with a smile on their face.",Kung Fu Hustle

He is very accomplished in martial arts but is also well on his way to perfecting comedic timing, all the while remaining sexy.Wah Yuen was great as the Landlord, a lecherous old coot who seemed to be made out of rubber.Qiu Yuen (the Land Lady) stole the show for me, however. I think everyone knows someone (usually someones mother) who has mastered ""The Lion's Roar"".The stunts were spectacular. It takes a great cast to make a good kung fu movie.

KFH includes other characters like the protagonist's fat-lazy sidekick, harp-playing killers, a frail looking beast, a hamlet's domineering landlady and her husband and some of the hamlet's inhabitants who are all apparently Kung-Fu masters! Comment: KFH is yet another Chingi martial-arts movie with flying that defies all laws of Physics. The audience can find some action sequences resembling the Burly Brawl of Matrix Revolutions and some dialogues from Spiderman. One is left wondering whether some of the scenes are to be enjoyed as Action-sequences or pure-comedy.Considering Chow's track record of Shaolin Soccer (2001), he seems to be adept at confusing viewers between Action and Comedy. Performances can be rated as 'decent' from the comical angle. Although SFX is executed neatly, the similarities with Matrix make it seem exaggerated. Unlike Matrix, which was a dream world, Chinese stunt-men simply don't seem to accept physics. Can someone explain me why every other guy in a Chinese movie is a Kung-fu master?

Talking about a parody, this movie spoofed all the most known Kung Fu films (exept maybe The Drunken Master), even plot was very typical for 70's Kung Fu films and in one scene the Landlady (Qiu Yuen) was imitating Bruce Lee.

This viewer revisited this film and it still stands alone with it's mixture of phenomenal martial arts and sidesplitting comedy. Excellent direction, cinematography, choreography, screenplay, score and acting. The entire cast delivers spot on performances with Chow standing out. The plot is set in the small peaceful town Pig Sty Alley. The world is ruled by gangs instead of the law and the most fearsome gang of all is the Axe Gang. Sing and his sidekick Bone, who are two con artists, stumble into the town trying to convince it's inhabitants that they are part of the Axe Gang. The Landlady rules the town with an iron fist and rules her husband Landlord with an even harder fist. She does this promoting peace over violence and does not take kindly to any intruders that practice the latter. Not all the residents of the town are as they seem which Sing and Bone learn of quickly. Their impersonation of being members of the gang reveal the presence of three kung-fu masters Coolie, Donut and Tailor who immediately dispose of the Axe Gang and their leader Brother Sum. This prompts Brother Sum to hire two musicians that play a magical instrument which propels swords, knives, shock waves and warriors that defeat the three kung-fu masters. We then learn that Landlady is a master and she fights off the musicians with her voice. In the aftermath the townsfolk want to fight back but Landlady, who always prefers peace, explains that it would take a natural born kung-fu genius which is one in a million to defend the town. The Landlord is also a master. Once again Brother Sum enlists help from the best fighter of all, The Beast. This results in a brawl in a casino between Landlady, Landlord and The Beast which ends in a draw with a little help from Sing. Fleeing back to town to recover from the fight it is then revealed that Sing is actually the natural born kung-fu genius. The Axe Gang and The Beast come to town for one last showdown unaware of who awaits them. The plot is clever, witty, rare, wonderful, uproarious, perfect and has a poetic ending. There are so many memorable scenes in this film. The best are the scenes shot in a cartoonish style.

If this was a tale of a one man to fight the bad guys alone, this might have been good. It is not. This is just a really stupid movie. This was so bad that I flipped the channel after forty minutes. I could not take this anymore. What an awful movie. Even while wasted, this still sucks. That's terrible. One last thing, I could have been much better off without seeing some guys ass too. I just kept on saying ""PULL UP YOUR PANTS YOU DOUCHE!!!!"" You will know what i'm talking about.The Last Word: Painful.",Kung Fu Hustle
110,Calaboss,Even If You Don't Like Kung Fu Movies...,8,3 January 2017,"This film IS all over the place, but even if you are just a film buff with no interest in Kung Fu films, this is worth a watch. With tons of references and homages to other movies, from Fred and Ginger to Bruce Lee, and from The Shining to The Matrix, it's kind of fun just to look for them.It has both comedy and serious elements, but you have to look fast for them, because this movie is fairly relentless with the action. This has a huge budget for a Chinese Kung Fu film too, and you can see right where it goes because there is CGI mayhem aplenty. And that leads to the only group of filmgoers who will not enjoy Kung Fu Hustle at all; those who do not like action films. This is not a real talky film, and seems to let the action do most of the talking for it. You might not like it, but it never gives you much of a chance to get bored.",Kung Fu Hustle
111,arthera09,did not take itself seriously and that made it good,7,17 May 2007,"In all honesty I have seen a lot of kung fu movies and think some of them are totally over the top while trying to be serious. Don't get me wrong I love Kung fu movies, but I liked this one a lot because it did not take it self serious at all. It made fun of those movies that are serious, but in a campy way. Some of the visuals really surprised me and the one that I really enjoyed was the hand in the building. The fighting was good and the choreography was fun, but not anything super special. The parts that kept the movie from being serious was the scenes when they were just over the top with the symbolism (like the butterfly coming out of the cocoon and the clouds over the asylum), and I think it actually added perfectly to the theme of the movie. I also like the whole classic approach that the gang had. I really like the dance sequence (which was totally absurd) and the whole look of the ax gang. Overall a very enjoyable movie, but not something I would watch over, or a movie I would recommend to everyone, but it was a fun to watch and I enjoyed it a lot more than I would have thought.",Kung Fu Hustle
112,Benjamin_Cox,As fun as it is weird - 70%,7,18 December 2005,"Martial arts and comedy rarely go together, unless you're laughing at a Steven Seagal movie. Only Jackie Chan seems able to get the mix right and to be frank, most Chan movies are fairly similar anyway. But now, there is a new judo-chopping comedian on the scene - Stephen Chow. Having given us a taster of his films with the amusing but bizarre ""Shaolin Soccer"", Chow goes well and truly overboard with ""Kung Fu Hustle"" which is possibly the most over-blown, chop-socky action film in existence but unlike some, this film is a great deal of fun.The film take place in 1940's China where the police are powerless to stop the vicious Axe Gang from ruling the city. But down in Pig Sty Alley, things are much more peaceful. At least, until petty thief Sing (director Chow) and his overweight companion Bone (Chi Chung Lam) begin masquerading as Axe Gang members and begin panicking the locals. Soon, real Axe gang members arrive and chaos ensues. Before long, a full-scale riot is on the cards between the gangsters and their prize fighter The Beast (Siu-Lung Leung) and the residents with their assorted fighters. But where will Sing's loyalties lie, with the Axe Gang or the citizens of Pig Sty Alley? Let me just say that although story-telling isn't the strong point of martial arts movies, ""Kung Fu Hustle"" is one that bucks the trend. It is, at times, hilarious as well as being one of the most visually stunning films I've seen. Imagine ""Matrix-style"" violence and kung-fu with Looney Tunes touches such as the banter between Sing and Bone (the moment where they try to assassinate the landlady (Qiu Yuen) is just brilliant). This is probably the best Asian film I've seen since ""House Of Flying Daggers"" and is probably even better - I enjoyed watching this film more than I did watching Daggers, despite more CG being used.So what's not to like? There are more moments that confuse than annoy, such as the dance scene involving hundreds of axe wielding, top-hat wearing gangsters that feels more like Bollywood than Hong Kong cinema. There are a lot of people who like their kung-fu films and who wouldn't like this - this is not your traditional martial arts film, not by a long way. But I love this film because it is different, because it's not sticking to the formula and is daring to do something original in a genre that has been stagnant for too long. Chow is to be commended for producing a brilliant, witty and exciting film that will delight fans bored with seeing the likes of Seagal grunting through various set-pieces. Watch it and enjoy - I just did!",Kung Fu Hustle

114,diand_,Building on movie genres and clichés,8,20 July 2005,"Gong Fu / Kung Fu Hustle is a comedy action movie made out of different genres like western, martial arts and slapstick and mixed together in an amusing mix. Genres are imitated, genres are spoofed. It takes on a simple film cliché and takes a twist on it. That's where all the fun comes from here. And from the many reference to other movies.The action scenes are great as they are choreographed by Woo-ping Yuen from The Matrix. We have adequate fight scenes, but Chow even makes some fun of the seriousness of these.Of course this is all form and no substance except for the mild social criticism.

Kungfu Hustle is the one. Happenings beyond the logic and science, blended with animated effects and Looney tunes flavor with some hilarious Kungfu fight sequences are some of the highlights of the movie. As far as plot is concerned let me try to explain that in its simplest way Hapless Sing (Stephen Chow) and his dim-witted pal, Bone (Feng Xiaogang), try to scam the residents of Pig Sty Alley into thinking they're members of the dreaded Axe Gang, the real gangsters descend of Shanghai slum to restore their fearsome reputation, never mind if you didn't understand because you have to watch it. Just keep that in mind do not find logics and you'll surely get the laughter and joy with this entertaining movie for 1hour and 30mins.

And full of surprises and cool characters and their funny moves. I like especially the ones done by the tailor and the old man, and not to mention the fighting and action, everything you'd expect in a kung fu movie. The main character who is a kung fu gangster wannabe, is funny especially at the beginning, when he challenges everyone at the slums, they were all ready to fight, but they denied him. And I like the way the landlady who runs fast, her moves were outrageous! And the gay guy and the coolie, they were all cool! And they also have cheesy names as well, such as Coolie, Donut, The Beast, etc. Recommended for all kung fu action fans all around, and to fans of Stephen Chow. Watch it you know you want to.

Every character has their own sense of cartoonish individuality, from Sing's bumbling to the screaming landlady (I crack up every time she does her signature scream), you're sure to have a good time. I wouldn't recommend it to young children since it is bloody and profane, but when they're older they'll certainly get a kick out of it.

119,DennisBergkamp10,"There is no greater movie than, Kung Fu Hustle",9,17 June 2020,"I dont think there is anyone in this world who hates Chinese-flying movies more than me. If you catch me swearing at the television chances are that I was flipping through channels and came across something in which the Chinese were flying. I would rather be shot with a thousands arrows before I watch that nonsense, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.I still remember the first time I came across Kung fu Hustle on television. I was flipping through channels and that scene where Sing is being chased by the Dragons daughter was on. I swore at the television and changed channels in a hurry.As luck would have been while surfing wiki I somehow ended up on a page that mentioned how Kung Fu Hustle has been recognized by film experts for its cinematography and special effects. Literally no one had anything bad to say about the movie.So I decided to put my intense hatred of chinese-flying movies aside just this once and watch the movie. So I watched the movie. And then I watched it again. And then I watched it yet again. I am quite certain I must have watched it no less then 3 dozen times. There is no greater footballer than Dennis Bergkamp & there is no greater movie than Kung fu Hustle.Kung Fu Hustle is absolutely brilliant. Brilliant should change its dictionary meaning to Kung Fu Hustle. It is such a simple story made so well. I could describe the entire plot in less than a minute but when that 1 minute story translates into a full length cinema it is absolutely magnificent. Stephen Chow is a movie God.Words cannot describe how amazing the movie is. It is done so so well. Every character in the movie has been immortalized on screen be it Sing, Brother Sum, The Dragons daughter, The landlord of Pig Sty Alley, the Beast, Coolie, Donut, the Tailor, Sing's friend, Sing's girlfriend. Its like a who's who of the greatest characters ever made for cinema.

120,samseescinema,one of the most critically overrated films in years,2,28 April 2005,"Kung Fu Hustle reviewed by Sam Osborn.rating: 1.5 out of 4A couple years ago a little film called Shaolin Soccer tripped into theaters after being endlessly shuffled around by distributors. The film didn't get around to my area, so I rented it out of the godly Netflix a few months later. I expected a nicely goofy rendition of the typical formula soccer film with some interesting kung fu. What I got was a diluted mess of amateur CGI and a screenplay that seemed to be regurgitated from the mind of an infant. Not much more can be said about Chow's latest outing, Kung Fu Hustle. It's little more than a poor video game concept brought to the big screen. With no story, half-baked characters, and the stupidest sense of humor this side of Barney, Kung Fu Hustle is one of the most critically overrated films in years. That being said, some credit must be given to Yuen Wo Ping and Sammo Hung for their brilliant choreography. Also, it can't go without saying that Stephen Chow does show some hints of talent among this convoluted disaster. He obviously has a sharp eye for visual treats and a creativity that can't be matched. But why does he waste it on this high budget, low grade comedy? I just don't understand. If you must know, there's some excuse for a plot dumped out by the screenplay in the opening sequence. In pre-revolution China, gangs ruled the land. The biggest and most terrible of these gangs was the Axe Gang (original, I know). This Axe Gang goes through each town demanding tribute and killing all who refuse with, yes, axes. That is, until they stumble upon Pigsty Alley. Hidden within Pigsty Alley are a myriad of kung fu masters, all of whom duke it out with a warrior from the Axe Gang. But Pigsty Alley would be lost if it weren't for, wait for it, the chosen one. You get the idea. The whole film plays out like one of those fighting games on video game consoles. If you haven't played one, they consist of a short CGI back-story explaining the beef between the two characters, then an extended duel of boxing, shooting, slicing, kicking, etc. After all this is over, you do it again. Kung Fu Hustle essentially pulls the same trick, creating cute good guys and diabolic bad guys to duke it out in CGI madness, where real prowess in kung fu is certainly not necessary. I have a feeling Yuen Wo Ping spent much more of his time choreographing a computer programmer than an actor. Amidst all this fighting, Chow crams in his trademark ""humor"". This consists of many jokes concerning flatulence, male nudity, haphazard and silly slapstick, and males harassing females. It's just not funny. The humor has been related to that of Buster Keaton and the greats of the early years of cinema. From what I've seen of Mr. Keaton's work, I think he'd cry if he heard that.",Kung Fu Hustle
121,nahumthebest,Watched it 3x so far; awesome initial unique comedy; decent plot; good-to-decent fighting scenes; would watch a sequel in a heartbeat though!,8,1 July 2020,"100% spoiler-free.This is my 3rd time watching this film. Noticed it is on Netflix so I decided to watch it again.The story was written mostly fine except when it comes to the biggest thing the happens with the protagonist; I wish it had been presented in a better way.The movie starts out amazing due to its own uniquely funny comedy; it felt like comedy you would see in a comic book. Loved the beginning. Unfortunately, the movie later completely abandons all comedy and only focuses on the plot and fighting scenes. The fight with the two assassins was really cool. The second-to-last battle was decent. The final battle could have been better written and choreographed. The ending was satisfactory although it bugged me how a completely broke person can afford to open a *blank*; but the ending was still good for me.The acting I thought was good in general. The protagonist was forgettable but overall the chosen cast were appropriate and I have no complaints.Conclusion: this is a good film that definitely deserves a watch. The plot has one major flaw in my opinion which has to do with the protagonist. The comedy was super funny to me and I was disappointed they stopped going forward with the comedy and explicitly focused on furthering the plot and fight scenes. The special effects were cool. The fight scenes were cool but the final battle left me wishing for more creativity and better choreography. I dropped 2 stars due to the lack of further comedy and the need of better fighting scenes. I would watch a sequel though in a heartbeat!8/10",Kung Fu Hustle
122,AirBourne_Bds,Martial Arts Comedy-Drama taken to Haiiii-Yah! Heights,10,1 June 2005,"Stephen Chow can easily be considered the next Jacky Chan and Keanu Reeves... Moreso, as he wrote, produced and directed this amazing laugh-filled yet thought-provoking epic! As a first-timer, a pretty dramatic feat, here's hoping he can maintain the impetus.I am still trying to figure out if the movie is set in the 30's just before WW2 or prior to the 50's after WW2, but I think that not knowing adds to the mystique! The Axe Gang Boss, was hilarious as he was trying hard to talk like Jimmy Cagney and dance like Fred Astaire! However, as we say here in Barbados, he ain't no sweetbread! His mannerisms and affectations may be something to snicker at, but not his cool and smoldering rage - like when he takes on the boss of The Crocodile Gang (whose own influence was Western flicks).Some of the humor may be lost on Occidental audiences, for instance, it may seem a joke - but spitting is indeed a major or minor offense in many Asian countries depending on the offender's level of health! Another piece of trivia was when Stephen Chow, during the villainous portion of Sing's life and career, was posing with the mute girl underneath the poster like Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire - similar to a tableau re-enactment with Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky.Stephen's debut drew off of many cinematic moments, not just Cagney plus Astaire and Rogers - there was a large dollop of ""The Matrix"" whether Neo's fight with the many Agent Smiths or even the music from the movie itself; Chow also had a Zamfir-like pan-pipes at the end of the picture that many kung fu films use apart from Quentin Tarantino in the end of ""Kill Bill, Volume 1."" The real life Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner chase between himself and ""The Landlady"" was hilarious, and hinted how everyone is not what they seem; especially with her secret ""Master"" power, grab your ear-plugs; there was also the gay tailor and the cook who had hidden sides to themselves, while some were straightforward characters like ""Coolie,"" and ""Sing's"" overweight sidekick.The insane ""Beast"" appeared idiotic but was in fact more evil by not necessarily being evil, but just wanting to fight someone worthwhile - it was this character who added a level of fighting not seen in any Matrix nor most Jet Li and Jacky Chan flicks! In the fight with ""Paris and Helen Of Troy"" - **the Fatal Lovers** - there was a twister/shredder moment as I call it, where you just have to see it to believe it!! When ""Sing"" transformed into the Hero he secretly longed to be, he too added new kicks and blows heretofore unheard of in Kung Fu sagas, it's very obvious that Warner Brothers' cartoons played a major part in developing his imagination! Chow has even left a back-door open in more ways than one for other future ""Kung Fu Hustle(s),"" here's hoping we all can get kicks from them too!",Kung Fu Hustle
123,gila_film,One of Stephen's must-see,8,23 February 2005,"It's been a fun to watch how Stephen Chow evolved from a great comedian into a great director. After directing the impressive ""Shaolin Soccer"", Mr. CHow even shows more talent with his latest, ""Kungfu Hustle"".After the great success of Shaolin Soccer, Mr. Chow realized that he has capability to make more international film. So he must take a three years to complete his latest flick. Still in a very way of Mr. Chow's style, but in more retro touch. This movie is more like a homage to the Kungfu movies from Shaw Bros era, and the taste is good. With breathtaking dueling scenes and surprising plot twist. The plot is quite simple actually but surpassing as a lame flick.If you have a mood to watch kungfu movie, watch this flick. If you want to watch a decent comedy, watch this also. If you a die hard fans of Stephen Chow, so this is a must see. Guarantee to entertains.8/10",Kung Fu Hustle
124,KyleLicht,Absolutely Nuts,10,6 August 2020,"This was a tremendous film. Imagine mixing a cartoon with *Kill Bill *with *Seven Samurai*. It's about a group of poor townspeople who fend off against gang terrorism, with the select few locals who are gifted and powerful. At the same time, a man is desperate to join the gang, in order to validate his masculinity that was taken from him as a child, due to bullying.
There is a lot happening but it all comes together beautifully and ridiculously. The movie is so strange. It's like a cartoon with exaggerated movements and superficial action. I want to say it has poorly done SFX, but it's so bizarre that it works perfectly for what it is. It's an absurd action/comedy/fantasy that really strikes a chord with my strange sense of humor and adoration for absurdism. Also, you'll never see a movie like this again. It's genre-busting, unique, and a tremendous piece of cinema.",Kung Fu Hustle
125,MovieWarfare,There will never be a movie like this ever again,9,12 June 2020,"After rewatching the entire Ip Man series which had a grounded style of fighting, I've thought about a martial movie that was the opposite of that. I haven't watched this movie in ages but I remember it for being the most ridiculous movie ever. I decided to rewatch ""Kung Fu Hustle"" and it is still as grand and ridiculous as ever.
When the hapless Sing (Stephen Chow) and his dim-witted pal, Bone (Feng Xiaogang), try to scam the residents of Pig Sty Alley into thinking they're members of the dreaded Axe Gang, the real gangsters descend on this Shanghai slum to restore their fearsome reputation. What gang leader Brother Sum (Chan Kwok-Kwan) doesn't know is that this neighbourhood doesn't take kindly to interlopers.Let's start with what makes this movie stand out from other movies, the comedy. This movie has very dark humour, for example, the axe gang leader kills two people with a knife and shotgun and then the next scene goes to them all dancing to a cool score by Raymond Wong. You're never really sure if you are meant to laugh or it is genuinely seriously but director Stephen Chow intertwine both together to create some weird humour but it just works.Another part of the charm of the unique comedy is this movie is the surprisingly over the top slapstick, Looney tunes comedy. The director employs this by using very cartooney sound effects and having guys get hit around like toy ragdolls that result in some laugh out moments. There is a chase scene that feels like it is from Bugs Bunny. I don't want to spoil any of the moments if you haven't watched it but it's as crazy as it sounds and it's awesome.This movie isn't just all comedy though and has some amazing fight/action scenes. The director uses a lot of wirework and surprisingly a lot of CGI which is quite unprecedented in a martial art or even a comedy movie but it is used very effectively. The fight scenes are well directed and edited but best of all incredibly exciting and thrilling to watch. Despite all the wirework and CGI, every fight is completely visible with no over edits or shaky cam and in 2004 that was quite rare in action movies.The movie was undoubtedly inspired by many American movies such as The Matrix, Spiderman and even The Shining. The director incorporates these very blatant references in the movie to the point that it seems like it is copying but yet it feels unique due to how the director utilises it.All the actors in this movie are great including the director, Stephen Chow, who plays the main lead. Every actor including supporting actors embody the ridiculous nature and manage to stand apart from each other that even in the short runtime of 98 minutes, the audience can grasp every single character's personality and quirkiness in minutes. The set design is amazing as it represents the 1940's Shanghai and feels vibrant and alive. The costumes are great as they feel believable and manage to capture the personality of some of the characters. The score by Raymond Wong is incredible and captures the nature of the movie with one of the stand out being the Axe Gang music which will make you want to dance with it.If there had to be a flaw in the movie then it has to be the lack of a coherent plot. The synopsis is the basic premise for the beginning of the movie but a lot of other different plot points happen to intertwine with this about other characters and then there is this other new plot happening in the third act which makes it feel incoherent. Another flaw would be the lack or very rushed character development which is in part due to its short runtime. Characters can completely change in personality in a matter of minutes without any real build-up towards it.Bill Murray described this movie as ""the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy"" and honestly that is a fair assessment. I feel like there will never be another movie like this ever. The movie blends kung fu, CGI and cartooney humour to create what I consider is one of the most hilarious movies ever made. If you haven't watched it then I HIGHLY recommend you give this movie a watch!",Kung Fu Hustle

128,d_art,Zany...and amazing....,10,8 May 2005,"Few weeks ago, my friends and I went to see Kung Fu Hustle. Previous work I've seen by director Stephen Chow was Shaolin Soccer. I recall upon arrival of the DVD I got from YesAsia.com several years ago, I've been showing around that DVD to my friends (along with My Sassy Girl). Needless to say, I thought the flick was hilarious and the use of CG as a storytelling tool was breathtaking. The previous movie before Shaolin Soccer where I saw CG working to its benefit was Storm Riders. Story wasn't built around the CG aspects but the CG made the story better. Wacky imaginations just come alive in CG form. And, generally, that's what Kung Fu Hustle is all about. Stephen Chow doesn't hold anything back, but throws tons of conventions and cartoonish humor with dazzling look and pazzazz. Here, he paints the movie using genre conventions as his brushstroke--a man who obviously loves the Kung Fu genre, sappy love stories, and cartoonish wackiness. The slapstick in the film work mostly because they are CGs done with great artistic delivery. The scenes are also beautifully lighted and shot. The action scenes are dazzling. Overall, it's a very well-done comedy with lots and lots of imagination. If there is any fault with this movie (it's not really a fault, really), it would be that, as a story, it's not as well-structured as Shaolin Soccer. In Shaolin Soccer for example, you can generally see things being set up (bad guys are introduced, etc) and they will all somehow come together. Kung Fu Hustle is somewhat less predictable and some things come out of left field, often in a good way, and in some cases, odd ways. But, hey, one has to realize it is a comedy and that already allows it to have its own rules. Did it work as a whole? If you don't like it, you will at least appreciate it for its virtuoso film-making.",Kung Fu Hustle
129,c-kelsall,"Misguided, wide-of-the-mark comedy martial arts",2,9 November 2005,"Kung Fu Hustle tells the story of an epic battle between the miscellaneous inhabitants of a slum and the organised city gangsters. An uneasy truce is broken by the actions of a wannabe gangster and his sidekick, but the conflict escalates out of control, until it becomes a battle for honour, pride and survival. Kung Fu Hustle represents Stephen Chow's second mainstream directorial project, and the first one to ""break in"" to the Western market. It's distribution success happened off the back of word-of-mouth acclaim for his earlier film, Shaolin Soccer. Unfortunately, where the latter was hilarious, Hustle falls dreadfully wide-of-the-mark on almost every gag. I only found one joke in the whole film genuinely funny, a scene involving some extremely inept knife-throwing. Almost as though the film-makers knew the jokes were failing, they attempted to fill the gap with CGI. Sadly, this only serves to emphasise how much the film is lacking in other areas. The CGI is of itself quite impressive, but it forms far too much of a role here to serve merely as a story-telling tool. The plot is incoherent and comprises nothing more than a seemingly endless string of fight sequences that would largely have benefited from more attention to choreography and far less to CGI. By the end of the film I was pondering how to get back the 95 minutes of my life that had been wasted watching the least entertaining martial arts film I've seen in years.",Kung Fu Hustle

The film manages to work on so many levels, necessitating for all those viewing it. The essence of humanity and nobility is encapsulated throughout this story in a truly creative yet very simple manner. This is in turn fused with comic moments throughout the film which give it a traditional, and very effective, feel good factor. Which is exactly the wonderful thing about this film, is that it hits its targets plot-wise, precisely. What you expect to happens does happen, but perhaps in a different way than you thought. Stephen Chow, always elongates the plot revelation for a little longer than we're used to in this part of the world, and it is that which provides for engrossing cinema. Kung-Fu, contains that zany feel of ""Shaolin Soccer"", with Mr Chow amiable and convincing as his usual buffoonish characters, and yet also able to carry the serious side, ensuring the viewing audience connect with this film. Utter Brilliance. 'Shaolin' was very entertaining, but in a different way to this outing. Shoalin was out and out humour, it's subsidiary plot not as strong as the encapsulating football (or rather soccer for some), leaving it to be more of a tradition comedy-film. Kung-Fu is an action-comedy, in many senses of the word, but that's not enough, it contains the utter height of ""coolness"" in a very Die Hardish sense, yet leaves you emotive, much like the first time you finished watching Episode I. In tears. There aren't enough alliterative puns to make about this films, it's far too enjoyable to simply dissect, which makes it very hard to end a summary. It's just good. Very good.",Kung Fu Hustle
135,jmverville,Kung Fu With Mass Appeal,8,28 May 2005,"Upon hearing about this film I became skeptical of the idea of a comedy based around Kung Fu, and I worried that a good job would not be done and that it would be quite a struggle to enjoy with the drama mixed in. I was proved wrong -- I found that the film was magniciently sequenced from beginning to end, with very interesting and innovative fight scenes, as well as with the proper comic relief.The acting was very professional and genuine, with the characters being portrayed well. It was easy to become sucked into the story with the terrific acting of everyone involved.The story was top, with each new twist and turn making me more interested in the plot of the film as a whole. When the film ended, I was left fulfilled with the story and quite excited about the whole ordeal, hoping that more work along these lines would be done in the future. A tremendous triumph for cinema.",Kung Fu Hustle
136,pookey56,kung fu-ing hilarious!,9,12 November 2005,"my friendly neighbourhood video store manager recommended this film to me and so i rented it, since he's never steered me wrong before. the packaging claims the film has a ""Tarantino-like"" quality to it. but what decided it for me was that i recognized the choreographer; the same man who choreographed CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON, Woo Ping Yuen. and to my surprise, i thoroughly enjoyed this movie. it DID have a Tarantino-like edge to it. it also had a touch of The Matrix, and a pinch of the romance in Braveheart, and the magical quality we saw in Crouching Tiger. this movie had me belly-laughing, it was so funny! a self-parody, it mixes fantasy, comedy, and great action sequences very well and has a magical quality as i said that i really appreciated. i found it unconventional, touching, and absolutely HILARIOUS. subtitled in English, these movies have come a long long way from the chop-sake films i used to take in in the seventies in Chinese theatres where the subtitling was unintentionally hilarious. Kung-Fu Hustle wasn't a one-note film. it covered a number of territories and covered them surprisingly well. if you've never seen a Chinese action film before, and are used to Jackie Chan films, you may not know what to make of this film. but i can almost guarantee that it will make you laugh out loud. great cast with uniquely drawn characters, great un-stereotyped hero, sweet heroine, flying martial arts, Shakespearean ""aside"" characters, fantasy, terrific comedy, and an abrupt ending. i found myself wishing for more. all in all, completely enjoyable.",Kung Fu Hustle

I replied ""Like Matrix meets Crouching Tiger and the Three Stooges"". It was everything merged into this new Kung Fu style. Dancing bad guys in the style of the Sinatra era, fantastic visual effects and just the right amount of comedy to morph it into what could already be considered a classic in it's genre. There's nothing more fun than a Chow movie in this respect. I'd love to see him continue to re-invent the classic style into something new like this. More people will be turned on to a new brand of film-making mixed with an old style.",Kung Fu Hustle
138,MinorityReporter,I was still laughing to myself an hour after I saw it!,8,25 November 2005,"This film is freaking hilarious! I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard. Afterwards I wanted to tell people how funny it was but every time I tried I would start laughing again simply from thinking about it. Stephen Chow is incredibly funny and talented. Its hard to write why the film is funny without spoiling it but I'll give it my best shot because Kong Fu Hustle deserves to be seen without having any preconceived notions about it.The principal actors are all very funny and have great sense of timing and even though I saw the film subtitled it didn't make it any worse. Especially Stephen Chow is funny and both his posture, facial expressions and general timing is high above average. I also like the fact that he has a high degree of self-irony and is not afraid to let the joke be on him, which pretty much all the jokes in the film are. Among other actors worth mentioning are Wah Yuen who plays the landlord and Qiu Yuen who plays the landlady. They both seem enthusiastic about the project. The supporting cast is pretty good as well.The acting is not in the high seat, however. Obviously the main attraction is the action and all action scenes are brilliant. They are executed in a very stylish and aesthetic manner and are also very, very funny. There are scenes that were just beautiful and left me breathless but they never lose the self-irony which is so incredibly well executed and are therefore also incredibly entertaining. Much more than in other Hong Kong action movies like Hero, which in my opinion could have done with a dose of self-irony. The computer effects are blatantly obvious but they still seem pretty believable within the confines of the film universe and they are generally very well done. Also I found the burly brawl sequence to be incredible and it had me in stitches. Overall the effects and fight scenes make the film very worthwhile and therefore highly recommendable.Overall Kong Fu Hustle is an incredible achievement in film making and everyone who is not afraid to see the Hong Kong action genre spoofed should definitely watch it.8/10",Kung Fu Hustle

140,Scorching,Better than Shaolin Soccer!,7,16 February 2005,"Stephen Chow's last project ""Shaolin Soccer"" was a funny and enjoyable and as a result of that I expected to enjoy his next project Kung-Fu Hustle. I got to say that I was NOT disappointed with his one. So much so that I like this even more than soccer. The humour was not over the top like other comedies. Despite it being in Chinese with sub-titles did not in anyway deter me from enjoying the movie. It really was able to cross both the cultural and lingual barrier which may exist in foreign films.I particularly loved all the references that were made to famous American movies like the Matrix and Spiderman. They were delivered in a subtle but effective way. Also despite his rather limited screen time Chow made up for it by delivering quality inputs from behind the camera. The characters were both lovable and detestable. I especially loved the couple who were very ironic.Overall a quality followup to SS. I cannot wait for his next project.",Kung Fu Hustle
141,stargunner,"Pokes fun, makes sense, kicks ass.",10,14 May 2005,"I don't know where to start with this movie. My expectations were blown away. In fact, I wasn't sure what to expect. But let me tell you that the experience was worth more than my disgustingly overpriced admission. With the popcorn and drink on top of it.Perhaps i'll start with the least important element of the movie. Firstly, Kung Fu Hustle has officially replaced all other overblown martial arts films by a long shot. The fighting in this movie is spectacular. Half the fights are so loaded with creativity it makes fighting movies look like something you've seen for the first time. The CG is great. The other half are part parodies of other films, and they are hilarious as well as spectacular. In fact, I need to see this a second time because there are a ton of movie references in it I don't think I've caught yet. Depending on your library of watched films, you'll catch more of them. I got quite a few and they were well done.And here's the most important part about this movie. This is where Kung Fu Hustle succeeds where so many other martial arts movies fail. It has a believable, simple, touching, intertwined and well flowing story. I can't tell you how many times where I've walked out of a martial arts - or even action - movie, and been immensely disappointed because the fighting and explosions were great, but the rest of it simply fell short. These movies are typically way unbalanced.But Stephen Chow is talented enough to take both elements of the movie to their rightful place. I don't know how he did it, but it worked. The acting is incredibly enjoyable. The plot is likable. The fighting will make your jaw drop. And all the fighting actually has something to do with the story. It's absolutely amazing.If you're tired of action movies not making the mark, go see this one. Now. 10/10.",Kung Fu Hustle
142,cb_whitewood,Wild and so fun!,7,31 January 2021,"Went into watching this with a vague idea of what it was, but the stunts and banter in this were even more than I had hoped for. The fight scenes are tense yet fun, and I loved the variety in characters. I think the opening scene with the Axe Gang is one that I'll never forget, loved their dance. My only wish is that there was a bit more depth to the protagonist, even though we see the resolution of his story arc. Otherwise, a very entertaining watch.",Kung Fu Hustle
143,pandabat,Most original rip-off ever!!!,8,15 April 2005,"I went to see this movie early one Saturday morning as part of a local film festival. I had generally avoided modern martial arts movies and the pain which the 'Kill Bill' movies had brought to me had convinced me that I was right to do so. It was only the fact that I had seen the excellent 'Zatooichi' which kept any interest in the genre alive for me at all.It's hard to describe the 'Kung Fu Hustle' experience as a whole. Those who have seen other Stephen Chow works, such as 'Shaolin Soccer', will recognise styles, elements and even actors that they have seen before but this movie takes all of those to a higher level of professionalism, production quality and all-round enjoyment.For those unaware of the plot, 'Kung Fu Hustle' tells the tale of a small town crook and his sidekick who wish to make the big time by joining the Axe Gang, the biggest and best crime gang in town. The Axe Gang, meanwhile, have become embroiled in a more than minor dispute with a local flats complex known as 'the Pig Sty'. Sounds standard enough but the production, pace and imagination of this movie will have you hooked within minutes.Sound and music play a big part in the audience's immersion into the world of 'Kung Fu Hustle'. Watching the Axe Gang's co-ordinated, choreographed victory dance at the beginning will have you bemused and intrigued at the same time and on throughout the movie the impact of sound and the great use of appropriate music will never skip a beat ensuring the experience is never broken or jarred for the audience.Picture of course is what cinema is largely about and there are no disappointments here. The tone set early on is that of a cartoon and in the respect of the special effects and the depth of the colours used on-screen, this film remains faithful to that.The story barrels along and the script seems sharp although, as this is a movie you'll be watching through the medium of subtitles, it is hard to tell if the original script was this biting for western audiences or whether the translators really knew their action movies and slotted in the best replacements for dialogue that you could possibly imagine. In any case, the movie will have you laughing with both it's original jokes and constant nods to action classics such as 'The Untouchables', 'Spiderman' and 'The Matrix'.Looking at the ingredients on their own, there's nothing especially new. Where this movie differs is that, as far as I know, no-one has previously combined such high quality production, with superb action sequences and with such top-notch humour and it is in this respect, that 'Kung Fu Hustle' is much more than the sum of its parts.I left the cinema aghast at and disbelieving, both in a good way, what I had just seen. I await the general release of this movie, which unfortunately is another few months away, just so I can see it again on the big screen. When this movie comes your way, make sure you do the same. I'm positive that you won't be disappointed!",Kung Fu Hustle

145,joeshoe89,Great action comedy with something for everyone,9,15 April 2005,I watched this movie on DVD back to back with the dts DVD of Oldboy. I thought this was the much much better DVD. Not only was the movie fun and action filled the stylized cartoon actions of the characters added to the enjoyment altogether. I really liked the way certain sly references were made to other films (ie with great power comes great responsibility)and the whole story of the mute girl and the hero as children in my opinion pays as much homage to the classic kung fu films of the past as the inclusion of the great stars of the past being in the cast. I have to say the sound on my home system was superb! Not only did the music and various sound effects move perfectly from front to back and side to side even tiny things like the tinkling of the metal rings on a character's wrists was both clear and almost wind chime like. This movie should have been in dts! A great job by the filmmakers and DVD makers.,Kung Fu Hustle
146,terrellrobinson71,"I love this movie! If you've seen ""Crouching Tiger"" and ""Kill Bill"", then, dude, you ain't seen nothing yet!",10,26 February 2012,"I am a huge admirer of the comic genius Stephen Chow. The three movies that were released in America, ""Shaolin Soccer"", ""Kung Fu Hustle"" and ""CJ7"" were strange but hilarious in its own way. (""CJ7"" and ""Shaolin Soccer"" were more family-oriented than ""Kung Fu Hustle"") With ""Kung Fu Hustle"", Chow became an overnight success that made American audiences knew who this guy was, if they didn't know his earlier films. Beware though, ""Kung Fu Hustle"" is rated R for ""sequences of strong stylized action and violence"", but this is a PG-13-rated film for sure. (It's better suited for 13 & up, if they get the wacky style of violence and its humor) The movie is set in 1930's China, where the most popular gangs (i.e: the Axe Gang) rule and took what was theirs (money, women, cars) and a rundown slum called ""Pig Sty Alley"" had nothing but limited water access, food services and paying for rent. All that changes when a wannabe punk named Sing (Stephen Chow) and his sidekick Bone (Lam Tze Chung) enters the slum. Sing desperately wants to be a part of the Axe Gang, but he is rather dim-witted and a bit crazy. Of course, like any other slum, ""Pig Sty Alley"" has its secrets, like the Landlady (Yuen Qiu) and Landlord (Yuen Wah) used to be the Kung Fu masters of the ""Lion's Roar"" and the ""Bendable Twisting Snake"", until they had a son who died and they ran the slum to remain in peace forever. Like any other character trying to be bad, but turns out to be good, Sing is saved by a deaf-mute girl Fong (Shengyi Huang) who was rescued by him years ago and now runs a vendor for ice cream. When Sing does become a part of the Axe Gang, his first mission: to free a legendary killer known as the Beast (Siu-Lung Leung) in order to defeat the Landlady and Landlord. I won't say anything else here, because there are a lot of surprises to found in this movie. The fight choreography done by the legendary Yuen Wo-Ping (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Kill Bill: Volumes 1 & 2) is awesome, hilarious and highly inventive. It's designed to be more like cartoons like ""Looney Tunes"" with the combination of Jackie Chan and Quentin Tarantino. Stephen Chow as a writer, director and actor accomplishes what was impossible but made it possible breaking the laws of gravity in every way. The term for a movie like ""Kung Fu Hustle"" is weird, but trust me you'll crack up that funny bone of yours soon enough. This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Don't believe me?

149,faincut,Cartoonish Parody of Kung Fu,8,28 May 2005,"""Kung Fu Hustle"" (China/Hong Kong, 2004, 99 Min.) A Review by Jonathan FainWhen you want to make an innovative film and don't have a clue where to begin, you can always have a mix. Kung Fu Hustle is huge mix of genres, leading to a tasty shake of comedy/parody/action/Kung-Fu movie. Added with a little musical dance and a CGI cartoon like scenes and you got it - a mix - which luckily comes out very well, as the recipe is good and ""bartender"" is very talented.Sing (Stephan Chow) wants to be a gang member of the ""Axe Gang"". The gang rules the city and the police is bribed to serve the gang. Sing tries to disguise as a gang member trying to rob an innocent looking neighborhood. However, they only appear innocent as they are all Kung Fu masters (Even the little child). Sing sets the gang on the neighborhood, but the bad guys appear to be losers, just like the coyote scheming plans to try and catch the Road Runner as they get hit over and over, just like the cartoon.So we have some cartoon like scenes. Other scenes resemble The Matrix, with cable operated maneuvers and punches that smash porcelain, or 1000 people get kicked high in the air which looks like Matrix Reloaded.Movie Highlights:* Sing using the knife stabbed on him as rear-view mirror to see his chaser.* The gay hairdresser - stereotypical.* The sitting tall fighter and the masculine child - great joke.* The kids pissing on young Sing - cruel and strong scene.Maybe in English this movie would be appreciated and received better by the audience, as the Chinese is a hard to follow even if subtitled.--- ""Kung Fu Hustle"" (China/Hong Kong, 2004, 99 Min.)

150,abentenjo,Side-Splitting Hijinks with the Asian King of Comedy...,9,17 May 2005,"We're introduced to the Axe Gang, a mass army of suited henchmen who command sway over the hotspots of 1920s China, with a brutal slaying worthy of Scorsese. They summarily break off into a choreographed dance routine over the opening credits, and it's clear that we're back in Stephen Chow's world. In the provincial towns, a burly landlady screams at her tenants with such force the ground shudders and the windows smash. An Axe Gang leader is given a bad hairstyle by one of the town's folk, and soon the whole village is under attack. Sing (Chow) wants to be an Axe because 'being a bad guy is cool'; he helps the protagonists get the 'Beast' out of a mental asylum so he can defeat the screaming landlady and her dithering spouse in kung fu combat. Chow's inspiration is as much Western as it is Eastern, with obligatory Bruce Lee parodies in tow alongside brilliant takes on Gangs of New York and The Matrix. The madcap surrealism of Shaolin Soccer is at the film's heart, but the greater scale of this production (partly financed by American money) dictates a much more polished, accomplished piece: Chow's maturity as a director has blossomed, the sets/costumes/characters are vividly imaginative, while the pace of the humour is expertly complimented by a much more sinister, darker overtone, something Chow seems to have embraced full heartedly. While Chow the comedian has never looked better; with a heavy endorsement of CGI responsible for the more irreverent comedy, Chow's performance sees him fine-tune his Chaplinesque timing, cuddly dexterity and Bruce Lee intensity to absolute perfection, underlining the fact that if Hong Kong comedy has any future at all, its firmly up to the fate of Stephen Chow. This is a delightful kung fu romp. If you don't find something to love about this movie then you should check if you're still breathing.",Kung Fu Hustle

The film has a unique humor and doesn't take itself too seriously.

I would even say that Kung Fu Hustle is a more refined Shoalin Soccer in terms of storyline, action sequences and acting.The setting is great with some nice scenes of old Hong Kong and the way people used to live.

I tried to get past it though.The trailer makes it look like pretty much any other martial arts movie. In that sense it's wildly misleading. Kung Fu Hustle doesn't really have a strong story, but the story it does have doesn't particularly matter too much. It's all about the visuals and the hilarity.It's pretty brilliant though. It manages to be quite violent and stupidly hilarious at the same time. The film's opening manages to include crime, gangs, amputation and dancing, all within the first two minutes.It doesn't really take itself too seriously and the landlady is a brilliant piece of casting, she's may be the funniest thing in this movie. The chase sequence between her and Sing is both hilarious and amazing. The CGI is pretty great too, although some of it is done awfully for comedic effect, like Sing's swollen lips.It even manages to spoof Spiderman by quoting ""with great power comes great responsibility"". I love the scene with the string instrument. It's so ridiculously stupid and yet extremely clever and entertaining that they use sonic waves as a weapon.

A lot of the movie was quite far-fetched but it didn't really matter because it all fitted in very nicely with the mood and atmosphere of the film.There were some great characters in the film, all of the main roles were superb, especially the land-lady who was constantly smoking cigarettes.The only criticism I really have is that the ending was a little O.T.T, even compared with the rest of the film and was extremely far-fetched.This is a film I would recommend to anyone, I will definitely be giving it another look soon.",Kung Fu Hustle
163,omega145,"Fight scenes are excellent, story and comedy are fairly mediocre",6,21 September 2020,I watched this movie years ago and just didn't get it. I found most of the fight scenes very well done but the story to be over the top silly and really not that enjoyable. I decided to give this another go this past weekend and wonder if maybe i'd like it more with another watch.I definitely did not and found myself again only enjoying the few fight scenes. The one scene with the Zither instrument is fantastic and far and away the most memorable scene for me in the movie. The other fight scenes are also well done but the comedy is just not that funny to me. A few laughable moments but the story is not well done and a majority of the humor didn't hit.I guess Stephen Chow films just aren't for me.,Kung Fu Hustle
164,bLuR-7,A rollicking good time,10,5 August 2007,"While the name Stephen Chow might barely elicit a hint of recognition among Western audiences, there's no denying he's a legend back in his home turf of Hong Kong. His films are often characterized by their zany characters, over-the-top action scenes and eye-popping (sometimes literally!) special effects. His earlier works, such as God of Cookery and Shaolin Soccer, were uneven escapist fluff-pieces that were weighed down by a tinge of superfluousness. With Kung Fu Hustle, however, Chow managed to find his footing, creating a film that manages to rise above its genre conventions to become a veritable piece of cinematic artistry. Part action film, part love story, part loving homage, Hustle is a pitch-perfect example of the best that Hong Kong cinema has to offer, effortlessly mixing digital wizardry with old-school martial arts stunts while never skipping a comedic beat. Starring Chow himself as a hapless wannabe gangster embroiled in a head-spinning battle between the notoriously violent Axe Gang and the high-flying residents of a slum called Pig Sty. The kung fu masters from the ramshackle village are faced with the task of thwarting the dastardly attacks of the Axe Gang, which include a band of suited axe-wielding mercenaries, a pair of string-strumming assassins and a prison-abducted supervillain known as The Beast, fast enough to catch a speeding bullet. All this climaxes into an go-for-broke showdown between the newly enlightened Chow and the malevolent Beast. And if that's not reason enough for you to rush to your nearest video store, Chow peppers the film with nods to everything from Looney Tunes slapstick to Kubrickian surrealism, as well as an inspired reimagining of the 'Burly Brawl' sequence from The Matrix Reloaded. A true gem!",Kung Fu Hustle
165,utpal_das,One of the all time instant classics BUT like nothing you have ever seen before,10,15 April 2018,"There has been no movie like this, none. Period. Shoalin Soccer was brilliant,but this is something else.The character development is so rich that you will be wanting more, from the lecherous landlord, to the side kick of the bad guy and the side kick of the hero, from the mega villain to the local Juliet, from the land lady to the 2 vile playing the piano, even if they got a few scenes, everyone stole the limelight. In fact, Stephen Chow's character probably looked less interesting at times.The scene where his sidekick accidentally hits him with a knife followed by kissing a cobra is the ultimate funny sceneThee are so so so many good to better to brilliant scenes from all the characters that you would probably see it nth number of times.The slapstick is bang on, the over-the-top scenes are even more bang on, everyone is in top notch form.It is mostly over-the-top but what a balance Stephen Chow has maintained! NOT EVEN ONCE does it cross the line to become even remotely senseless. This is miles ahead of anything you have seen, in fact a different genre needs to be specially made just to fit this movie. This one, Shaolin Soccer and CJ7 are proof enough that Chow is a superior director, but i doubt he can top this. There is just no equal. It is like the Psycho of thrillers, The Enter the Dragon of Martial Arts, The Terminator 2 of Action movies, With this movie alone, Chow should be ranked as an all time great.",Kung Fu Hustle
166,Zombie-Kermit,"Whether you are an action fan or a comedy fan, watch this movie.",9,14 May 2008,"You know those movies that you know nothing about? I think I only saw one poster or something for it before I decided to see it. I needed to pass some time before Land of the Dead, and I though ""What they hey? I like kung-fu movies... should be entertaining."" That may have been the understatement of the year. I don't think I had ever laughed as hard in a theater as I did with this movie. Heck, I don't think I've laughed that hard since.The story revolves mostly around a failure of a criminal named Sing, played by director Stephen Chow. Some of the other main characters are the Landlord and Landlady of Pig Sty Alley, as well as the evil Axe Gang and of course the Beast. All of the characters are great and memorable.The story is very cartoony in some parts, yet also a lot darker in others. There are heaps of memorable scenes such as the knife throwing incident and the fights against the Axe Gang. I've heard of it described as Looney Tunes meets Kill Bill.... I would have to say that is a pretty good way of summing it up.And now onto the fighting. Man, it's awesome. It contains many of my favourite live action fights scenes I would have to say. Trust me, if you're looking for really cool looking fights, look no further than this movie.There's some good character development in the story to.This is a movie where Stephen Chow truly shows off every talent a director could have. Camedy, Drama, Action and of course random pop culture references.Also, if you like this movie you should also check out one of Chow's earlier movies, the awesome Shaolin Soccer. It's done in pretty much the same kind of style, except a lot zanier.There's not really much more I can say about this title except it's one of my favourite movies, and I would gladly recommend it to fans of the genre, or even someone who's never seen a kung-fu movie before.10/10",Kung Fu Hustle
167,Simarium,Kung Fu Hustle,3,2 August 2018,"I'm really not a fan of these types of movies. The plot was so weak I could barely identify it until the end, and it was just too over-the-top for me to enjoy it much.",Kung Fu Hustle
168,PiranianRose,"Falling in love with HK cinema, all over again",10,30 March 2005,"Stephen Chow Sing Chi's Kung Fu Hustle may be the most satisfying film-going experience that Hong Kong film enthusiasts have dreamed for in recent years. Some viewers may attribute KF Hustle's greatness to Hong Kong film industry's lack of quality production in recent years, thus enabling KF Hustle to shine through. I don't see it this way. I believe the film's success owes mostly, if not entirely, to its own merits.I grew up watching Hong Kong (HK) movies. When I was a kid, I cherished what I saw on the screen--being a child was great, and HK cinema was larger than life to me. As I entered adolescence, I lost most of what I cherished: action sequences that once took my breath away started looking cheesy compared to the latest blockbuster; revered performances started to pale as they were mimicked. As I understood more about life and how movies were made, I never saw movies the same way again; I became more critical, and I thought the joy of becoming one with the movie would be lost forever.Yet I rediscovered this joy in Kung Fu Hustle, perhaps for the first time since childhood. Why is KF Hustle able to deliver the joy of pure entertainment to a broad range of audiences, from innocent kids to mature grown-ups? That is to say, how could watching KF Hustle enable an adult such as myself to take a trip back to childhood, remembering what it was like to truly cherish a film? I believe this is the result of several important elements employed by the film: firstly, Stephen Chow in making a film in the new millennium has not forgotten the old ways. The scenes in Pig Sty Alley employ a background score reminiscent to those in traditional martial arts films from decades before. In addition, Chow selects several classic kung fu actors as homage to the golden days of the genre (including Bruce Liang {Beast}--one of several Bruce Lee clones in the 70s who is perhaps most remembered for his roles in Fist of Fury and Legendary Fok TV series, and long-time sidekick Yuen Wah {Landlord}). These slick blast from the past strike a chord with older audiences while still managing to be refreshing to the young.Another element that makes this movie such a tour-de-force is the transcendence above genre conventions. KF Hustle embodies the quality of a martial arts feature, a comedy, an action flick, and occasionally borderlines a sci-fi/fantasy/special effects extravaganza. In fact, KF Hustle is ALL of this and NONE of it. What it is is nonstop exciting and unpredictable entertainment the whole way through, never letting audience involvement slip. When there's action, you never want to blink for a second; when the action isn't on, there is always comedy, suspense, or complex drama to keep us involved.In my book, Stephen Chow in crafting Kung Fu Hustle has reached the peak of perfection in film-making. In the ride, I was able to suspend my belief and FEEL Chow's magical world, the very same way I entered the universe of my fondest childhood films without critiquing little details, and that is just what we need sometimes.[10/10]",Kung Fu Hustle

I have read some of the other reviews here, and they describe the film's story elements in detail, so there's no need for me to go into that territory. I would like to add some of my own colors, however. As a matter of fact, I walked out of this film smiling, and pretty well satisfied. I have seen a good bit of imported Chinese cinema, not a lot, but I know the basic product, which allowed me to sit through this feeling less shock, I think, than the people sitting around me. Had I not been so schooled, I think my reaction would've been a lot like theirs: It was really a joy to listen to these people.For the first hour they laughed and gasped, because the gags and the action were so relentless, so over the top.And once they were through with the first hour, and realized that they still had another hour to go, and that the pacing and intensity were not going to let up, they all fell into a stupefied, stunned, TOTAL silence. They were just flat-out overwhelmed. Absolutely dumbfounded, every one of them! So the movie finished up, and slowly they all filed out, still wordless.I never heard one of them say a gol-darned thing past that one-hour mark.So, yes, if, based on the trailers and the poster art, you think this is your cup of tea, by all means, do go see it, it is an entertainment.",Kung Fu Hustle

But man oh man, Chow did it again impressing me even more. This is totally insane, hilarious and just pure fun and entertainment. I don't know about some people but if you don't find that throwing of 3 knives scene hilarious then you got some issues. Don't take the movie too seriously expecting philosophical idealistic projection of life's depth, because if you are, run along. Fortunately I'm one of the millions of people who perceive Chow's humor to be funny, but of course not everyone can understand the style and brand of his comic performance. Nevertheless all we ask is to put your critical minds aside and enjoy this kung fu masterpiece.I love the martial arts, the insane take on super-fu, slap stick comedy mixed along with showing the reality of average peoples lives. Cultural barriers may occur when people from all over the world see this, but as I said, don't take it critical nor seriously and your guaranteed to enjoy this gem.

175,info-2513,This movie will blow you away!,10,3 February 2005,"In the wildly imaginative and action-packed Kung Fu Hustle, petty thief Sing (Stephen Chow) aspires to be a ruthless gangster. Stumbling across a gang-controlled apartment to extort money from the locals who are actually kung fu masters in disguise. Sing's actions attracts the notorious Axe Gang, and set off a relentless chain of events that brings the clans together in an explosive battle.From kung fu showdowns to dance sequences featuring tuxedoed mobsters, you've never seen martial arts action this outrageous! With jaw-dropping fight sequences by Yeun Wo Ping (famed action choreographer of Kill Bill Vol.1 & 2 and The Matrix) Kung Fu Hustle will blow you away! Chow's movie is set in 1940s Guangdong Province, China. Chow plays Ah-xing, a street rascal who fools around constantly. He is good at talking glibly, but at the core he is feeble-minded and stuck in poverty with an unknown future. So, it doesn't look good for A-xing at the beginning of the movie.It doesn't get any better, either a little later as we discover it is A-xing's goal is to become a member of the notorious Axe Gang, the fiercest, cruelest and most widespread gang of the city.One day when A-xing goes into a slum, Pig Cage Town, to do his usual extortion, he witnesses a real clash between two gangs: the Axe Gang is clearing out a local gang that has not shown allegiance to the Axe. A-xing realizes the slum residents -- including the plump landlady and her skinny and wimpy-looking husband -- have each turned into kung-fu masters to fight against the large group of gangs.A-xing then realizes this is a battle between good and evil and that he is called to choose one side.Stephen Chow continues his unique comedy style, twisting the slapstick jokes and reinterpreting them with his composed face. In Kung Fu Hustle, Chow intensifies the self-torture sequences and creates more funny points in his suffering. For example, when Chow shows his characters practising kung-fu while faced by a middle-aged woman in the slum, he is quickly kicked in the groin. He is also stabbed by three flying daggers which were supposedly aimed at his enemy and is later bitten in the face by two poisonous snakes. Through all these trials he manages to survive for another day.Apart from creativity, Kung Fu Hustle has also demonstrated a higher quality comedy than his early 1990s works such as Fight Back to School (1991) and King of Beggars (1992). The cinematography is more sophisticated, with an authentic 1930s aura. And like Shaolin Soccer, Kung Fu Hustle heavily adopts computer graphics to present special effects such as the snake, daggers and flying axes.",Kung Fu Hustle

The choreography is actually super sick and it's overall pretty realistic. I love this movie from the insides of my heart and you will too I promise. Seriously I wish there was a 100/10 because I would give it that. These are words nobody would say about this movie.This is just a disaster, but I don't care. If you want a movie that's horrible that you can watch with your friends and make fun of the plot, this is it. The story itself is just all over the place and terrible, but that's kind of its charm. I think there were like 9 different protagonists that just kept going back and forth. As far as the setting goes, there are about 4 different areas our characters visit, but who cares? I'm actually not kidding about the fight scenes though, those are actually really cool.Anyways, 10/10. It was a disaster but I can't say I didn't enjoy it. If you love a good laugh or do commentary stuff, watch this movie. It's not even a Christmas movie but watch this on Christmas because it's a gift from Jesus.

178,robertllr,"If you don't like this film, you haven't been to the movies enough!",10,6 March 2006,"""Kung Fu Hustle"" is a movie-lovers movie. It is also a nearly perfect film. A terrific parody of action-film makingpast and presentwhile at the same time being just as slick and glossy as those modern films themselves. There are plenty of computer- generated special effects, but Chow choreographs some brilliant, straight-ahead stuff as well, with plain old stop-action and clever cutting to thrill us, not just with the slam bam, but with the pleasure of a subtly used camera as well.Some, but by no means all, of the films and film styles that Chow simultaneously roasts and pays homage too include, in order of most heavily drawn from include: Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon A Time In The West,"" the Italian director's broad, operatic, and slightly surreal epic of good, evil, and revenge in frontier America.The so-called ""Chinese sword movie"" of the late 60's and early 70's. This genre is not to be confused with the pale and anemic contemporary versions, such as ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon."" The Taiwanese productions of the earlier era were meant strictly for Chinese audiences. Only a few dedicated art houses and the public theaters in the Chinatowns of America's big cities ever showed these films. They had plenty of razzle dazzle and fantasy-style fight scenes; but the plots of these early Asian films were complex and clearly drawn from the rich Chinese mythology, with literary-quality characterizations, themes and plot construction.The slapstick and pratfall-laden ""action comedies"" of the silent eratypified best of course, by the films of Chaplin, Keaton, and Lloyd.Chuck Jones and his classic Roadrunner cartoonsbrilliantly recreated in a live-action sequence that had me doubled over on the floor.Contemporary, humorless, overly-special-effects-driven drivel like ""The Matrix,"" and the afore-mentioned ""Crouching Tiger."" The wonderful musicals of Fred Astair. And if the homage isn't clear, there is actually a scene where two actors are locked in a villain/victim embrace in front of a poster advertising an Astair/Rogers flick in which the postures of the two dancers parallel the ones in the foregrounda treat of directorial reference that lasts but a few seconds.The films of independent director Hal Hartleywhere characters are suddenly and inexplicably (and briefly) placed in a chorus line for a brief dance that is essentially unrelated to the film.Gangster movies of the forties, and--at least in once scene""The Godfather."" Chow even manages to work some heart (not to say sentimentality) into a story that is mostly satiric. Stephen Chow wrote, directed, produced and starred in this thinga real wonder boy and a true heir to Chaplin, Keaton, and Harold Lloyd.If you don't like this film, you haven't been to the movies enough.",Kung Fu Hustle

Hugely disappointed at the last two movies I didn't think wire fu movies could ever be truly magnificent.And along came Kung Fu Hustle. I was amazed and in awe. There was comedy, plenty of CGI, action, drama and even a bit of horror. Stephen Chow really explores each and every bit of the action genre and even dares to mix in cartoonish action.The playfulness and honesty portrayed in this movie blends together perfectly. One part never play out the other. It's never too serious and never too silly. It's just right and you'll probably sit with a quirky smile and feel-good notion in your belly at the end of this beautiful movie.Chow's main character is probably one of the funniest portrays in a while. It's hard to describe last time we saw such presence both in acting and action sequences. It's not fair to compare him with Bruce Lee but that is the amount of presence he delivers in this movie. Bruce may have proved himself as a fighter but Stephen Chow proves himself as a creator and actor.Ultimately Kung Fu Hustle is a movie that you have to see. I've introduced it among friends and family and not one person so far has disliked it. It's a movie with a little bit of everything that anyone can enjoy.Go rent and watch it today. I'm serious.

184,fundaquayman,A disappointment after the first 30 minutes,6,28 December 2004,"Part of what makes a Stephen Chow comedy special is his ability to deliver a combination of non-sequitur humor while reminding us the harsh-realities in life. There's the betrayal by his apprentice chef in GOD OF COOKERY, the hardship of an aspiring actor in KING OF COMEDY, and the lost-cause martial artists in SHAOLIN SOCCER. What is missing with KUNG-FU HUSTLE is exactly that ingredient that made his past films so successful, and what would turn Stephen Chow into a local hero both in China and Hong Kong.To be fair, Chow had all the ingredients ready on the table, but somehow they just weren't fully utilized as they should have been. What results is a very CG-heavy film that's a cross between MATRIX, VOLCANO HIGH (2001, a Korean film directed by Kim Tae-gyun), and KILL BILL.There is greatness to homages when they are done in the right way, and KUNG FU HUSTLE seems to be full of tributes... whether it is the Tarantino tribute with the Axe-gang scenes, King-Hu with the DRAGON'S INN set-design, VOLCANO HIGH's CG-texture and feel, or even scenes reminding us of Keanu Reeve's fight-sequence with over a hundred black-suited villains in Matrix Reloaded... the list goes on, and he even throws in a Stanley Kubrick shot from THE SHINING... at one point, it's almost as if we're asked to name the movies certain scenes or shots were inspired by.Innovations? Chow broke-away from the typical Director/Actor/screenwriter formula of having the lead (i.e. chow) take up all major scenes in the story (e.g. ask yourself if you've ever watched a Jacky Chan film where he's not in almost every scene). Instead he gives ample time to the support cast of long-time-no-see martial arts experts who were at the top of their game during the 70's and early 80's. The Villain (Leung Siu-Lung) in KUNG FU HUSTLE was one of the top 'B' film stars known for his Bruce Lee-type roles 20 years ago. We haven't seen him since then, and Chow gave him a big home-coming in this film... The same also applies to the Land Lady (Yuen Chao). She was one of the few stuntwomen in Hong Kong's film industry during the 70's. If you've watched THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN(yes, a bond film), you would remember her as the butt-kicking school girl who saved Roger Moore's behind. We all know of Sammo Hung & Jacky Chan, but few of us know that she was actually trained under the same martial arts teacher as these guys since childhood.Chow had the opportunity to follow his sentimental-lead early on in the film. In the scenes when we find out who the real kung-fu masters were at PIG-STY, and how they explain they've moved to the village to get away from all the fighting and reminisce over their faded past... those were some of the best scenes in KUNG FU HUSTLE, but sadly all the potential gave way to special effects soon after. What follows is a combination of 3D-cartoon with contrived humor.As a Chow fan, like most of the audience whom I shared the theatre with, we all went to be entertained - to laugh, to feel the melancholy... but quoting a middle-aged housewife as she leaves with her husband at the end of the movie, ""It's no Shaolin Soccer."" Was this film made this way to make a better export? The minimal dialogue after the 1st act, all CG-action... basically you could turn the volume off after 30 minutes and still get what's going on... I wonder if this is a marketing decision so the film will be more easily digested overseas....Oh well, what began as the most feared competitor in HK theatres during the Xmas holidays (no other HK film wanted to be released at the same time), is at best a could-have-been-better Chow film. Hopefully his next films will once again have more weight on story and clever dialogue...that's the stuff dreams are made of, and we expect nothing less.",Kung Fu Hustle
185,foxface,Great action for the eyes,7,29 November 2005,"Kung Fu Hustle is a good film about Kung Fu, and also involves comedy, love, and Buddhist philosophy. I feel Stephen Chow did an great job with the pacing and story line. Those of you who are Matrix fans will instantly recognize the choreography and wire work of Yuen Wo Ping in the fight scenes.A lot of characters in the film could be taken at face value, but you can also get a deeper meaning. For instance, on the surface the Axe gang is just a mob, but they could also represent the oppression of working class people, or the brutality of oppression ingeneral. Sing (Chow) represents the desire of humans to transform and better themselves, even if that means joining a gang, because he wants respect. The idea of ""fate"" also weighs heavily in the movie. Fate had 5 Kung Fu masters living in the same place, but no one knew it. Sing, a mugger, is really a Kung Fu master. The film also speaks to standing up and doing the right thing. Sing makes a decision to help the landlord/landlady and fight against the beast, and winds up changing his destiny. As far as the Kung Fu, the martial arts is used to protect and defend, which is a great contrast to the violent murders committed by the Axe gang. The movie also speaks to the ""Chi"" concept an inner power or force that all individuals are supposed to possess. For example,the villains who use the lyre (musical instrument which looks like a harp for the lap) to fight against the masters, never physically touch them, yet they are using Chi,though in a negative sense, to destroy the masters. Their negative energy is represented as a force that is used for evil. Contrast that with Sing, who uses the ""Buddhist Palm"" for good and eventually tames the beast. The love story between Fong and Sing represents the strong protecting the weak. There was a lot of slap stick comedy in the movie,(Eyeglasses guy,running at high speeds)which was effective. The movie is entertaining, and it was cool to see the Axe gang get their dance on. Looking forward to the sequel.",Kung Fu Hustle

When I first saw Shaolin Soccer, I was sure this was Chinese humor at its best, but now all that glory goes to Gong Fu. It deserves a place in my top 3-4 comedies list next to Monty Python's Life of Brian, Holy Grail and Shaolin Soccer. The CG is brilliant, the acting is great, the humor is superb, there's just nothing bad I can say about Gong Fu. If you miss it, your eyes will shrivel up.",Kung Fu Hustle
187,lucas-42,Kung Fu? This is Kung Fun!,10,23 April 2005,"OK. So you've seen a lot of movies. If that's true you know most of the genres just keep imitating each other and there is a serious lack of originality. However, when watching Kung Fu Hussle, the only thing I can use to describe it is ""original."" It takes from a lot of different ideas but the overall feel of the movie is non-stop fun to the end. It's more like a Warner Bros. classic cartoon in live-action than anything... complete with Road Runner/Wile E. Coyote style chases with the feet blurred into a swirl as the chase heads down highways. The actual look of this in the film is Hilarious. There's all kinds of cartoon like violence and such, but in the end it just gives the film more heart.The film is a lot like watching a Japanese anime (animated) more than watching an old martial arts film. It has a surreal feel to it.But it really doesn't matter what I think of it. I just say go see it. It does have subtitles, but the audience I was with did not care (and I never do anyway). There was laughter abound. It is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. The acting is SUPERB. If they dubbed it, it would have only taken away from it.Kung Fu Hussle is worth every penny. Go see it with some friends together for maximum enjoyment.",Kung Fu Hustle

190,peterinvt,Very funny at times with subtle messages,9,7 May 2005,"It not very often that I go to the same movie twice while it's in the theaters, but this one was so good I almost stayed through another showing of it on the same night. The opening dance sequence is worth the price of admission alone.The funny CGI effects are pretty cartoon like, but there's also PLENTY of action scenes to keep you going. It's almost like Roger Rabbit sometimes with the over the top effects. You're just waiting for someone to hit on the head with a frying pan and then have their head look like a frying pan.Just about every face on the screen has at least one funny moment. There's the disgruntled tenant with perpetual Plumber's butt, the bucktooth and trampy local girl, the chain-smoking landlady and silent and ineffective sidekick who can only grr timidly when asked for backup.The action doesn't let up much, but you still you want more and more.

191,bote,Refreshingly enjoyable in all respects,10,10 January 2007,"Good acting, good special effects, non-stop story.I caught this movie by chance last night on Encore channel. At first, I was rolling my eyes thinking that it would be yet another tired, overwrought martial arts story wherein some guy doesn't want to use his abilities until his love interest is captured by the bad guys, blah, blah, blah.Happily, I was surprised with a masterpiece that parodies the ridiculously impossible fight sequences so common these days, and does so without taking itself seriously. Instead of a love interest causing conflict, it is a more realistic setting of a group of people resisting gangster strong-arm tactics, something that rings true in many places.Although not a pure comedy, you will chuckle and guffaw through much of this film. I highly recommend it!",Kung Fu Hustle

Too bad he is making very less moviesand getting old. Each and every one of his movies can be watched any number of times with the same amount of fun or interest you had the first time around. Very few filmmakers achieve this. He has introduced an entirely new genre of slapstick action which was almost non existent before Stephen Chow.",Kung Fu Hustle

194,Fong_Chun_Kin,More laughs needed ^_^,8,2 January 2005,"Stephen Chow is without doubt, the greatest comedy actor alive. Having grown up with his nonsense, he's my constant source of inspiration for deadpan humour, silly slapstick and dry wit. So it comes as no surprise that I entered the cinema with mad anticipation; it has been 3 long years since I caught the scintillating Shaolin Soccer.SC has long idolized Bruce Lee, and so being the director himself, is able to fulfill his childhood dreams to pay homage to his late idol and the legend of Kung Fu. The end-product is a CGI effects laden martial arts comedy fest that leaves nothing for the imagination. Which is of course, not a necessarily good comment.The fighting scenes are top-notch, no arguments about it. A generous amount of screen time is dedicated to past Kung Fu legends who really do bring out the beauty of fist fights, wooden staff wielding and amazing footwork. Added to the effects, it is one hell of a Kung Fu film. Herein lies the problem: There is simply not enough of SC and his brand of madcap nonsense that he's so capable of producing. The limited times when he flexed his comedic muscles were the most brilliant moments of the film, and not those when he ripped off his shirt to reveal his impressive six-pac or his little-known martial arts skills. I only wish I could laugh as hard and as much as in his previous efforts. Still, SC should be respected and admired for putting himself in a backseat and let his love of Kung Fu take centrestage.However, to the non-SC fanatics, this is a lovable film that will guarantee a great time in the cinema. Credit must be given to the incredible supporting cast, like the wonderfully casted Yuen Qiu as the colourful loud-mouthed (literally) landlady, who give the film the extra edge in entertainment value. There is no better way to enjoy comedies than to experience the joy of laughing heartily together with fellow audiences in the cinema.Who should watch: Kung Fu fans and anyone who is dying for some quick laughs Who shouldn't watch: SC fanatics who'll kill themselves if this isn't as good as Shaolin Soccer Rating: 7.7",Kung Fu Hustle
195,Achoo42,"Brilliant, humorous, and wildly exciting.",10,24 May 2016,"Good: Almost everything. I love it all, from the crazy slapstick humor, to the wild kung-fu fantasy fighting, to the insane villains and incredible heroes. Stephen Chow is not a man who does things by halves. When he does things, he does it all the way. Kung Fu Hustle is physical evidence of this. Kung Fu Hustle is not a film for the meek. Everything about it is completely over the top from the beginning (where a man's leg is sliced clean in two by an axe) to the end (a kung-fu style called the Toad, which emulates the croaking and hopping of it's namesake). Another amazing aspect is the soundtrack. Inspired by classic Shaolin music, it's incredibly fitting to the scenes in this movie. I actually went out of my way to find the soundtrack to listen by itself. The special effects are a bit too much, but that's just part of it's charm and humor. This is my favorite movie of all time in terms of sheer entertainment. I've watched it 4 times already.Bad: Character development. The protagonist, Sing, isn't a hero until 3/4ths of the movie is through. And for no apparent reason or explanation other than the lollipop. The Landlady and Landlord are also cowards until the movie is halfway through, also for no apparent reason.Verdict: I highly recommend watching this movie at least once. Or twice. Or thrice. Or four times like I did.",Kung Fu Hustle
196,jgrapejiang,Not...Good Despite Positive Ratings,1,8 August 2020,"The high rating and reviews made me think this would be a good movie. 15 minutes in, my parents were disappointed by the typical Stephen Chow film, and we had to switch. I thought it was a parody of the Hong Kong fighting movies where people exhibit exaggerated expressions and float in the air/fly, but we soon realized that it IS one of those movies. Half the actors do not deliver quality acting, adding onto the disaster that the movie is already.Edit: I'm not going to justify my sense of humor, but I think it's pretty mainstream given that I laugh during Marvel movies and I like the popular comedy TV shows too. This type of movie is the kind that throws you some slapstick stuff and tries to use ""weirdness"" to underpin their ""comedy."" With a near nonexistent plot, the scenes don't drive the movie forward. I chuckled a couple of times at certain things (because I've seen them in memes a long time ago), but other than that, I was literally thinking, ""what is going on in this movie???""Comparing this to good martial arts films is aN absolute disgrace. I saw one reviewer said the fight scenes are great, especially the first one. Stylistically speaking, this movie is above the rest of those cheesy fighting films, but it is not really fighting if it's one-sided and the ""action"" ends as quickly as it started. If you've seen Daredevil, the first few seasons of Arrow, or even the Ip Man film series, then you'll actually know what decent good fighting scenes are.Edit: This is DEFINITELY a cult film, because negative reviews like mine, which would've helped me a lot in the first place, have an excessive # of downvotes, and all the reviews with high ratings have a majority of helpful votes.I hope my review sees the light of day and can prevent poor souls from watching this movie.",Kung Fu Hustle
197,almonetts,Wildly entertaining homage and satire of a great genre,9,31 May 2005,"I often marvel that stars like Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Jet Li and Chow Yun Fat are immensely talented in terms of their acting coupled with physical prowess. I now humbly add another, Stephen Chow, to that esteemed list. The movie is co-written, co-produced, directed and features Chow, who is a huge star back in China and who honestly became known to me via the quite silly, yet thoroughly entertaining Shaolin Soccer. Set in 1930s Shanghai, it is not your typical Chinese ""kung fu"" or ""kick- up"" flick. It goes beyond that, through insane sight gags and gimmicks, all of which are incredibly funny, totally ridiculous, and intensely action-driven. The movie is definitely a homage to the genre, given how well it is done, but I find it satirical, as well. Where else can you find a character who smokes like a chimney, even when she is fighting and the cigarette, never once falls out her mouth? How convenient that the skills demonstrated by some of the characters seemed learnt on the spot? It really requires that you check you r sensibilities at the door and your pulse once in a while, as it races along. The only way to further describe it is as a virtual live-action cartoon, filled with such appealing caricatures as opposed to characters, you 're bound to oblige them ninety (90) minutes of your life. There is so much to say about this movie, but I should not for fear of ruining it. The juxtaposition of the violence of the gang , the grace of the battle and yes folks, dance sequence(s) at the most inopportune moments, is plain brilliance. Chow plays a lean, wannabe member of one of the most infamous and deadly gangs in Shanghai, the Axes. He and his buddy go into Pigsty Alley pretending to be members of the Axes and find themselves in a heap of trouble, when the real Axes take offense to their foul ups and the impact on their reputation. As with all good films of this genre, there is a love story, test of courage and redemption of honor . The twist though, is that the philosophy and humor are not readily apparent, because you are visually arrested by the glorious choreographed fight sequences. The movie does not let this on that easily though, as it is only when it wraps up, you realize how much more was going on. This is one flick which is destined for cult status!!",Kung Fu Hustle
198,moniker_jones,"""Hustle"" Flows",8,6 November 2005,"He may not be Orson Welles, but Asian wunderkind Stephen Chow isn't about to let that slow him down. He wrote, produced, directed, and even opted to star in Kung Fu Hustle. The film, which pays homage to the very genre it spoofs, delivers this typically stagnant spring movie season a desperately needed kick to the funny bone. While Chow received minor acclaim with his last directorial effort, Shaolin Soccer, it is Hustle that will likely make moviegoers around the world stand up and take notice of his myriad talents. Chow plays Sing, a wayward young adult trying his hand at mischief. He longs to become a member of the widely feared Axe Gang. A routine grift in Pig Sty Alley leads to a huge brawl between the Axe Gang and a band of local kung fu masters. Pandemonium ensues.The script, while inventive, is hardly the driving force of this wickedly maniacal picture. Chow has created what could best be described as a living cartoon. The theatrical scenery, musical numbers, and outlandish camera-work somehow fuse together perfectly, leaving the audience both startled and riddled with laughter. The fight scenes are a bit lengthy, especially during the last act of the film, but that's to be expected. And while the jokes don't always hit home, the ones that do are truly hilarious. Kung Fu Hustle, while technically a foreign film, will likely speak to most audience members through its universal languages of humor, innocence, and unbridled zaniness.Rating: B+",Kung Fu Hustle
199,TwentyCalls,You must know Stephen Chow to see how amazing this movie is,10,25 April 2007,"I must admit I'm a fan of Stephen Chow. Liked many (but not all) of his shows. I can almost say that I grew up watching his movies. At one stage of his acting career, I thought his shows were going downhill. Then came Shaolin Soccer - I thought that was the best. Now, the bar was up with Kung Fu Hustle. There was still a good amount of slapstick comedy in the show that was his trademark. Other than that, the Kung Fu was FANTASTIC! The story - very well done. Right amount of romance to gel the hard core action. So retro and so enjoyable to watch. One has to sit back and just take in the silliness and at the same time, be amazed by the fighting scenes.",Kung Fu Hustle
200,superadde69,Outstanding movie :),10,27 April 2005,"The story about a village in China, a group of black men and a man named Sing. To start, Kung-Fu Hustle begins with some gruesome action which makes you chocked. Although it is a comedy it has blood in it. But Honestly :), this movie is completely outstanding. If there's one as fantastic as this one it's got to be ""Shaolin Soccer"". While this movie blows your mind totally, it is the cause of Stephen Chow's inspiring directing and variate acting. Every scene in this movie are well-performed, laughable (but in a good way of course) :), and totally astonishing. It's awesome that you automatically feel you're sucked in to the blending story with Kung-Fu action, comedy and almost crying cut-scenes. In other words, a good mix of imaginative and wicked fights are round the corner all the time an' there's always sumthin' to look forward to :),A definite 10/10 score-rating by me. Enjoy the *MaStErPiEcE*",Kung Fu Hustle
201,deadclowncollege,"Plenty of kung-fu, but it's no hustle: Just a very good film",8,24 April 2005,"Perhaps the best thing about Kung Fu Hustle is how self-aware it is. The Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions may have had some very cool chop-socky fights, but the directors took it all so seriously it took a lot of the fun out of it for me. Kung Fu Hustle realizes how inherently silly it is and doesn't try to hide it. It revels in it.In the film's hierarchy of gangs, the Axe Gang reign supreme. In the film's opening the leader beats a man to death and shoots a woman in the back with a shotgun. This is followed by axe dancing. The only people spared their choreographed doom are those who live in deep poverty. So Sing (Stephen Chow) and his partner decide to masquerade as Axe Gang members and extort some money from such a place. They are surprised to find out that three kung fu gurus live amongst the district's tenants.It's a good rule of thumb that if you're going to spend a bunch of money on CGI that you might as well have fun with it. Kung Fu Hustle takes this to heart. One guy uses steel rings on his hand along with two other guys to beat up a legion of Axe Gang members. In another scene, Sing is chased by the landlady (Qui Yuen) with those little speed blurs that always followed the Roadrunner. And most memorably, the landlady catches her husband (Wah Yuen) with lipstick on his cheek and throws him out of a building. He falls down hitting a number of things on the way and when he hits ground a flowerpot falls on his head.I'm going to take this minute to praise Stephen Chow because he stars in the film he directed yet avoids the pitfall of self-indulgence. Instead of making his character unbelievably witty and with an unattainable love interest (something Woody Allen can't seem to stop doing), he plays a pathetic and intensely despicable character up until about the last fifteen minutes. Actually, scratch that. He does have a love interest but she has so little screen time she's barely worth mentioning.The oddest character though has to be the Beast (Siu Lung Leung). About halfway in the movie Sing is accepted as a member of the Axe Gang. The Axe Gang leader needs someone to get the Beast and Sing is the only person desperate enough to do it. You see, the Beast was so obsessed with kung fu he went crazy. And it's up to Sing to free him. I'm not going spoil the moment, but let's just say that he's hardly the image of terror and bloodlust Sing expected.Kung Fu Hustle has such an infectious tone that it helps to cancel out some of its flaws. For example, just about everyone's personality changes immensely in the final few moments. And I'm even willing to forget the handful of gross-out humor moments. Because Kung Fu Hustle is a joyful film, and it's rare I ever see that these days.",Kung Fu Hustle

It's a great send-up of, and homage to, all those ""Chop Socky"" films that have come from Asia and elsewhere. This was well produced, funny, and well paced. The computer generated special effects were well enough done and just added to the over-the-top comedic nature of the whole affair. This movie does _not_ take itself seriously and that's a welcome change after the overly pretentious films like ""Hero"" and ""House of Flying Daggers.""

203,BraveHawk,Visually Stunning & Just Plain Funny!,9,24 April 2005,"Kung Fu Hustle was one of the most visually imaginative and unique movies I have seen in quite some time. Upon first viewing the trailer, I thought we would have another Kung Pow: Enter The Fist on our hands but, boy, was I wrong. Unlike Kung Pow, the jokes did not grow tired on me and the special effects were definitely top notch. The scene with the two assassins playing that stringed instrument (don't know the name of it) in such a way that it kills was incredible.Although there was not much to the story, it was not non-existent, either. There was a simple story happening which made sense for what we were watching. Even the jokes with the subtitles came across as funny, and from my experience, humor does not translate as easily as this movie would have you believe. It borrowed or spoofed a bit from Spider-Man and The Matrix as well, which was a bit unexpected for this film, initially. At least for me.To be honest, I could enjoy this movie without sound or subtitles, too. It was that appealing to the eye. It would be a good background movie for a party or poker game which could catch your eye at any moment and still hold your attention. It could also be great if you feel like a good comedy. I was entertained throughout and even though I was dead tired when I saw it in the theater, it held my interest all the way to the end. 9/10",Kung Fu Hustle
204,da_hal,"Very disappointing follow-up to ""Shaolin Soccer.""",5,3 April 2005,"The basic problem with the entire film is that it tries to outdo ""shaolin soccer."" in this, it fails. the reason it fails is one simple reason: originality. most American films fail miserably because they try to copy a successful formula from before. what you end up with is a copy, and an inferior one at that. some scenes i felt were copied from: 1. gangs of new york 2. warner brothers cartoons, most notably road runner 3. the mask 4. ""it happened one night"" 5. the matrix reloaded and the matrix 6. spiderman probably more, but i didn't watch the originals. i am fairly certain some of the jokes came out of charlie chaplin, harold lloyd, and the three stooges. The affect this had on me was deep disappointment and disgust. the funniest parts in ""shaolin soccer"" were original and (I felt) actually outtakes that made it into the final film. they took chances with original situations and, even though not 100% successful, were interesting nonetheless in their daring. This feeling was made even stronger because of the great fight sequences. this is one of those movies, to me, where i will probably memorize the time counter for the fight scenes and ignore everything else. there are 4 fight sequences: the first is fairly traditional, the 2nd is more CGI yet effective, the third is a good balance between cgi and action, but the fourth is almost total cgi which features one of the most powerful (in kung fu film history) fighting styles in the most boring way, i.e. the mighty toad style. If they had added a few minutes to the film, they could have had a much better product simply by making more characters three dimensional rather than flat. In the small village, many great fighters chose to live in anonimity, trying to retire from kung fu. Why? Out of the 5 ""great"" masters in the village, only 2 refer to a specific event in the past (although no details surrounding the event) and another can be guessed at. otherwise, there is no information at all about why each person chose to live in hiding. But, going back to the fight sequences: I hate fighting styles where the move is very dumb yet supposedly powerful. This movie features many of these, including: The Lion's Roar, Buddha Palm from Heaven, the Amplified Lion's Roar, Toad Head Butt, etc. etc. etc., although I will say this is marginally better than having them announce the move before attacking as in old run run shaw films, this film became a crappy cgi fest. However, several of the fight scenes were very well done. I really enjoy the many-vs-few fight when the few enter the fight one-by-one after making a moral decision, e.g. the first fighter is almost swarmed, and the next guy jumps in just in time, etc. etc. Other than the fights and the unoriginality, the underlying story was pretty good. basically, it's about a guy who wanted to be a hero, but in his first time out, gets beaten badly and is convinced that being bad is the only way to win, but a girl makes him see the truth. Plus, he's a miserable failure as a bad guy. I think, overall, that this film was sabotaged by the incredible 'shaolin soccer.' Shaolin soccer set the bar too high on CGI-support in fight scenes, and original comedy. hopefully, stephen chow will realize that the best way to make good comedy is character and situation, not formulae.",Kung Fu Hustle

210,londonscot2003,Kung phooey,3,13 January 2014,"This film is a semi homage, and half mockery, of all kung fu movies and as such, I found it didn't mix well. Are you supposed to laugh? It's not that funny, and the few laughs that are genuine are usually undercut by some extreme violence that jars with the humour.Are you supposed to enjoy the kung fu fights? They weren't that spectacular. Most of the fights were inforced with elements of special effects, which takes away from the fact that this is kung fu. It's hard to think that a fight is amazing when it's so obviously CGI.So you're not exactly wowed by amazing fight scenes, most of which were pretty repetitive anyway, with some poor choreography that made most of the fights look slightly messy.Of course, Hustle is meant to be cartoony, which is fine, and the special effects are pretty amazing, but the film never struck the correct balance between action and comedy.The storyline is basic fodder. Two chancer want to join the axe gang, who want to get revenge on a peasant village. Usual revenge story ensues with an underdog hero. The film trudges along without the use of a plot in most cases, just fight after fight, and gets repetitive.Of course, Stephen Chow is pretty good. But he's better as a serious actor. Come on, Chow, you've got better stuff in you!The extras are pretty worthwhile. a made for TV making of is decent, and an interview with Chow quite informative and funny.

He's made an entertaining and violently amusing Bruce Lee-inspired Kung Fu flick!Thankfully spared from dubbed motion picture Hell, this received the proper subbing job and it really doesn't affect the story or humor in any way, the sight gags are fairly good and the conversations are quite comical.But this film's shinning quality is the violence, it's quite gory it times but never disturbing, not matter how absurd the death is, it's always funny.Plus, Brother Sum has to be the greatest character in motion picture history!Bruce Lee fans will especially recognize references to his films, and if you thought Kill Bill was a marvelous gore-comedy, you'll dig this, 10 Blargs out of 10,",Kung Fu Hustle

215,aoc777,Chinese cinema is evolving,10,20 July 2005,"The last few years have seen many excellent Chinese movies ranging from historical dramas, as in The Emperor and the Assassin, to brilliant action movies, Hero, House of Flying Daggers, comedies like Shaolin Soccer, thrillers like infernal affairs and more.Kung Fu Hustle is the next step of what I consider the growing up of the Chinese Film Industry. Gong Fu is an action film full of some of the finest martial arts you can find. But it does not stop there. Latest cgi and cinematic effects are deployed with ease to make the experience truly magnificent. This part could describe a well made but typical Hollywood action production. But Gong Fu grows beyond that, incorporating very satirical elements that make this movie a treat. If you are a fan of Kung Fu movies or if you are a critic, this film can entice both as it presents a delectable parody of the genre without taking itself too seriously. In so far it accomplishes what Hollywood has lost somewhere along the way, the ability to make a funny and inventive movie that is filled with little thoughtful vignettes to discover while still appealing to a broad public.There are scenes, which are so overdrawn that they become surreal, moments when you can not believe what is happening on screen. Typical clichés like bad synchronization so common in past Chinese movies are delightfully played upon. In parts of the movie I was even reminded of scenes from Dragonball Z and other anime. But underneath it all Gong Fu does not hide its social critique and puts the finger on several points that might hurt if you think about them.Overall this is a movie for nearly everyone, providing gags and entertainment, if you just want to relax, and little hints and thoughts to contemplate, if you are of the thoughtful persuasion. In my opinion it is one of this years top movies. Recommended!!!",Kung Fu Hustle
216,mehmetoney,Fantastic,9,10 July 2005,"I can say this was one of the best movies I have ever seen. The most amazing thing of this movie is, originality.. A great sense of humor, wonderful kungfu scenes, comedy, romance and hilarious fun. It is something like (killbill)+(spiderman)+(adamsandler)....It is not a well known way of storytelling, which gives you an unexpected way of having fun from a movie. In these days that Hollywood cinema is suffering from lack of original ideas, these kind of independent movies will continue to nail us in our seats..All apart, Stephen Chow is brilliant with his acting, directing and writing.. He will fascinate us with more movies I think..A definite 10 out of 10.",Kung Fu Hustle

218,coolsharpharp,If you like to laugh you will like this film,8,21 February 2006,I was thoroughly blown away with how much I enjoyed this movie. It has a full range of comic moments ranging from the wry smile to the full out belly laugh. The laughs are a mixture of witty dialogue and the visualisation of farcical moments.The plot centres on various martial arts masters protecting a village from a bunch of gangsters. Embroiled in this battle is Sing (Stephen Chow) who at first instigates the violence but eventually comes to the aid of the villagers.Inbetween the stunning fight scenes and the great humour there are some moments of genuine pathos. Sing's story with the deaf girl is particularly touching as is the moment when he tells his clumsy sidekick to stay away from him.This film has reawakened my interest in East Asian cinema and I intend to pursue it. I would recommend this film to anybody who likes to laugh out loud.,Kung Fu Hustle
219,pogo747,a great slapstick/action movie you don't have to be Chinese to enjoy,8,1 February 2005,"Wow! this movie really made my day! It's very rare that I can say that about a movie, but today, I left the theater with a smile on my face thinking ""that was money well spent."" (Movies are normally $18-20 USD here in Japan, but the first of the month is 1/2 price, making that NORMAL price for me as a former New Yorker). This movie is really something special and I whole-heartedly recommend it to anyone who likes kung-fu, slapstick, action, and everything in between. It's got characters you can love, unrelenting action sequences, an appropriate amount of weirdness, great CGI, heart-warming moments... even a tiny romance element. The fight choreography is done by none other than the masters Yuen Wo Ping and Sammo Hung (together!). It's a fun, light-hearted action-comedy that's got something for everyone. If you've seen Shaolin Soccer (or earlier films like God of Cookery), you may have scratched your head at the bizarre references in Chow's movies. If you're not Chinese or don't understand Cantonese, you probably won't get many of the jokes, no matter how hard the translators try. You won't find that in KFH. The story here has been much more sanitized for a larger non-Chinese audience. Chow eschewed a lot of the quirkiness and culturally-specific jokes in favor of a movie that is more accessible to a wider audience, using more universal themes, visual gags, and a whole lotta arse-beatings. Shaolin Soccer really blew the doors off HK action-comedy cinema when it came out, but I don't think Chow had any idea it would become so big outside of HK. It had a cult following in Japan and the US and was big here for a little while but many people just didn't get it due to the many cultural jokes. None of that in KFH. Chow just concentrated on giving everyone a good time. The 40'ish Japanese man sitting next to me in the theatre laughed as much as I did throughout the movie (and i grew up speaking Cantonese!) of course, it's stupid. it's unbelievable, it's a little weird, but it's fun, got great action, great CG.. even a few sad moments. I loved the heroes, especially, the old couple. Go watch it for yourself! If you hate it, then someone's gotta check to make sure you still have a sense of humor.",Kung Fu Hustle
220,pauldelery,Someone is still creative!,10,4 May 2005,"With most Hollywood garbage these days being so formulaic and cliché we can all be thankful for those making movies outside of LA. Kung Fu Hustle combines humor, creativity, imagination (WAY out the box when compared to most US movies) epic fight scenes and wonderful cinematography. The references it makes are side-splitting and the Bugs Bunny and Shining examples stand out as two that are remarkably timed. I think if you go see this movie and check all your expectations and disbelief at the door you will have the fantastic movie experience of being whisked away to another world... the reason we see movies in the first place, right?",Kung Fu Hustle
221,talbaineric,"A tiny bit disappointing, but not much",7,11 September 2005,"I just added Kung Fu Hustle to my DVD collection. It's a very worthy title indeed. The film tells the story of a wannabe thug who wants to join the Axe Gang, one of the more notorious of China's violent street gangs. From there, the film opens into a melee of fantastic visuals and quirky charms that can compete with the more lackluster Hollywood scene these days (when it comes to most comedies I mean).Everything was executed great. However, I found myself disappointed with what I felt was the lack of comedy that looked promising from the trailers. I expected the whole movie to be filled with these funny scenes, but the whole movie wasn't dedicated to comedy, which threw me off. However, that doesn't stop it from being a creative genius in it's own right. A good movie to own indeed.",Kung Fu Hustle

It is mildly funny, seemingly based mostly on material from other movies. It tries to combine comedy, action, tragedy and most other genres. I'm not against such combinations in general, but there must be at least something good that comes out of it. In this case the result is below average in all fields. It is not a good Kung-Fu movie, it is not a good comedy, it is not a good action, it is not a good Chinese movie. It is also very predictable on the basic level. If you didn't laugh once in the first 10 minutes of the movie, you will probably not laugh during the rest of the movie.",Kung Fu Hustle
224,TinPigeon,Unexpected,9,13 August 2005,"Wow. I was quite surprised by this flick. I was expecting something akin to ""Kung Pow: Enter the Fist"" or ""Top Secret."" The trailer looked a little silly, and I never paid it much attention. It came home on video though, and after watching it we all agreed that we were pleasant surprised. The story unfolded much like some other Asian films, like ""Hero"" and ""House of Flying Daggers."" There was emotional struggle of lost love, and underdog vs. overwhelming force. The special effects were a bit over the top, but I feel they really did fit in well with the overall concept of the plot. Even through all the sadness and anxiety the plot provided, it all did finish up with a solid ending.",Kung Fu Hustle

226,MrChi,Let's Chow on some cerebral cornflakes,8,30 November 2005,"Stephen Chow has problems. He's one of Asia's biggest stars but he has subject matters that seem too flimsy for his versatile personality. So what's the solution? Make them edgy, or garnish his ideas with deep and troubled characters, which can sometimes be negative. What he does, is add zang and plenty of people getting seven shades of Asia beaten out of them in his latest offering - Kung Fu Hustle.The man who brought you Shaolin Soccer, the kung fu versus premiership rumble, is back with a film that blends immiscible themes akin to an oil/water/fire combo. But there is talent here, something reminiscent of the Coen brothers in their complexity and setting up camp in leftfield.The multi-talented Chow directs and he does that well. He writes and he does that well. As the lead, Sing, he does that very well as he morphs into a comedian that can and will split your sides (and I'm not just talking about laughter) Set in pre-revolution China, Kung Fu Hustle is a brutal take on gang warfare within a seemingly peaceful community. Despite Matrix-esquire choreography and special effects, the film remains serene in a child-like way. Chow clearly had fun writing and performing in what is essentially a comedy.We witness a turf war erupt between the Axe Gang and the residents of Pig Sty Alley, neither of which are clever names, as the Axe Gang begin by chopping and scalping and the residents rise from their squalor and use their combat aptitudes to complete the David and Goliath analogy. Sing and his overweight bumbling sidekick are caught in the middle as he pretends to be a member of the Axe Gang and helps the feud escalate.In all Kung Fu Hustle succeeds because it does what it says on the tin. It is a well envisaged roller coaster of a movie that has naïve comedic value and almost lends the film innocence. This is blended surprisingly well without glitches as comedy turns to brutal violence in some amazing set pieces that see people hacked, kicked, slapped and musically destroyed in one of the closing scenes (you'll see what I mean).The characters are well thought out and lend their own comedy and fighting skills to the setup. Note the chain smoking landlady and the song and dance routines that on the surface seem ludicrous but add bonus comedy value as you know someone is about to have their teeth cut out or met with the 'Hand of God'- a brilliant scene that ends the film.Another worthy attempt by Mr Chow, creating 95 minutes of well thought (and fought) out, thoughtless action! Phew",Kung Fu Hustle
227,leggygal_7,Wham Bam thank you Stephen Chow!,8,24 August 2005,"I have to confess to being a little perplexed and intrigued by the trailer for this film and was certain that it had to be checked out. What an original and amazing film it was. Rejuvenating the Kung-Fu genre in its totally out there form. Funning, startling and at times plain cute, this really was an adventure at the cinema. Go see if for yourself! Chow uses special effects in a masterly fashion, like a painter with a vast and varied palette. The cast are spectacular and their puny looking bodies make the stunts that much more exciting. The land-lady's facial expressions are the stuff of acting genius.

Not parody funny, it never made fun of itself, like say, a Kung Pow, but it manages to make you laugh on several occasions throughout the film. The story is rather captivating apposed to most other action- kung fu movies. The story is this, a man who wants to join the Axe Gang because he learns good guys always lose, well, joins the axe gang, only to find that good always wins. There are some funny characters, like an assassin who dresses like a woman because of years in jail, and a lady who screams to attack (Sindel anyone?)

231,quixotegrrl,Buddhism my a**,7,31 May 2005,"All right - Stephen Chow is extremely clever, and I understand and appreciate what he was trying to do. This was one of the most creatively derivative films I've seen in a very long time. And once you get into the Looney Tunes frame of mind, the slapstick humor does work.The biggest problem for me was that the first six or so minutes of the film were not only unnecessary but incongruous with this frame of mind, and made it nearly impossible for me to make the ""switch"" for the next twenty minutes. Since there was a written preface on screen about the gang wars before the viewer was transported to Pig Sty, why were the unfunny and brutal opening scenes needed? I found myself wondering if the beginning was the LAST thing added, on the advice of an executive (""Steve-o, you should do a 'Gangs of New York' sendup!""). I'm no Tarantino fan, I cover my eyes during Scorsese films, and seeing an unarmed woman shot in the back (body and blood flying) isn't exactly my idea of a good time. It made it kind of hard for me to get into Jackie Chan mode. I may be ""sensitive,"" but I don't think that's such a bad thing.I also had to comment on the dumbed-down infusion of Buddhism in the film...it's disappointing to see such a simplistic, Western, John Wayne representation of a religion I admire, but in a story like this where you have to have good guys and bad guys (and the bad guys must be destroyed) I guess you have to have a cosmology closer to the more fundamentalist of the Bible-based religions. Chow's lost-boy character was the only indication that ""good"" and ""bad"" are more complicated than that.",Kung Fu Hustle

While I still had the impression from those clods that this movie was'nt so great, I did notice that everyone who did see this movie were raving about it. I finally got to catch it on the small screen and it rocked. At times, the movie can strangely go over the top and cartoony and then settle back right down into seriousness.

It is too busy with paying homages to find a face of its own. The comedy, story, and characters don't feel fresh and come off as rather artificial and forced. Moreover the usage of CG feels really excessive. Looks like Stephen Chow has succumbed to the Hollywood trend of using CG for its own sake, even if it doesn't really serve the movie. Anyway, I'm sure most people will like it, since it's right in line with Hollywood blockbuster flashiness while maintaining a bit of Chinese wackiness, but I for one felt very disappointed.",Kung Fu Hustle

I doubt the whole kung-fu genre requires realism to work so please stop nit-picking about this factor.Kung Fu Hustle is a fresh and original film which re-vitalises both the comedy and action genre. Their is an almost perfect balance between the two genres, at one side of the spectrum you have witty tongue in cheek and slapstick but on the other side their are well constructed fight scenes which breathe new life into kung fu movies.As goofy as the visuals appear in the film, the plot is well constructed and focuses through a variety of character development, all characters are full of life, from the dominant land lady to the oppressive gang leader.In conclusion this film has a perfect balance between comedy and action as none of the separate genres destroy the other ones mood. Some of the fight scenes may be considered a little too goofy for some viewers but apart from this kung fu hustle is a good film. Yes it is silly and unrealistic but this is used to almost satire other kung fu films.The Comedy and Action unify as well as the ying yang in this funny thriller.",Kung Fu Hustle

""Gong Fu,"" or ""Kung Fu Hustle,"" combines every classic element of the genre and takes it farther than humanly imaginable. With mindblowing CG effects, wire work, fight choreography, acting, editing, score and (ultimately) directing, the film is able to be absolutely hysterical yet certifiably epic and moving. If you don't believe me, just look at the whoppingly disproportionate amount of 10s this flick received from obviously hardcore kung-fu mavens who've seen it already. Personally, I thought Matrix One set a new precedent for the action movie, and was vastly disappointed with the sequels. ""Gong Fu"" properly fulfills the destiny of action-movie evolution, as well as make you wet your pants with laughter.",Kung Fu Hustle

While the plot is fairly predictable and the acting extends to silly/goofy at times, the film is thoroughly enjoyable.I would have left out the subplot with the woman and the lollipop, as it brings too much into the film without rounding out this emotional bit, but it somehow still works. Additionally, the chubby sidekick is overdone as well.I would have like to have seen more traditional kung fu, but it was overwhelmed by all the special efforts.My personal favorites are the set and costume design.

The only reason I gave it 2 and not 1 star is relatively good camera work. Stay away.Comparison with Jackie Chun, Buster Keaton or Quentin Tarantino give this movie way too much credit.

The story is simple and boy does he know how to tell a good old story. A good nobody turned bad and finally redeemed himself at the end - a very common theme that's almost always in Chow's movies. Some super duper wuxia heroes retired in some remote settings tried to live a normal life only being forced to fight one more final battle - a very common theme in wuxia novels. The movie makes some very good references to old Cantonese wuxia movies as well as works by Jing Yong, the Godfather of wuxia novels. All the Gong Fu or Kung Fu fight scenes are outrageous, and they are outrageously funny and good. I am glad I find them enjoyable. In my mind, Gong Fu Hustle and Crouching Tiger Hidden Tiger are probably the only 2 movies that do justices to the wuxia genre.",Kung Fu Hustle

And I'm just not talking about his use of CGI effects, which allow for both amazing martial arts sequences, but cartoony gags worth of Frank Tashlin and Chuck Jones. While Chow's comedy can be quite broad, he is exceptionally clever -- there's a gag involving a cat walking on a roof behind a kung fu master that is Simpsons-worthy. Much like the Ax Gang dance sequence (which is teased in the trailer), it's an example of the constant flow of ideas (hmmm...something else that is a hallmark of The Simpsons). Chow and his collaborators never stop coming up with new things, making the movie a constant delight.It would be a shame if the Kung Fu in the title would dissuade potential viewers from seeing one of the best comedies of the past 10 years.",Kung Fu Hustle

He says this is just a brilliant movie, over the top, yes, but in a GREAT way. Oh, those unforgettable characters, like the landlady, the martial artists living ordinary lives, the poverty stricken Hong Kong that we remember....incidentally, this movie puts other ones to shame, because although there are lots and lots of CGI, the martial artists are real masters who need no CGI at all, not flimsy actors who rely solely on CGI to do anything.

In fact I would say that this film really is more of an action film than comedy. The funny parts were too far and few between and the over the top action was the centerpiece.On top of that the story lacks cohesiveness.

Other kung fu movies have longer action sequences, but it doesn't matter, the action sequences are so fun that it makes up for the shortness of the fights. I will say though, the special effects in this movie almost crossed the line for being mistaken for a cartoon...but I'm not complaining. The acting in the movie is also good...the best actors in the movie have to be the beast, the landlady, and Stephen Chow's character.

The story never stops moving, and it's never predictable! It's so much fun!
I wasn't sure about whether I'd enjoy it so I threw it on when I was bored and cleaning. Within the first minute I was officially glued to my couch for the entire movie.
You can tell that this movie was a labor of love.
Stephen Chow absolutely made a one in a million movie, and I recommend highly that you watch it!",Kung Fu Hustle
252,rhkoehler,Such a good movie!!!!,10,23 May 2017,"Kung Fu Hustle is a movie about Kung Fu masters facing one another, protecting one another, and battling the Axe Gang. I have never heard of this movie and I was told to watch it for my final for my Perspectives class and I truly did not have high hopes for this movie, but I was wrong! This movie was absolutely great and I enjoyed watching it so much. It was such a good mix of feelings for the viewer as well. You felt sad at some points, you felt happy in others, and the rest of it was just plain exciting. I can not tell you how much I laughed during this movie and I was watching it with my mother as well, she thought it was weird but she laughed multiple times. The movie also has an interesting mixture of time periods and mixing of different cultures. It was sort of like a western film, mixed with roaring 20's, mixed with old school gangs and mafias like in ""The Godfather"", mixed with a goofy Stephen Chow movie. I thought the story line was goofy, yet exciting and I would totally recommend this to anyone who wants to watch a goofy Chinese Kung Fu movie. I honestly wish there was a remake of this movie!",Kung Fu Hustle
253,monkeykingkill,Didn't like it the first time I watched,9,14 October 2020,"I've never been a fan of Stephen Chow and have always thought he's just OK but overrated.I also didn't like this movie the first time I watched it, finding it silly, just like his other works. His comedy to me seemed always forced and unnatural. I had the same opinion on this film too.Nonetheless, after a few years I had watched it again and I changed my mind, believing it is a real good one, because it is actually not as shallow as it appears to be (exaggerating and silly), but you find a deeper meaning behind each scene.Today I watched it again, I have to say it is a master piece in its own kind.
The title ""Kung Fu"" actually goes so well too, since ""kungfu"" itself in most movies are portrayed almost always as good as super power.",Kung Fu Hustle
254,cabrita,Stephen Chow has become in the new genius of China's comedy!!!!!!!!!,7,12 May 2005,"I just loved this movie; it has a simple but well driven story. Stephen Chow talent is imminent not only because he has written, directed and acted in this motion picture but also because he, like me, is a lover of kung Fu movies.Asia has produced some amazing movies in the last years, some of them I considered masterpieces, (like OldBoy, Hero or Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) and others are as entertaining and thrilling as a roller- coaster (like ONG-BAK) and now, Kung-Fu Hustle, which is going to make you smile forever, I couldn't stop laughing while I was watching it.Stephen chow's character (Sing) is desperate to be accepted by the most evil gang that ruled Shanghai in the 40's, the notorious ""Axe Gang"" which is formed by guys dressed in black suits. Although he wants to be a bad man, and doing bad things, everything goes wrong every time he try it, mostly because he doesn't know how to fight or how to make a mayhem action, because deep inside him he is pure. So in his search for becoming an evil man he gets into a small housing little village where lives humble people, and he tried to blackmail a young hairdresser and here is where the good action begins. The first turn in the movie comes when three great Kung Fu masters, who had lived, uncovered among the humble people shows his power to defend the people in the village. Then the Axe Gang leader hired two great Kung-Fu assassins to take revenge on the people of the village.This movie has many hilarious moments; one of my favorites is when the landlord (after he and the landlady shows their real power in the second big turn of the movie) is talking with one of the almost dead fighter after defeat the two assassins and he speak in English stealing the Sean Connery's line at end The Untouchables of Brian De Palma, when Malone tells to Eliot Ness: ""WHAT ARE YOU PREPARED TO DO!"" and then the landlord tell him ""why are you talking in English"".The fights are awesome, very well choreographed, of course by the master 'Yuen Woo-Ping', best known for his collaboration in the Matrix saga.The subplot story of Sing and his love interest is simply wonderful, though they never talk each other the looks and the flashback are enough to create a beautiful love story. Just like a Chaplin movie. As I said before, I just loved this movie. You should see it!",Kung Fu Hustle

I don't know, maybe i was spoilt as a kid by having the benefit of the three dragons making movies to a niche market in an era when word of mouth and not social media drove cinematic entertainment. I had to turn this off after 20 minutes. It doesn't compare with anything from the 70's up to todays films like IP man. The humour's(if you can call it that with a serious face) derived from racist stereotypes If you love Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, the three dragons or any half decent Chinese kung fu movies going back to late 70's give this a miss. Even the 'out there' Chinese vampire movies are better than this nonsense. Its poor. I'm putting Operation condor or project a on, i need therapy after subjecting myself to that :(",Kung Fu Hustle
257,davidkcwong,3 years of expectation and this is.....,9,24 January 2005,"As a HUGE fan of Stephen Chow, (and i mean huge as in; watched each of his movies at least 50-100 times) this movie was suppose to be like water in the desert for the thirst of his fans.However, and unfortunately, after 3 years of waiting since ""Shaolin Soccer"", I must say that this movie clearly shows Stephen has lost the 'touch' he had with ""Shaolin Soccer"". It's not quite possible for Stephen's fans NOT to compare this movie with his last one, especially after such a long period of waiting, and the similar special effects that was used in both movies. And in comparison, this movie seems to follow the tracks of ""Shaolin Soccer"" too much, which doesn't give the same excitement, surprises and laughters.The plot of the movie itself leaves many question marks for audiences. Not only a lot of the parts of the movie doesn't make any sense at all, a lot of the scenes were also quite meaningless and useless, which could be placed with better scenes to complete the story a lot better.The Music, Actors, Sets and the whole movie production itself was quite fabulous and has definitely gone much more international than his precious movies. If you're also a fan of Stephen Chow, you can probably tell that this movie has some resemblance of his movies ""A Chinese Odyssey"", where Stephen tried to reduce the humor and added more importance towards the music and production as a whole. If the movie could reduce the comical effects and emphasize more on the plot like he did in ""Flirting Scholar"" or ""King of Beggars"", this would be a perfect movie for his first official Hollywood movie.",Kung Fu Hustle

They have successfully surpassed Shaolin Soccer with flying colors. Stephen Chow is a very unique individual to come up with a concept like this for the traditional Kung Fu style cinema. When I seen this movie I really didn't know what to expect. Just when you think that you would figure the movie out it would just turn another direction and amaze you. The fact that the action sequences were amazing yet funny was what was so attention grasping. I can't remember a time during the movie where I didn't laugh. It's not easy to integrate humor with fighting sequences, but they pull it off perfectly. My hat is off to this movie and it's creators. My 5 bucks were well spent because I got more than what I bargained for.",Kung Fu Hustle

Thank goodness I'd been to the toilet before I started watching this movie... Highly recommended as it is on of the best/funniest movies I have ever seen. Hollywood can really learn from Stephen. Instead of doing re-makes of classics they should something original. This movie ticks every box for me as it so refreshing. Usually have to watch big blockbusters of Hollywood that either have too much smooching or too much limbs flying about with siblings. This is the first movie that I enjoyed with them in a very long time without 1 squabble. I know it's a miracle ;) Thanks for saving a Saturday night Stephen! Owe you!,Kung Fu Hustle

Wonderful acting and directing has elevated this film to a level, on par with with other unique and innovative films like Crouching Tiger or The Matrix.At one time I hated all kung fu movies (like most, I could only tolerate Bruce Lee and couldn't understand goofy HK kung fu cinema.)

To even compare it to those two does not do it justice, the people who made this film were awake! Because of the action and good sound this is best seen on the big screen, but if you can't see it on the big screen, just make sure you see it :-) Good music, good humour, big characters, good choreography, plenty of surprises and a story set at a fun pace.The people who made this used many of their own ideas, not something you see that often these days in mainstream cinema and that is why I found this so refreshing.

265,sdfrsdfr,Silly but fun! (***1/2),7,4 January 2005,"There is a dish in South East Asian countries called the 'rojak'; a mix of sliced greens, fried fritters, squid and eggs and topped with a thick peanut gravy. It doesn't sound particularly promising, looks much worse but locals justifiably pick their plates clean every time. This much can be said of Stephen Chow's erstwhile effort, the dodgy cornball humour of ""Shaolin Soccer"", and now, the chowster is back for another dose of shenanigans with ""Kung Fu Hustle"", already a huge hit in this region. Just like the 'rojak', Hong Kong cinema and movies like KungFu Hustle would never be mistaken for high art, with subtlety thrown further out the window than the protagonists are during the action sequences, and slapstick jarringly pitched at hysterical levels wedged in between dramatic sequences. There is a feeble plot about finding one's true self and being the ""chosen one"" as the denizens of a local town must fight against the powerful Axes gangsters, but one can't seriously discuss narrative possibilities when the lead in the film uses such gifts as the ""hurricane power palm blow"" (it's a kung fu move diametrically opposed to David Carradines ""exploding palm"" technique in Kill Bill; one strike and a 50 foot palm print appears on the side of buildings. You get the drift).Stephen Chow is already a veteran in his native Hong Kong, where he first started out in collaboration with or in imitation of that other master of lowbrow humour, Wong Jing. One dimensional caricatures feature prominently in these movies, and Chow puts on the same deadpan expression and parochial cantonese drone in literally dozens of (best-selling) films. It is nice to see him maturing somewhat, just like Tom Hanks did; currently, Chow is already a reliable male lead in dramatic roles, not that his role in KungFu hustle would stretch any reasonably seasoned thespian.It is interesting to note the role slapstick in Hong Kong films; it is similar to the recitativo in Italian opera, and the singing sequences in Bollywood films. They are interludes in the narrative designed to play to the audiences, which says a lot about audience tastes. Western viewers not familiar with Hong Kong cinema have generally been perplexed, but those of us in the know take it with a groan and quickly wait for the next kung fu sequence. There are, however, several laugh out loud slapstick sequences in Kung Fu Hustle that comes as a nice surprise (the surprise being that it was actually funny, and reasonably inoffensive).The action choreography is first rate, the special effects are hugely imaginative, all in all the technical credits are above par for a Hong Kong film.The references to the Matrix are courtesy of great wire-kung fu fights choreographed by the inestimable Yuen Wo Ping. But it is the less obvious references to Terry Gilliam's ""the adventures of Baron Munchausen"" that truly bring a chuckle. One of the characters is as fleet of feet as Berthold, while the ending is a nice touch: a small boy leads a girl by hand towards a movie theatre, and on the streets, a peddler sells a series of kung fu adventure comics to another urchin. As most young Asian boys will know, a kung fu comic promises fantastical adventures on the cheap, very much in the spirit of this often low brow but nonetheless exuberant movie. Just like the Baron on his horse at the end of ""adventures"", Chow seems to wink: It's silly but fun, hope you enjoyed the show! And yes, I did.",Kung Fu Hustle

This movie has everything in it, great humor, action and a little bit of love thrown in for good measure. I was laughing so hard at the knife scene my eyes were watering!!

267,stufff11,Stay Away,2,26 April 2006,"This movie was so bad it hurt my brain. The plot made absolutely no sense. None. At all. Don't even bother trying to understand what's happening. The character's personalities just jump around randomly, they don't so much develop as the writers just forget everything and start from scratch every 10 minutes, I swear everyone in the film has multiple personality disorder.I guess it was supposed to be funny, but, well, it wasn't. There was a lot of goofy slapstick humor and that was it. I've never been a fan of slapstick myself, but this was poor even for the genre. Not to mention there were elements which were decidedly not funny, like when a bunch of bullys beat up a little deaf mute girl, then beat up and pee all over the face of her would be rescuer. That isn't funny. It isn't made to be funny, but it doesn't go on to illustrate any moral or other meaning either. It's just sort of there for no reason, messing up the already horrid flow of the movie.There's a lot of horrible CGI effects every couple seconds, and a ton of Matrix on a budget fight scenes. I'm not sure how long it actually was, but it seemed like it went on forever, I kept thinking it was about to end and it would take another random plot twist. I saw the dubbed version, and while I would normally never judge anything by the dubbed version, I don't see how this train wreck could possibly be improved upon. A 7.8? Seriously? I give this movie a 2, and that's only because I felt bad for the ice cream girl.",Kung Fu Hustle

Of course first of all this is a action movie that kicks ass. Somehow a modern and truly hilarious kung fu movie. Gong Fu is a movie for everyone. It's a joy for movie fanatics because of its many movie connection. Even though you wouldn't know much of kung fu movie history this one gives you idea how much better it is than mainstream US action kickin' things.Most important thing in Gong Fu is Mr. Chow. How he directed and wrote it and how astonishing he is in the leading role of Sing. It's easy to understand why he has made so many comedies. Chow is absolutely real comedian. He is just so funny.Another important thing is the Chinese language that is spoken in this. Cartoonish violence and real bad ass kung fu and the actors speak Chinese. Gong Fu is ultimately cool, smooth and complete hustle.Hong Kong movie is alive and doing well. China produces great films. Looking forward to successes to come.",Kung Fu Hustle

The situations he writes into the films, along with the other credited writers, are strange and hilarious. But the plot is the only lacking aspect of the film, I think. The story was fun and very entertaining but not fulfilling for me. Of course the special effects and production values were great! This time around, Chow uses LOTS of effects, and the SFX crew does it well. The change from real actors to CGI is good and smooth, even thought the animation isn't fluent. But its a comedy and I'm not complaining. Its even comparable the quality of the Matrix. The acting, also, is quality. Some returning actors from Shaolin Soccer and many new who are charming characters. Unfortunately, the characters are not as in deep or lovable as Shaolin Soccer, especially Sing(CHow), but the cast and characters stand strong on their own without comparison to Chow's precious film. And with Woo-ping choreographing, its looks fast, fluent, creative and professional.Overall, the film is certainly worth one's time.

271,keytofitness,Top Tier Creativity and Comedy,8,12 December 2019,"I must say, I put this movie on with no idea what I was getting myself into.This movie is HILARIOUS. There were so many exaggerated and over the top scenes that made the movie a pleasure to watch. I really loved was how each person had such a different and unique quaily while also playing the stereotypical role they were cast as. Any scene with the landlady just made me burst out laughing. Since this movie came out in 2004, you can expect to see some bad low-end CGI effects (think the live-action Scooby-Doo movies), but you really don't mind since the comedy of the scenes aged relatively well. To be honest, most of the humor was just stupid and immature, but I didn't mind it. I will say that this does lean on the mature end of the movie spectrum, it is rated R, so expect profanity, gore, etc.In the beginning, there seemed to be so many different plots and storylines, that to be honest, I was really confused as to how they would fit them all together. Yet, to my surprise, the storyline converged into one complete and coherent movie relatively easily. I will warn you that the main character is not revealed until after the first quarter of the movieAside from the comedy, this movie has some sick fighting sequences. I say that totally unironically. I mean, yes, they can be TOTALLY over the top and nonrealistic AT ALL, but they sure are entertaining. The creativity put into these fighting sequences is actually quite impressive. The team was really imaginative. The fighting scenes are also vital for the character development of the protagonist Sing (Stephen Chow), so pay attention!I had to watch this movie with subtitles, and let me say that it did not take away from the overall experience at all. After about 10 minutes in, I completely forgot I was even reading them.My one complaint would be that some of the story lines were underdeveloped. I really feel like Sing's romance plot was an afterthought. It kinda just feels like it was unnecessary and didn't add to the overall plot that much. I also feel like the ""axe gang"" was completely undermined. Like after that epic dance scene at the beginning, I had high expectations for them but I was let down by the result.It is obvious that this movie was supposed to be crazy. Most of the humor was based on ironic scenarios, and as cheesy as those can be, I still totally enjoyed it. If you have the time, definitely sit down to watch it. Super conveniently ""Kung Fu Hustle"" is on Nextflix, so it is pretty easy to find. I've seen this movie multiple times, some by myself, some with friends, and some with family, and yet, it continues to be funny each time I watched. There are jokes I still laugh about with my friends today.I definitely recommend this movie, especially to comedy and bad movie connoisseurs! Enjoy!",Kung Fu Hustle
272,webviking6,An Extraordinary Movie,9,16 April 2006,"This movie is really cool. The basic plot involves a guy (Stephen Chow) who wants to get into the Axe Gang in circa 1930 Shanghai by impressing them with how much of an arch criminal he is. He decides to pick on an apartment block inhabited by the working poor and triggers a massive confrontation between the landlady of the block and the working poor on one side and the Axe Gang and their hired thugs on the other. Both sides turn out to be more than they seem and the confrontation quickly escalates into a battle filled with Chinese Magic and Fighting Arts.Wah Yuen steals the show as the iron-fisted landlady, marching around in a silk house robe, hair in curlers, puffing away on her ever present cigarette while shouting orders. Really a fun, fun movie to watch.My only complaint is that some of it is a little hard to follow, and I would blame that on the translation. The movie was made in Chinese and I generally watch foreign language films with the subtitles rather than dubbed, because I like to hear the way the actors sound when they are saying something while I read the subtitle. But the subtitles didn't quite seem right, so I switched to the dubbed version, and that didn't seem quite right either. So I watched it dubbed with the subtitles and half the time the dubbed spoken English didn't agree with the English subtitles. So a really crappy job of translation makes this a 9 instead of a ten.Other than that, the acting, the visual effects, the camera work, the choreography, the comedy, the story are all first rate and make for a spectacular show.",Kung Fu Hustle

The fight sequences are very well-done. The visual effects are surprisingly good (for a Hong Kong movie). Last but not least, the soundtrack is wonderfully pleasant to listen to.

Compared to Shaolin Soccer, this movie is much more sophisticated in terms of plot and effects. Apparent is that Stephen Chow has watched a lot of movies, and when you watch the movie, you will be reminded of that. Kwok Kuen Chan's performance of brother Sum reminds you of Johnny Depp's portrayal of Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean; the cloud effects on several occasions are indeed, as some people have already mentioned, of reminiscent effects in Ghostbusters; the mass scene of one or few heroes against an overwhelming amount of enemies repeats, but with nice comic effects. The kung-fu movies which have had some success in the West, like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; Hero and House of Flying Daggers, are all drama and take themselves very seriously.

This man was one part Charlie Chaplin, one part Bruce Lee, a half a teaspoon Jackie Chan, and an injection of every Looney Toon ever created.This is quite likely how Stephen Chow came into existence.Now imagine that after creating this man, God bestow on him an army of stunt-men, a type writer, a movie camera, a hefty special effects budget, and a eighty wardrobes worth of axes, black suits and top hats.This is quite likely how Kung Fu Hustle came into existence.Ebert has already said that this a movie where Jackie Chan and Buster Keaton meet Bugs Bunny and Quentin Tarantino, but i think that needs to be amended : Imagine a movie where Jackie Chan and Buster Keaton meet Bugs Bunny and Quentin Tarantino, and then the whole crew go to a opium bar for 36 hours. This movie was great, at least as good if not a little better than Shaolin Soccer, the smash hit Chow made back into two thousand. You never doubt the abilities of any random person to be a master of kungfu or, completely not a master of kung fu.Also, the cartoonish beating and contortions that every character seem to be able to endure are so brilliantly installed in the film that despite their utter impossibility, no one ever questions their validity.

It's only until recently with the release of Shaolin soccer did people around the world started to take notice of this Asian pop icon. But when we thought it couldn't get any better, he surprised us with his latest masterpiece, Kung Fu Hustle. Being a die-hard chow fan myself, i must say this is by far the best work he's done. Combining Kung Fu with comedy is something that has been done since the 70's in Hong Kong cinema but very few is as entertaining and spectacular as Kung Fu Hustle. The story is simple. Starting with Chow, a street nobody trying to be a member of the infamous Axe Gang, which pretty much owns everything in Shanghai except a few local small towns that quietly lays outside the city. But it is in one of these small districts that hides the best Kung Fu fighters. In this case, it's District of Pig Cage. With the goal of extending their territories, the Axe gang found themselves in deep trouble as they stumble upon this small town of martial art masters... Viewers will find themselves drawn into the fantasy world of Kung Fu with funny, fascinating characters that blow people's mind away. References to Forrest Gump, The Matrix, Silence of the Lambs, traditional Chinese Woosha novels can be found in many scenes. I also find myself laughing so hard in several parts. Most of the jokes are easy to understand for they are usually short phrases or body movements. This allows general audiences around the world to get pass the cultural or language barrier and enjoy the atmosphere it's creating. The action scenes are also visually stunning according to the design by famous action designer Yuen Ho Ping (Responsible for Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and The Matrix trilogy). But being a long time Kung Fu watcher, i personally thought it would've been even more superior with less cgi. Overall i give it a 9 out of 10. It's probably the most entertaining Chinese film to date. This one will sure save a spot for Steven Chow in the history of Asian cinema. I think the movie comes out worldwide somewhere in March. Hope people around the world can also enjoy this film as much.",Kung Fu Hustle
283,keach,Funny movie,1,16 September 2005,"Plot Outline: Set in 1940s China, the film portrays a young man (Stephen Chow) who wants to be a gangster with the notorious 'Axe Gang' just because being good didn't work for him. KFH includes other characters like the protagonist's fat-lazy sidekick, harp-playing killers, a frail looking beast, a hamlet's domineering landlady and her husband and some of the hamlet's inhabitants who are all apparently Kung-Fu masters! Comment: KFH is yet another Chingi martial-arts movie with flying that defies all laws of Physics. The audience can find some action sequences resembling the Burly Brawl of Matrix Revolutions and some dialogues from Spiderman. One is left wondering whether some of the scenes are to be enjoyed as Action-sequences or pure-comedy.Considering Chow's track record of Shaolin Soccer (2001), he seems to be adept at confusing viewers between Action and Comedy. Performances can be rated as 'decent' from the comical angle. Although SFX is executed neatly, the similarities with Matrix make it seem exaggerated. Unlike Matrix, which was a dream world, Chinese stunt-men simply don't seem to accept physics. Can someone explain me why every other guy in a Chinese movie is a Kung-fu master?

284,JOHNNY-Wu,Inspiring!,10,30 April 2005,"Here's a few tipbit about this movie: He managed to get the legendaries actors in HK to work, one in particular is the actual grandson of the famous Wong Fei Hong (the well-known martial artist, whom Jet Li played several times in the movies such as Once Upon A Time in China I, II, etc).I was blown away with the talent of his when he did Shaolin Soccer, I've watched many of his previous work, they all comedy like and enjoyable but it was as impressive to say it's THAT GREAT, Shaolin Soccer changed it, I've shown it to soo many friends and everyone enjoyed it, I still laugh out loud at the scene when the girl hits her head on the soccer field.. :) Kung Fu Hustle is a more traditional blend, Stephen is a big fan of Bruce Lee so he blended a few more interesting stuff, not to mention, if you have watched many movies coming out past years, Matrix, Kill Bill, etc, you would notice a similarity within, cause he tries to make it a more 'western' acceptable.I enjoyed the re-vamped of classical Chinese music with a contemporary flare, at first, it was hard to digest, but then it blended well...Obviously at some point you can tell the wire-fu connection but overall, this is a really enjoyable movie.Shaolin Soccer inspired me with its unique style which inspired me with my current film A Joker's Card while Kung Fu Hustle went to the next level of comedy mixing with kungfu fighting!",Kung Fu Hustle
285,Savagesweeper,Hollywood wishes they were capable of this,10,23 October 2019,"Kung Fu Hustle is a great parody of martial-arts films as well as being a great martial-arts movie on its own. Taking inspiration from Roadrunner cartoons and Bruce Lee movies, it delivers immensely entertaining action scenes and great performances by the cast along with a well-executed direction by Stephen Chow. A lot of Hollywood martial-arts movies try having a very similar over-the-top tone and comedic antics, and while they can work, they've never achieved anything like this. This is a strong recommendation to anyone who likes martial-arts movies, and even though I never got 100% into them, I still enjoyed every second of this film. It'll make you laugh uncontrollably, it'll make you excited, and it'll keep you gargantuanly satisfied.Rating: A+",Kung Fu Hustle
286,emacs72,A good film for Steven Chow fans,6,14 September 2004,"Only from Steven Chow do we get a martial arts / comedy with references to Shaw Brother films from the 70s, Bruce Lee, Ray Harryhausen, Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner, Matrix Reloaded and Spider-Man. The film is Kung Fu Hustle which had its world premiere at the 29th Toronto International Film Festival. The film opens in Japan on January 15, 2005 and will unspool in other countries thereafter. The film centers around the exploits of a wannabe tough guy (Chow) who unwittingly gets involved in a conflict between the notorious Axe Gang and residents of a housing project. That's pretty much all the plot detail you need as the film is stuffed with wacky bits of slapstick humour and martial arts loosely choreography by Sammo Hung, Yuen Woo Ping and CG artisans.I'll be the first to admit that I just do not ""get"" Steven Chow's brand of comedy. I did watch Shaolin Soccer for what seems like several years ago and found it to be just okay. The good news is that I enjoyed Kung Fu Hustle abit more but not by much. The audience around my friends and I, however, truly and absolutely loved the film. I sat there and perhaps chuckled a few times but found myself thinking about the magnificence that is the HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS which I saw a few days ago.Despite my cool reception to Kung Fu Hustle, I have no doubt this film will be an enormous box-office smash in many parts of Asia. If you love Steven Chow films then Kung Fu Hustle will have you grinning well after the final credits scroll past the screen.",Kung Fu Hustle
287,don-355,You could not find a more entertaining film -- anywhere,10,25 April 2005,"I feel like I do not need to see another fight or action scene in a movie ever again. Nothing could top this! Not the Matrix, not Star Wars, not Spielberg not even the most expensive Hollywood ""block buster."" But there's a BIG difference in the originality, creativity and subliminal nature of this action in a story with lots of heart and humanity at its center. I am amazed ""Kung Fu Hustle"" didn't do better on its opening weekend in wide syndication in the U.S. It took fifth place, even behind new Ashton Kutchner dribble. But I think word-of-mouth will build and this one will be around for awhile in theaters. People will eventually get over going to a subtitled Asian film to recognize they could not find a more entertaining movie -- anywhere. There are scenes, jaw-dropping and breathtaking in their sheer magnificence. They build and build and build until a majestic climax. I saw this in a theater in Queens, N.Y. where the crowd laughed throughout and stood up and applauded at the end. I am also shocked at the R-rating. Beyond a few bloody scenes, mostly at the beginning, there is nothing at all to offend the kids. Most of the violence is cartoonish, fun and with a few exceptions no one actually gets hurt. They could edit out the few lessor violent scenes in order to expose this to a wider audience, especially kids who should open their mind to the real potential of film beyond the stale, clichéd, forgettable Hollywood tripe sure to infiltrate the multiplexes this summer.",Kung Fu Hustle
288,aequitasveritas311,Stephen Chow Rocks!!!,10,17 May 2005,"OHMYGOSH!!! I had so much fun at this movie!! I love that the director has such a wonderful sense of humor. This movie parodied (sp?) so many movies and much more cleverly than Scary Movie (nausea, much) did. I know that there are more than I caught. Just off of the top of my head, I saw references to Shaolin Soccer, The Shining, Gangs of New York, and the Matrix (grr. don't get me started on that movie). Who says that recycling actors can't be fun? I love that the people that the director used in Shaolin Soccer could play such different and fresh characters. There is so much to say about Kung Fu Hustle that I will really have to limit myself to the performance of the actors, as well as the wonderful visual effects. Blood in the halls, frog jumps, and giant hand-shaped hole in a building...there are no words. Oh, wait. I can thing of one: WOW. The visual representations of the more spiritual parts, like the Budda's Palm technique, are very very cool. I agree with one person who said that the effects are imaginative. While they were fantastic, they did not overwhelm the performance of the actors. This is quite a feat, since there are so many effects used. All in all, the actors are fantastic. Wonderful comedic delivery, good use of silence, and dramatic points delivered splendidly as well. Stephen Chow rocks!!!",Kung Fu Hustle

It is clever, funny, and can be seriously good fun with action. Some of the sequences are done with such an artistic flair.The character development is fantastic. The writer carefully and economically fleshes out many characters by not only their dialog but their actions.This is the ""Army of Darkness"" of martial arts movies.

If you haven't seen 'em, SEE THEM ASAP!wow.""EXTRAORDINARY COLLECTION OF SMACKDOWNS""Veering like a drunken driver between naive sweetness and startling cruelty, Kung Fu Hustle is infuriatingly erratic, very, very funny and occasionally just flat-out insane. Chow, who writes and directs, must share credit with fight choreographers Yuen Woo Ping and Sammo Hung. Together they have cooked up an extraordinary collection of smack downs, culminating in a full scale tenement assault that makes a mockery of The Matrix and kicks Gangs Of New York in the gonads.It's not subtle, and it's not clever, but it is fabulous. ~ (Mark Kermode's review for the BBC.)",Kung Fu Hustle
291,Vegaskid,Massive WOW factor!!,9,27 November 2005,"I thought this film was absolutely immense! It is quite possibly the best overall martial arts film I've seen. I sat there for minutes after the end just dribbling.....metaphorically! ;-) When I was younger, I was a big Bruce Lee fan (still am, of course). His films were my yardstick for measuring good martial arts action. Jackie Chan raised the bar in terms of taking the art forward in the medium of film and I am still hugely impressed by the fact he does his own crazy stunts.With the major advances in special effects in the last few years, there has been an explosion of Kung Fu related films, a lot of them in the Crouching Tiger ilk, which goes back to the old school of fantasy fighting, flying through the woods etc. I love these kind of films but they were missing something that I longed for from the Bruce Lee films.Kung Fu hustle combines all the things I like about martial arts films. Great special effects, superb fighting skills, a little bit of a love interest thrown in, the revenge aspect, the 'always a bigger fish' idea, comedy and a good mix of cartoon and brutal violence.Anybody who likes martial arts is gonna love this film, of that I have no doubts. I cant wait for the sequel.",Kung Fu Hustle
292,nathanh-4,"Comedy, Action, Kung Fu... who could want more?",9,20 August 2005,"Stephen Chow demonstrates once again that he's the master of the Kung Fu comedy flick. I haven't been this entertained in a movie theatre since the last time I sat in the back row.Not content to use any basic choreographers, Stephen receives help from the legendary Sammo Hung and Wu Ping Yuen. These two experts of the genre deliver the finest martial arts fight scenes I've seen from any movie. Stephen enhances their choreography with astounding special effects and beautiful camera angles. The wire acting is flawless and blends seamlessly with the CGI.But this isn't just a boring action flick! The script is chock full of sight gags and slapstick. Even the action comes with a side-serving of humour. The characters are over-the-top parodies of Kung Fu stereotypes - the bumbling fool, the evil villain, the mysterious assassin, the serene master - and are played to perfection by the cast. This movie is pure entertainment from beginning to end. Hollywood should start paying attention - THIS is what movies are all about.",Kung Fu Hustle
293,GoddessArtemis85,"Brilliantly written, laugh-your-butt funny",9,14 October 2005,"For those who don't mind reading subtitles, I highly recommend Kung Fu Hustle. As Entertainment Weekly said, ""Think Kill Bill meets Loony Tunes."" It contains spectacular martial arts fight sequences while being refreshingly absurd about it all. And though the comedy factor is very high, the parody aspect doesn't keep you from attaching to the characters and caring about their plight and the resolution of the plot. The script has a peculiar habit of shifting the focus so that, the first time watching it, you really wonder who the main character is. (I'd recommend not studying the movie cover too closely beforehand. Discovering who's really important is half the fun.) All the characters are fleshed out with adorable little quirks that make every single one of them lovable, even the villains. The soundtrack and cinematography were quite enjoyable as well. Overall, Kung Fu Hustle is a delightful piece of art. You'll want to watch it again as soon as you've finished!",Kung Fu Hustle
294,TheVaderCollector,A must see!,10,2 July 2005,"Present movies are more about life's lessons and the horrible consequences of war (a reflection of the times we live in), very few of them are actually meant to entertain us and even the few comedies out there have leaned more and more into scatological humor and innuendo, leaving the young audiences with scarce options. Stephen Chow has the right idea when it comes to movies. Kung Fu Hustle is pure entertainment! The fights are very well choreographed, the humor is light and very physical (everyone will get the jokes), the drama is also light but very well accomplished (you can cry if you want) and to top it all, the special effects are great! It is advisable that you avoid watching it with very young kids, but anyone 13 and above will enjoy it a lot. Watching this movie is bliss. The amalgamation of genres works very well and the pacing is near-perfect with ups and downs at all the right moments. If you want to spend a great weekend night, gather some friends, get some take-out food and watch this movie!",Kung Fu Hustle
295,javalorum,True Martial Arts Movie!,9,11 December 2006,"This is a true Kung Fu movie. I know there're a lot of KungFu movies out there, but IMO (and that's coming from someone who read hundreds of Kung Fu novels multiple times) this one finally got it right. ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" may have got the physical form right, ""Hero"" may have got the mood right, ""House of Flying Daggers"" may have got the romance right, but ""Kung Fu Hustle"" got the ""Kung Fu"" right, or rather, the ""Wu Xia"" right (you'll probably have to wikipedia the word ... since it holds a lot of meanings). The movie has some brilliant scenes with exquisite form and style, like the three masters face the two musicians scene and toad fight scene. However, it's the other parts that shows they truly understand Kung Fu, like how the true masters would rather live in Pig Sty Alley than going out showing the world what they're good at; how a boy with humble backgrounds can eventually become the best martial artist; and especially the ending, when the Beast asks ""What is the name of your technique"" and he answers ""You want to learn? I will teach you!"". That is a very Taoist thing to say. Just that one line could win me over. Kung Fu may seem like it's about fighting and winning, but actually it's also about teaching, preserving, and spreading. And in Kung Fu tradition the latter may be more important than the former. Mortal enemies don't have to stay as enemies, they are really on the same side in the pursuit of great martial art (provided they no longer run around trying to kill people). It's an art form first, fighting skill second. What impressed me most is they delivered this rather serious topic in a simple, fun and cool way. I highly recommend this movie!",Kung Fu Hustle

Those around me laughed at some parts that I found rather offensive as opposed to comical. For example, a group of children urinating on another child is not funny. It is unsanitary and dehumanizing. Please do not laugh. If you do, this is a sure sign that you are not meant to be a parent or work with children -- at least not until you find this as upsetting as I did. I wish I had rented this movie so I could have watched it at home without this constant nervous giggle surrounding me.For those of you who choose to see this movie be warned that this is not the only part that you may find culturally offensive. There is excessive spousal abuse and gay bashing. I would warn you about the violence but it is explicit and actually one of the most entertaining parts of the film.",Kung Fu Hustle
297,cirrus888,My Review,9,7 January 2005,"Kung Fu Hustle99 Mins Distributed by Columbia Pictures Written, Directed and starring Stephen Chow Sing-chi Fight Choreography Yuen Wo PingWell what do you know Yuen Wo Ping was the fight choreographer (how did this bit of information slip under my film radar) and here I was thinking while watching the movie ""we have a matrix imitator here who I must admit wasn't too bad and getting better with each fight"" ... I should have known better that no one does hand to hand combat better than the master himself Yuen Wo Ping.This movie is exactly what the Chinese title says Kung Fu (no Hustle) and even though its directed by Stephen chow half the credit should go to Yuen Wo ping because there are that many fights in this movie more than Crouching tiger, more than house of flying daggers ... its simply action packed with fist to fist combat interspersed with Stephen chow comedy segments (just as funny as those found in Shaolin soccer) and this is where the main difference lies with Stephen's previous effort (the action) and come to think of it with all his other previous films therefore Yuen Wo ping makes this movie his own as much as Stephen Chow does.Action lovers will love this movie!Acting - its so refreshing to see so many old faces in this movie and its a smart move by Stephen as this elevates the movie to something that is not just made for teeny boppers like how the majority of movies are in HK because the movie industry here are so afraid that no one will watch there movies without some current ""fresh face"" who simply can not act or even have a screen presence. The collection of so many fine experience actors in this movie is spot on and gives it more credibility as a movie. Thankfully the one young pop star in this movie is given a non speaking part.Special effects - unlike the matrix the CGI in this movie was again used to enhance the action and the plot like shaolin soccer and there's plenty of it, no complaints.How does it compare with Shaolin soccer? I would say overall its definitely a more complete movie with better acting, better story, better special effects, better characters, just better everything except in one department, the jokes are funnier in Shaolin soccer but only because there were more of them. Kung Fu Hustle has far more action in place of the jokes which is still very HK Cantonese in flavour I'm happy to say while still retaining the universal comedy element that is needed to travel across all cultures.I have nothing but praise for this movie its Stephen's chow's best yet and the 100 million was well spent ... he is a very talented man indeed ... and Yuen Wo ping is THE master of Kung Fu.Story/Plot: Stephen plays a lowlife hustler with ambitions to make it into the biggest triad society because he wants all the riches and women that comes with it but despite his ""big talk"" he doesn't have the heart to do bad.",Kung Fu Hustle

While at times it may feel like Chow isn't quite sure which genre to stay in, they tend to flesh themselves out with the wacky humour and great action sequences. It's rare that I can watch a film now and just be flat-out entertained.

Chinese say that ""Tiger Head, Snake Tail"", which means big starting, small ending. The ending of this movie is too soon. Chow is extremely weak before, never learns KungFu from others before, even an old lady can beat him, and then he changes to be ""SUPERMAN"" suddenly. The story actually still works, but you might feel everything goes too quick finally. Therefore, I am thinking Chow is going to release a DIRECTOR-CUT version later, just like what he did for ShaoLin Soccer in HongKong (this is business).And, compared it to Chow's other productions, this movie almost depends on action, even the funny stuffs, so it lacks much language fun (I saw all of his other movies, many times). I don't blame him because I know he wants to enter Hollywood. I just want to say, Chow has changed, not just this in the movie, his style has changed.Anyway, this movie is really entertained.

305,perrin99,Much hustle about kung fu,10,9 January 2005,"I have mostly good things to say about Stephen Chow's latest movie.Kung Fu Hustle, for the most part, is unlike Chow's previous, award-winning action-comedy, Shaolin Soccer, although he has obviously continued the martial arts theme and expanded (massively) his repertoire of sfx.I am a Chow fan, beginning from the times when he relied on a deadpan expression, toilet humour, spoofs of other movies and books, and good-ending, heart-warming, small-town/village boy-makes-good story lines.Some of those elements are noticeably absent in KFH. Ng Man Tat is missing, as is the customary female attraction (the main female character has little screen time). The cast of SS is back (excepting Ng), and the goalkeeper of that movie in particular has a roaring time here as the leader of Axe Gang.But of course, when it comes to KFH, one must talk about the sfx. In themselves they are creatively-done and quite out of the world. As part of the film, one might ask, has Chow stumbled into the cinematic abyss that has caught so many of Hollywood's directors who dabble in the black arts of sfx? Thankfully, the answer is no. True, KFH, unlike SS, is weak on story and characters, which has been characteristic of recent Western yawns such as Van Helsing, Blade Trinity etc. In this, Chow has stepped away from the formula which made SS not just a sfx extravaganza but a successful story. In contrast KFH is a bundle of action sequences thrown together to showcase the sfx.But the wit and cheekiness of Chow remains. It is gratifying that the fun and sarcasm that has been a hallmark of his acting career have translated themselves well into films that he has produced and directed.So in KFH we have Chow spoofing the clichés of Chinese martial arts stories: the retired martial arts couple who become petty scrooge and lecher, the heroes who save the neighbourhood (one of them gay) end up getting dispatched soon after, and the con beggar who sells a wu ling mi ji to a naive boy.Because of the spoofs, the sfx don't become spectacles in themselves, but help to drive the madness upward. Highly-skilled sitar players strum out blades and ghouls in battle, a pugilist using the Toad's Skill croaks and blows out his lower mouth like one, Chow ascends into the skies as he masters the Buddha's Palm with a eagle in the distance, the engrossing mass battle with the black-clad Axe Gangsters, lifted from the Matrix movies. It is all mad, irreverent and at times even affecting.Still, I do yearn for the good o' Chow. The sfx are fun and crazy. But surely the funniest bit in the film has got to be the knife-throwing sequence. That is good o' Chow. So I don't mind, just bring on the Chow, be it old or new, in the next year.",Kung Fu Hustle

Now that is for the Asian version. (Un)Lucky me, i also managed to watch the version released in the US. What on earth was that!?! Why do they even bother to release it?! Back to Kung Fu. The trailers were superb. I remember watching it the first time in my office. I burst out laughing at the line where he asked the lady with the spring onion to come out for a fight. Pure genius and perfect comic timing. Having watched it like 15 times (and still laughing), the next trailer was about him getting slapped on the train. Then the trailer with him satiring Shaolin Soccer with the line "" NO MORE SOCCER"". I thought that was incredibly smart. At that point, I know this is one movie i will pay with my limbs to watch.Entering the cinema, my heart was beating fast and my hands trembling! When the butterfly circled around the word 'Kung Fu', it was almost too overwhelming! 3 1/2 years after watching some bald monks kicking a ball in the opening of Shaolin Soccer, i told myself "" THIS IS IT!""Roughly 94 minutes later, i told myself ""That is not a Chow Sing Chi movie!"" Using my purely unprofessional critical skill, this is how i assess what went wrong in the movie. (in my opinion)1. He hardly has much dialogue in the movie! Let alone funny ones! The only funny lines are very much exposed in the trailers. His character is also somewhat secondary. He just stumbles upon the plot in the beginning and conveniently wraps up the story in the end! Even his fighting moves is not as extravagant as the others. 2. The reason Shaolin Soccer was so successful was because of the development of the characters, coherency in the plot and a fine story-telling skill. Having crafted some colorful characters in Kung Fu, they are severely underutilized! What bother imposing the Axe Gang as extremely terrifying in the opening scene where in the later parts of the movie they are just one-dimensional, stereotypical 'punching bags' with clownish head honchos? Why bother building such a magnificent neighborhood (pig sty) if you don't bother to exploit more thoroughly? In the opening scene, its inhabitants were really interesting, but sadly, just like the building, there are not given their much deserved focus. Even the Fatty sidekick were given lines that he couldn't deliver well to get laughters from us (except the knife throwing part)3. With a running time of 95 minutes, the story is chasing after itself. At this point i'm wondering, "" is it because of the Hollywood market?"" The plot may be simple, but no emphasis were given to the story telling. The ending was so abrupt that it leaves a feeling of disbelief in me. Everything was going fine and then BAM, its over. (reminded me much of King of Comedy). If more time were given to the audience to grasp all the actions, the story would have been more coherent. Spare some time to show us how Sing get his power(rather than explaining it in a few lines), have some resolutions to other characters rather than ignoring them completely, and then wrap it all up with finale. An extra 1o-15 minutes would have done the trick!4. As much as I'm impressed with the CGI, I ask myself, is this how you entice the Yankees? With Star Wars and co. coming out soon, this may be a little risky. Yuen Wo-Ping did a great job, but it has a somewhat been-there-done-that feeling.I can't believe I'm bashing his movie but this is my sincere opinion. Though it didn't stopped me from watching it for another 2 times, this is to me not a Chow Sing Chi movie but a CGI-driven Kung Fu movie with cameo appearance from him.P/S: In an interview later, Sing admitted that this is not his conventional movie but purely a tribute to the Kung Fu genre. Well, whatever it is, I will still continue to watch his movies (bring on the DVDS) NO MATTER WHAT. I just hope it won't take another 3 1/2 years!",Kung Fu Hustle

From Serigio Leonne to Warner Brothers Cartoons,nothing is left out, and you really do not mind being taken along for the ride. It does not take a psychic to see where the road in this movie is going, yet, though the scenery may be obvious, it is very enjoyable. Hilarious comedy, mixed with action, kung fu mastery, Road Runner styled chases, and unfortunately all to short dance scenes. Saw this with my 18 year old son, and though he was reluctant to go see this particular film, he was nearly choking on his popcorn from laughter.

The thing that i can see being a problem is the script, and the silly moments, if your a ""casual"" movie goer then it could turn you off, but even so the films fights alone should be enough to entertain you, this is not a serious film, have fun with it.

Steven Chow does a fine job of directing and manages to make this hodgepodge of ""Looney tunes"" humor, added with a touch of Tarantino and ""Matrix"" work. In addition he plays the part as Sing , the ne'er-do-well who finds his calling but Wah Yuen and Qiu Yuen steal the show. The action and laughs are aplenty.

In addition, Jackie Chan and Buster Keaton at the same time.I have not seen a movie that is so successful a mix of styles and still has its own style. When you're doing comedy, it's very difficult to keep the tone of the gags , especially in acting and mise–en-scene, a tone that is always on the verge to go to failure , but still floats fresh and chic. You even laugh at the graphic effects . I can imagine what the reaction was in the cinemas , when the audience was mass ""lifted"" after a couple of good jokes and than start to laugh at each and every tiny antic. See once this movie or download it from the net – be sure that it is in Chinese with the translation. Dubbed versions (translated into English ) will not do . This film has the same value for Kung Fu genre as ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" has for the ""spaghetti western"", as "" Singing in the Rain"" has for the musical , as "" A Night at the Opera "" has for screwball comedy , as ""Meals on wheels "" has for the action movies - the best that genre can offer.Mustafa Presheva",Kung Fu Hustle
316,Brutusbiker,Great entertainment!!!,10,7 January 2006,"I am no big kung-fu movie fan, but this really doesn't matter, as this is not a kung-fu movie -- at least not in the sense that ""Hero"" or ""The Tiger and the Dragon"" were. This movie is pure joy, and the kung-fu setting is merely incidental. I watched this movie on the plane, and it was so much fun that I think I kept the other people in my row awake because I was laughing aloud the whole time. The gags are very well made. The whole tone of the film is very tongue in cheek, but absolutely not pretentious. And although the humor is unpretentious and very visual, it is by no means slapstick. There are clear good-natured references to other recent movies, but this movie is not a parody or a satire. In fact, I find it hard to classify this movie. It is neither high-brow nor low-brow. It is neither Steve Martin nor Leslie Nielsen. This is John Candy and Steve Martin together, as in ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"", with action scenes directed by James Cameron! It is one of the funniest action movies I have ever watched! I highly recommend it to good-natured, fun-loving people. I would watch it again over and over. I believe this is going to become a cult movie in the future. It is utterly original, intelligent and lovingly made.",Kung Fu Hustle
317,nighthawk936,A work of art on the TV screen depicting Chinese wuxia culture,10,28 July 2006,"I've seen many reviews about this movie, and heard from my friends on how good the movie is, but I have never had the chance to see it for myself until last night. The movie is absolutely a piece of art representing many of the Chinese wuxia culture. This is actually the point of my summary about this movie this time instead of the overall. This is because many people had already given enough appreciations to the movie's storyline and ""slapstick humor"",that I feel I can move onto something that many people haven't talked about, and that is the Wuxia culture within. In the beginning we see the three man fighting the army of the Axe Gang, and from there we see their different kung fu techniques. If one knows of Huang Fei Hung, the old man with the rings around his fist represent the ""Metal Wire Fist"", a renowned technique. The man with amazing kicks has the kung fu called ""Tam Legs"", while the man who mastered the ""stick techniques"" is actually the famous ""Yeung family halberd techniques"" of China back during the Song dynasty. The trio represented their techniques and the spirit of Chinese wuxia (and kung fu) culture: modesty and righteousness. How about Stephen Chow? He knows the Buddha Palm, which is in the story Yu Lai Shen Jiang. (ironically, his archenemy FIre God Devil would be his master in the original story). How about the couples? The loudmouth landowner actually knows the Lion Roar, while her husband knows the Tai Chi techniques. Both couples are extraordinary in the movie, as they revealed that their disgusting image given to the audiences in the beginning had merely been only a disguise to their true selves. As extraordinary as they are, in real life the husband Yuen Wah is actually the colleague of Bruce Lee. True kung fu masters he is. How about the archenemy? His desire to seek defeat was satire to JinYong's Shao Au Jiang Wu and Shen Diao Xia Lu's ""the alone seeks defeat"", where in these two stories the winner traveled far and wide to look for challenges. Near the end, the Toad Attack used by the archenemy was OuYengFung's attack in the Condor Trilogy. The character was evil, and his attack was known to be notorious in the Trilogy. Same as in KungFu. FOr those who understand the Chinese Wuxia, this attack would seem not only funny, but knowing its origin and how it fits the role of the Fire Cloud Devil as he's evil here. How about in the end? When the beggar shows another kid several of his manuals, I laughed hard at the sight. All the manuals were of a very powerful kungfu in a certain Wuxia story, such as ""Jiu Ying/Yang Jenggong"" and the ""Yi Yang Ji"", which are from Jinyong's Condor Trilogy, just to name a few. Why are these so funny and significant? This is because not only is the movie done so well, the story so well written, but also that it uses these kungfu techniques from various wuxia series to decorate the movie into a piece of art heavily saturated with wuxia theme and culture. To many non wuxia readers and common foreigners, they seem like nothing. But to those who read wuxia and understand a bit of Chinese culture, this is a magnificent work of art to express Chinese culture. Once again Stephen Chow has once again overwhelmed Jackie Chan and show what is true kung fu. Heroes are never required.",Kung Fu Hustle
318,thaoho-89888,One of Stephen Chow's best,10,22 March 2016,"I've seen all of Stephen's movies. All of the 1990's one are his funniest movies, but Kung Fu Hustle is what his heart truly wants. All of those people who said that he did not put his heart into making this movie are basically shallow. All of his ridiculous comedy movies were not written by him, he just acted because he liked acting, not because he liked the plots that those writers wrote. He wanted to earn enough money so that he could make his own movies, which reflected what he truly loved. He loves and respects Kung Fu. This is the reason why Kung Fu Hustle did not include lots of funny scenes like other movies that he starred in. He wanted to focus more on Kung Fu and less on slapstick. I respect Stephen Chow for what he has done. This movie totally got me. It teaches me that being the strongest means being able to inspire others. Asian movie cannot surpass Western movie in term of CGI, but it definitely has more meaningful lessons that the audience can learn from.",Kung Fu Hustle
319,zielzibub,a nice light and entertaining movie,6,23 August 2005,"When one watched the trailer of kung fu hustle, one realised that one could expect an intelligent movie that parodied the kung fu movies of yore.And when i watched the movie, i got much more! it is a sort of - parody as well as a tribute - a wonderful mix of over the top and subtlety.Stephen Chow's character is nicely underplayed and subtle. the references to other films are delightful. the best one for me was the scene where one of the slum dweller's is dying and the landlord and landlady are mourning over him. and the guy, while dying, says...""what are you willing to do!"" in English!! and the landlord and landlady reply in Chinese ""why are you speaking in English, we can't understand you"" while still crying. the obvious reference to ""The Untouchables"" where Sean Connery exalts in the same way to Kevin Costner is just hilarious.To know that the film is funny when watching it with subtitles makes you appreciate how funny it must be in the original language.special effects and sub plots too are very interesting. all in all it is a film that can be watched just to enjoy the visual spectacle as well as by the cinema goer who seeks out the subtleties of cinema.A good entertainer. In his day Jackie Chan came up with some wonderful rib ticklers that mixed kung fu with slapstick and over the top acting and situations. And although this cannot compare totally to his achievements considering the time they were made...it definitely is a good movie on its own.One of the few movies that stands out in originality, creativity and brash ""in your face"" attitude among its contemporaries.",Kung Fu Hustle
320,prohibited-name-2984,Zenith!,10,15 December 2005,"I vote it a 10 for what it is aims to be -- the epitome of the genre that Stephen Chow makes all his films in -- a kungfu fantasy. This is stated first as I understand it was badly panned in the US for being shallow, in contrast to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. By tapping Yuen Wo Ping's experience from the Matrix, he finally achieves the effects, to a very large extent, of the kungfu novels we read. His previous attempts to imbue effects into kungfus movies were quite good, without any of the ""japanisation"" of design that seem to prevail in the other HK movies. He uses anime gags, true, but his movies' references will not alienate the older audiences. Watching KungFu made me excited, it was like watching the genre finally getting the ultimate blockbuster treatment. On a CG level, it was satisfying but I am personally a nitpickler for realism. It was the choreographed scenes that made it shine. If you'd watched Matrix 2 and this, you'd draw the easy comparison in the group-fight scene of hero vs suits. Except where in M2 it was all badly-done CG, here it was a true dance between stuntmen and CG. I suspect Yuen was the driving force for this human aspect, and their choice of ex-kungfu movie actors was not only to draw the older audiences -- but to enable realistic kungfu moves enhanced with CG. Compare the fight scenes here with those in the HK idol-fantasy flicks and you can really tell the immersion. Near the end, there was a brilliantly executed series of leaps by Stephen Chow. It really looked like he was leaping than dragged on wires or CG (like the Frog scenes). Well done, Stephen! Keep it up! Explore the rest of the moves!",Kung Fu Hustle

A martial arts film with special effects? Phooey! But the movie had me hooked. It is the movie I enjoyed most that year. It is truly as fresh and new a movie that has been made in the action comedy genre.Stephen Chow has used himself effectively, not allowing his character to overshadow the movie. As a result other endearing characters are brought into light. Savage humor and imaginative fight direction makes the movie enthralling. The background music fits right in.

He then proceeds to demolish the axe gang members one by one while his brothers in arms join him in the fight.Without further knowledge one would think that these 3 and especially Coolie was our main protagonists only later to find out this wasn't the case.Even though the movie takes lot's of liberties when it comes to the laws of physics the movie still portrays accurate martial arts when it comes to fighting which I love.All in all I strongly encourage you to watch this movie and make and set an opinion of your own.

324,Buddy-28,Awesome!!,10,14 May 2005,"I did not know what to expect of this movie other than what the trailer showed, but I was completely blown away by this film! Not only does it pay homage to the Matrix and Spiderman as well as Looney Tune cartoons but the opening with the butterfly paid homage to the Men In Black with the dragonfly flying through the opening credits. From that point on, I was totally swept up in the movie and the 95 or so minutes seemed to go by in no time at all! The effects were well within the atmosphere presented by this action/comedy and I found myself laughing at all the jokes presented as well as feeling for the character of Sing as he blundered his way through trying to be a gangster even though he was way in over his head.Scene after scene flowed with maybe some exceptions here and there, but all in all held together and kept my attention. I, too could have watched this movie without the subtitles and have enjoyed it just as much. The tonal sounds of Brother Sum, the language itself added to the beauty of this film, I could close my eyes and listen to it and be swept away. If the language was not so hard to master at such a point this far in my life, I would love to be able to learn it just to get the true dialogue they were speaking.From the background story of Sing to the rag tag collection of people living in Pig Sty Alley to the seemingly inept but fear in sheer numbers of the Axe Gang, this film has enough characters to satisfy anyone. They each have a place in the movie and I don't think it would be the same without them.The story, cinematography, the effects(at times obviously CG but they fit within the context of the film), the characters and even the music all make this a memorable viewing, enough to put this in my collection of films that I could watch over and over without growing tired of it.There is so much I actually enjoyed of this film, I would love to dig deeper into the career of Stephen Chow. I had not heard of him before this viewing, but I would like to see if his other films were as entertaining.If you like movies that have martial arts, enough action and comedy to spare with a story strong enough to hold it all together, I would recommend you catch this movie.

It is a beautiful story that beholds complex emotions from the beginning to the end.
Sing, a young boy, gets beaten up by some bullies for trying to stop them from snatching a girl's candy.
Confused, sad Sing thinks that bad guys always win, so he decides to go off the rails and aspires to be a gangster by joining the Axe Gang.
Somehow, after multiple failed attempts, he manages to join the Axe Gang along with his friend ""Bone"".
As an Axe Gang member, he eventually gets to know the dangers and life-threatening risks his job possesses.
Subconsciously, he knows that Bone might get killed if he (Bone) continues this job.
Following a bad encounter with the landlady of Pig Sty (a slum) and a fight with a bus passenger (in which he didn't use any Kung Fu moves), his willingness to save his friend from this dangerous job grows strong.To accomplish this, he playfully beats his friend and warns him not to follow him, implicitly disassociating Bone from the Axe Gang.During a fight in which the Beast gets grabbed in a submission hold by the Couple (Landlord and landlady of Pig Sty), Axe Gang Boss orders Sing to attack the couple.
After being in a dilemma briefly, he rather chooses to hit the beast with a stick, reflecting his true nature of punishing the nefarious guy/s.Ultimately, he fights the beast one on one and defeats him (the beast) maneuvering The Buddha Palm Kung Fu techniques.
As a gesture of compassion, he leaves the Beast alive, but trickster, ungrateful Beast attacks Sing with a metal Rose-like weapon which has a sharp needle at the front.
Sing again neutralises his (the beast's) attack.
In this instance, the beast gets blown away by the mightiness of Buddha Palm Kung Fu and surrenders to Sing.

330,sulpher,"Many things are good, not many are great.",9,29 October 2006,"I will limit my review to one scene as many people here have given very in depth and concise reviews of the film as a whole.My scene of choice is ""the blind lire assassin"". (one of the two fighters that use stringed instruments)...Firstly, there is a scene that primes you for the sort of skill these guys have. A man walks past one of the players as he tunes his instrument, what happens next is what I would class as one of the top primes for an upcoming scene ever. As the music plays you see various subtle interactions between the music and the power it holds. Twigs and leaves are cut, eves are disturbed and foliage is russelled. This ends with a fatal chord.Let me just review this. The setting for this scene is awesome, the colours and lighting in combination with the CGI and camera angles are something to aspire to. The music is given a physical presence by the magic of film. Just the concept realisation that a musical instrument when played can be a deadly weapon is something the western world would never conceive of nor dare to use in a film, makes this scene and the main musical battle scene one of the best realised moments in film ever.I have never seen 30 seconds of better designed film in my life unless i discount the main musical battle scene. The main scene I just will not describe. You will have to see it to understand how near to perfection it is.Hollywood has a long way to go to match what HongKong is doing with CGI and 35mm now. The only difference is that Hollywood can out hype all other production communities in the world. Lets face it. What America produces in film, it has already sold by ramming it down our throats for the months leading up to the release.HK will some day outstrip the US in the film world.

332,phoebidas,Over-CGI,6,31 March 2005,"I saw this film late, after everyone else in hong Kong had raved about it. But the general gist of comments from the initial release was that it wasn't as funny as Shaolin Soccer, but it was a far more visually attractive movie.So, someone gave me the vcd and I was expecting lush 30's Shanghai scenes a la Wong Kar Wai with moody 30's music and some laughs.Well it did that, sort of.I suppose if one is to fully appreciate the film, then one must view it through 'Hong Kong slapstick mode' comedic lenses. Personally I favour more subtle humour, like the recent 'Life Aquatic', where the humour is much more understated.Which is not to say that the film is not funny. It is, but I have always found that Mr Chow's main strength in comedy has been in the brilliant cantonese dialogue he manages to conjure up in his films. There is less of this in KFH, where most of the laughs were slapstick gags, but there were one or two moments which were really quite good. Like the Shining reference for example.Finally - CGI. While the HK movie industry has increasingly employed the use of CGI in movies, Chow being one of the pioneers; The CGI effects in this film were totally over the top. I felt myself consciously trying to suspend disbelief throughout, and the 'roadrunner' sequence I felt just broke the whole rhythm of the movie, and I found myself squirming in my seat. If only they could tone down the CGI, make the fight sequences more realistic (either using higher quality CGI or just make it less bizarre), then it might have been more palatable.In summary, this is a film which promised a stylish action comedy, aimed probably at a more western audience, but ultimately fell short due to an almost looney tunes type quality. But understandably it is difficult to satiate all tastes when it comes to comedy, and by leaving the more comfortable territory of traditional HK humour, The films shortcomings may have been due to Mr Chow stepping into a somewhat unfamiliar territory of higher budget comedy films whilst simultaneously trying to cater to different audiences.A brave step which should be applauded, and I look forward to the next film.",Kung Fu Hustle

334,armaniboi,"Odd, yet Entertaining Ride",7,21 April 2005,"I did not read about this movie before I saw it as what I usually do with lots of Hong Kong films. However, upon watching the film, you realize very quickly that there isn't a story - or at the very least I should say it is extremely lacking. But even then, this isn't to say that the film is very entertaining and surprisingly at times, very endearing.If you are a fan of Hong Kong films, and what I mean by that is by older films like those that have started and continued to spur Hong Kong cinema, then you will notice many references to these films. The first and most prominent is probably the reference to ""House of 72 Tenants"" with the ""sassy"" landlord and disputes over water to her use of language. As this film was a film that made Hong Kong cinema prominent again as opposed to mandarin cinema, it might be a reference to an unconscious or conscious desire for Stephen Chow and others that want Hong Kong cinema to thrive again.But even if you haven't watched old Hong Kong films, you still can watch this film and be entertained. You are engaged in this entertaining ride with fight scenes, slapstick comedy, subtly beautiful characters and only do you stop to question what the film is about because that is a question that people ask in every film. Even though the answer you find is that there really is no story or that the entertainment factors vastly outweigh the story and can be seen as a fatal flaw to a film to certain people, it is still something that should be watched and then you can decide for yourself.",Kung Fu Hustle
335,aakuntz,A great comedy with great action,9,5 July 2011,"Stephen Chow brings comedy and Kung Fu to the silver screen in this tribute to the classic Jackie Chan Kung Fu movies.What makes Kung Fu Hustle different from other Chinese Kung Fu movies released around the same time is its humor. While Chinese films such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Hero may retell or reinvent the serious Kung Fu myths, Kung Fu Hustle makes its mark by injecting cultural reference, especially to the 1940's American Gangster, and humor, both slap-stick and referential.Though the film starts slowly, don't abandon it too early! Kung Fu Hustle's humor takes time to get used to, but quickly becomes enjoyable and evident, even in the midst of serious action sequences. If you enjoyed Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, love funny movies with good action, or are just looking for a Kung Fu movie, this is the one for you!",Kung Fu Hustle

I'm going back in about 3 hours, better take a crash cart with me. I love that among all th violence he manages to throw in a cute little love story.

From Chow's every movie, i get the info from his humor, that is average people get the biggest lives, and that's why i'm quite IN his movies.Kungfu Hustle, this latest one, is a real cool! I can relax myself and laugh in ease with the familiar Chow's style.Every characters act in the old Shanghai mood, and that's really attracting. Whole story tells in a fluent way, like a way of Kungfu.When I catch this film, i just thought it'd another Chow's old style one. But this is real overpass my imagination.

After spending approximate 100mins in the movie theater we were extremely satisfied and entertained. This movie is even better than we have expected. There were full of laughters almost from the beginning to the end in the theater. Stephen Chow displays his talent as both a director and an actor. It maintains the previous Chow's style and humor as in other movies, such as ""Xi Ju Zhi Wang"" and ""Xing Yun Yi Tiao Long"", while those CGIs were not expected. In Chow's movie, what the Chinese people like is that it says no to super heroes. It just tells the stories of ordinary people, particularly those people leading insignificant and unsuccessful lives. Several characters in this movie were played by popular Kung-Fu stars, in the 1980's - 1990's in China. Stephen Chow shows respects to them, as the way he respects Bruce Lee. Above all, Kung-Fu Hustle is a movie with great hilarity, stunning CGI effects, fantastic Kung-Fu, and the lives of ordinary people. I give it 9 out of 10. Highly recommended!Now this movie is in theaters in Europe and North America. The recent comments have shown a good sign already.Best wishes to Stephen Chow! Hope western people like this movie as well.",Kung Fu Hustle
340,bali4life,Ultimate kung-fu comedy,9,1 November 2005,"Hi all, I started watching Kung-fu hustle out of sheer boredom on my flight to Japan. I expected it to be another boring martial arts movie with clichéd story lines and bad acting. What I found was an amazingly entertaining, crazy, novel story with slap-stick comedy that had me laughing my *ss off loud. Stephen Chow is definitely putting China on the world cinema map with his genre of movies. The action is of course not real and has used computer effects - but I don't believe Chow is trying impress everyone just by having real martial arts a la Ongbak. He is an entertainer like Jackie Chan was in his prime. He even takes a cheeky punt at western movies like the Matrix and Spider-man which is pretty cool. The story of Kung-fu hustle itself is set in a sort of 70's China and people like me who love travelling and different cultures get a real feel of being in China. The story throws up a lot of crazy surprises like that of a children's fairy tale and is very funny and refreshing. I watched Kung-fu hustle a few times now and bought it on DVD and cant wait for his next movie. Kung-fu hustle gets a well deserved 9/10",Kung Fu Hustle

I think most people get carried away with pointing out the little details in movies when whats really important for this type of movie is how much you enjoyed it. This movie was definitely one of the most enjoyable movies I have ever seen. It's got the coolest characters which I say reminds me of looney toons and still the action is cool. It's fake out of this world kung fu action but the moves where still performed very skillfully and the movie really had something to it that a lot of other movies didn't. It was simply just fun to watch. I watched it twice already and my girlfriend was just asking to see it again. Her dad watched it and kept saying how good it was. I definitely recommend this movie.

This movie has it all from story, characters, action and plot. You can't help feeling... why aren't there more movies like this? The build up during the end of this movie is fantastic.

344,HotIndieNews,KUNG FU HUSTLE may leave you feeling a little ripped off.,5,8 April 2005,"KUNG FU HUSTLE may leave you feeling a little ripped off.Well, it's been about a week since attending a special press screening for KUNG FU HUSTLE, and unfortunately I still feel as if I've been ripped off. Maybe I just expected too much from this movie due to all of the talent that was involved, both in front of the camera and behind the scenes.This may explain why rather than feeling totally satisfied in seeing an entertaining spoof on classic Hong Kong cinema with a 2005 twist, I have nothing but questions.If this is supposed to be a comedy, then why am I not laughing that much?Is it be possible that most of the witty dialogue was lost in translation from it's original language to subtitles?Did KUNG FU HUSTLE fall victim to additional editing by Sony Pictures Entertainment, so that they could cram more showings of this film into their affiliated multiplexes?If so, could this be the reason why Sony changed the title from Gong Fu (it's original 2004 name) to KUNG FU HUSTLE?I have so many more questions, am I just being a bit too critical?Perhaps I am just being too critical. Basically, KUNG FU HUSTLE is the simple story of a small time thief named Sing (played by Stephen Chow) who believes that becoming a member of a ruthless ax wielding gang will finally give him happiness. Of course, this is not the lesson that you should to walk away with, so our once good guy turned bad must defeat his past and present demons and become a good guy once again.Visually this movie is quite entertaining even though at times the computer generation seems to slightly take away from the fight choreography of Yuen Wo Ping (Kill Bill, The Matrix, Crouching Tiger), and Sammo Hung (The Medallion, Knock Off, Double Team). However, Dragon Ball Z fans will definitely get a kick (no pun intended) out of the final battle between Sing and The Beast (played by Leung Siu Lung).One thing for sure, this movie is now sending me on a quest to learn Cantonese and find it's original 2004 version (Gong Fu) to see if there was any additional character development that may have been excluded from this release.So look forward to a follow up review in the near future :-)Favorite Super Power: Landlady's Lion RoarJames Lane, HotIndieNews.com",Kung Fu Hustle
345,GWing_02,Extremely well made,9,6 May 2005,"Going into the movie, I wasn't sure how it would pan out, having seen the trailer and expecting a cheap Matrix spoof. However, the movie surprised me by remaining incredibly fresh and funny.Just a warning: I watched the Chinese version of the movie, and there were quite a few jokes that I don't know would translate well to English (a few puns, a couple idiomatic sayings), so it may be a completely different experience with the subtitles.The first half of the movie kind of passes by in a sort of confused daze as you don't know what's going on whatsoever and the jokes are on the cheap side. However, towards the middle of the movie, an actual plot begins to take stride and both the action and the humor picks up. By the end of the movie, I was simply blown away at how good the special effects were and how all the loose ends of the story were neatly tied up.All in all, it was an exceptionally well put-together movie with great visual effects and decent humor, even if it takes about an hour to actually get into stride.",Kung Fu Hustle

If you like KungFu and comedy's, you'll love this film. There seems to be lots of new faces, I wonder if maybe Stephen Chow got lucky and come across a school of KungFu master's, who just so happened to be great actors at the same time?

The mixture of comedy and Kung fu to extremely original and the acting is fine, the story great, the fights are impressive and original. It's silly, and funny, and bloody. A Quintine Tarratino, Matrix, Road Runner mixture that works. The most entertaining film I've seen in years. It should have done better at the box office, but it'll live forever on video. It's a gang war, comedy, kung fu, underdog, love story. But it works, and you'll be entertained. The physical comedy was the best I've seen recently.

The fights are very well choreographed and blended perfectly with the modern affects you will see in the new martial arts films. But I have to say that this is not just another film produced on that bandwagon. As this film has a jet lee type fight scenes with a Jackie Chan twist. The story line is still the same old classic though of a bum who makes good in the end. With out giving to much away in case you see it and you should see it, I consider the end boss to be one of the best around in which he has a very, very special gong fu style.

I have to say though that living in Scotland as I do, Mrs. Landlady reminds me all too easily of Scottish women - and I mean that in the nicest possible way.

I guess you have to be a real fan of this genre to enjoy this movie. I bored myself to death in the cinema. The humor is very childish, the characters are blunt and irritating. The plot and/or story are of no relevance at all. It's all about the fighting moves. I cannot say if the're good or not because I don't often go to this kind of movie and after watching this one, I'll doubt if I'm going again.

This film was perfectly well set in the 1930's scene. The fight sequences absolutely pummels the Matrix Trilogy into a puddle. The fight sequence are jaw dropping with added comedy makes this film absolutely brilliant in many ways.

Amazingly directed, HILARIOUSLY funny, it blends a 1930s gangster stylishness into a Hong Kong kung fu movie to astonishing results. Who would've thought you could top Shaolin Soccer? Not me, until I saw this movie. Stephen Chow pulled it off. Chow's comedic timing gets better and better with every movie he makes, and while his films are depending more and more on CGI these days, and makes this movie much more a fantasy kung fu film than a traditional one, it hardly detracts from the enjoyable experience.

A real movie fan would find these movies have weak stories. (like 'The day after tomorrow', scenes are incredible but story is very weak).As a huge star in Asia since1990s, Stephen Chow finally moved his movies to the worldwide including earlier 'Shaolin soccer'. The English subtitle is not very satisfying, sometimes just uses simple translations for these funny conversations. Kung Fu parts are very good, very enjoyable.

Further, I didn't enjoy the twists and turns of the plot, that don't make sense and could've been done way better. Several scenes were funny, the acting was more than half descent, there were some touchy scenes, and overall it feels like this movie is a great miss, rather than a great his.

The film has virtually the same theme and setting of ""Gangs of New York"" and still managed to create likable characters. Even though this is seemingly a more serious film than Shaolin Soccer, it still has the playful humor that made it such a fun movie. Kung Fu Hustle is a great mix of action cinematography and cartoon like special effects.

My friends from India wanna watch this movie since this is the first time they visit Malaysia. But they went to cinema twice after this movie released in nation wide, they still can't get a single ticket not even in the first row... eventually they got a chance to watch this movie in cinema... which was one month later. In south east Asia it is common that people do watch pirated DVD and CD... this is the first time that pirated sold out in first 2 weeks... bear in mind that the odds that people watch pirated DVD is 10 to 1 versus people watch in the cinema... so take a real guess the actual number of times people watch this movie in South East Asia. Personally i watched it over 20 times... and like many of others i actually went online research the making of this movie... Stephen chow unlike the one showing in the movie as in the real life he is indeed a very demanding and serious type of person. He actually took himself in the position of director, actor as well as script writing. Many of the pig sty city research in details from the 1940s of the Shang Hai model of life style and even of the many actors and actress are carefully chosen among the crowd... some even share the same title with Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan aka the ""3 dragon"". Many of the fans were very worried when during the filming process there are actually quarrels between some casting crew with Stephen Chow and people left the job cause of the over demanding of details in making such movie. I personally pay a great respect to Stephen Chow not just that he can act, script writing and directing a movie but his spirit and passion to make a good movie which inspired a lot by Bruce Lee...I won't touch the story of the movie.. well u can watch the movie yourself and make your own judgement. =)",Kung Fu Hustle

I did not know Stephen Chow until yesterday, when I heard a Radio Jockey speak about the movie 'Kung Fu Hustle'. It had been some years since I watched a Kung Fu flick and as the Radio Jockey had given a positive recommendation, I decided to watch the movie.If I were asked to describe the movie in one word, the word is awesome. The movie rocks from the start to the end, mind you there is nothing exceptional about the plot, just like so many other movies, it's basically the struggle between Good and Evil, of course Good prevails in the end, but the best part is how different genres blend in the plot. It has Action, phenomenal FX, Slapstick, and to complete things, there's even a Love Story. Stephen Chow, who happens to be Director, Producer, Writer and the Hero, has done a great job.If you liked the action scenes in Kill Bill / The Matrix, you will definitely like this one (in case you did not like Kill Bill / The Matrix, ignore the reference). While watching the movie, some of the scenes reminded me of both Kill Bill and Matrix (an alternative title for the movie could have well been 'Neo in China'), turns out that it's the same action choreographer 'Yuen Woo-Ping', brilliant choreography, a visual treat.The only thing that I did not enjoy in the India release was the dubbing done by artists who try to talk English with a Chinese accent. I thought it was downright phony and unnecessary, why couldn't they stick to a neutral Indian accent? Anyways apart from that the movie is superb, I'd rate it 10/10, last but not least when you watch the movie, remember it's Reel and not Real, it'll help in absorbing those unbelievable action scenes.

It contains a lot of comedy, and cannot be taken seriously the majority of the time.This movie pokes fun at and pays homage to kung fu movies at the same time, making it a combined power of action and comedy. It features a good, if not somewhat stereo-typical plot about the chosen one who doesn't know about himself, and so on. The movie makes good use of CGI, in a generally comical way, and it shows that you don't have to be a muscle-bound 6'2"" man to be good with Kung Fu. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed similar titles, such as Kung Pow! Enter the Fist or even anime like Naruto.",Kung Fu Hustle

370,pcorkerz,Great over-the-top silliness!,8,21 April 2007,"What a hilarious film! Great over-the-top silliness! It is a parody of the martial arts film genre and so will probably annoy anyone who was expecting something more err... realistic. Most (but not all) of the gruesome stuff is off-screen - watch the cat's shadow. There were, for me in the UK, occasional culture-clash moments of unfunniness but perhaps that is to be expected. The great special effects are mocked along with everything else. Overall, very funny!",Kung Fu Hustle
371,stevezep,Great Film,9,22 April 2005,"For this movie all I saw was a newspaper clipping advertising it. I wanted to see it because of that. I go and to my amazement, this has to be one of the most well put together Kung Fu films I have ever seen. I feel that the Cinematography is brilliant, the story is funny, pleasant, and very well acted, and the fighting is just brilliant. I know that some of it looks fake, some of it isn't possible, but it is the idea there are inhuman powers or gifts that Buddha may have given others. I loved it, I gave it a 9 out of 10. I want to own it, I want to see it again, I try to tell my friends about it (they look at me funny), it is a really good film. If you don't care about the story, go see it for the fight scenes alone. You will begin to feel apart of the story and struggle and the fight scenes will soon just become a pleasant filler while you are trying to find out where the story is going. It even reminded me of Seven Samauri except for the fact that the town was a bit different in this film. They were a bit tougher!! There were even some sad times in the movie. Some characters were knocked off a bit too early. So sad. All in all I highly recommend this film. I think I may have even seen some new shots in the direction. I think this will be Chow's big break. It's sad to say that he was overlooked. I am going to look for his other stuff, I'm hooked!!",Kung Fu Hustle
372,cindia,Great movie by Stephen Chow,10,24 December 2004,"I saw this movie yesterday and it is definitely one of the best movies that was made in the history of Hong Kong. The plot itself is simple, and the storyline is all about kung fu. Yet, it is not just a funny comedy about kung fu. It is more than that. Somehow it is similar to Harry Potter (in this case is wizard) or animations by Hayao Miyazaki in which a world of imagination is created. The characters in the film are so funny and classic. Most of them appeared in some of Stephen Chow's movies before but because the context of every movie is different, the overall result is hilarious. This is a movie that make Hong Kong people proud. I hope it will be a box office success in other countries too. I think I'll definitely buy the movie DVD for my personal collection.",Kung Fu Hustle
373,kellerj0,From Looney Toons to Crouching Tiger: Hustle Hits the Spot,8,1 November 2005,"In his 7th directing effort, Stephen Chow has created a exciting, moving, nostalgic ride that leaves you reeling from beginning to end. One of Chow's primary objectives in this film seems visually stun the audiences. Filled to the brim with exciting action, dramatic violence, sophisticated camera-work, and some of the best sight gags I've seen, Kung Fu Hustle is no doubt a feast for the eyes. So much visual action seems to be possible because at its core this film tells a very simple story. It is deep and emotional, but simple nonetheless. The only part I found visually inadequate were the CGI sight gags. Their comic timing was right on, but the quality wasn't as good as it could be, pulling me out of my engagement with the story.If visual beauty was Chow's primary objective in this film, his secondary certainly seems to be to pay homage to his favorite films. Kung Fu Hustle contains countless references to American culture and films stretching from the 30's and 40's (Top Hat (1934) and Casablanca (1942))all the way up to blockbusters of the past few years (Spider-Man(2004) and Matrix Reloaded (2003)). This is not to mention the Roadrunner legs that Sing and landlady dawn and the assassins' striking resemblance to the Blues Brothers; this film is simultaneously like nothing I've ever seen and a highlight reel of great moments and references to movies I have seen and love. Stephen Chow loves American film and he knows we do too.It should be said here that anyone can create a montage of their favorite movie moments, clump them together, and call it a movie. What Chow does in exemplary fashion is incorporate these moments and reference together into a story keeps us emotionally invested from beginning to end. With plans for a sequel in the works, Chow may well prove to be a master of blending comedy, action, and drama together all while maintaining artistic integrity and keeping the audience nostalgic and loving it.",Kung Fu Hustle
374,maxcm,"A dream of a kid, a dream of people",10,3 May 2005,"A dream of a kid? Remember the bum who sell manuals? If the story about Sing really happens, bum shall be some 20 years older than he first showed up when Sing was a small kid. But at the ending part, he looks the same age with before, trying to sell some ""more powerful"" kung fu manuals. There may be other explanations, but to read this part in a real-life way, it means he is the one who is selling dream manuals, and Sing is just like normal people who just bought one and then,made a dream.Most importantly, the changing age of adult Sing and the Deaf girl back to young kid at the ending part gave a huge hint that they still at their kid age throughout the movie. The Butt boy, Bucktooth Jane, tailor, landlord etc showed in the end also implies that they are not legendary guys in the movie, they are just normal people like u and me. All the stories are a dream done by young Sing. He has evil minds indeed, but he wishes to be a good guy, he wishes greater power will happen to him so that can save at least his girlfriend, and then if possible, save the world. This is a dream not only for him, it is a dream for all movie fans, and also a dream for people in normal life.We go to theatres so we also have dreams. This film is 10 out of 10, because it gives us many implications. One of them is: there are many ways to make a dream. Don't know how? Here is one!",Kung Fu Hustle

I found the 2 films very similar since the creators were the same people. Hustle still gave me plenty of hard laughs. Perhaps, more than that of Shaolin Soccer. I do hope that western people will get to see this film. Although I'm from Asia, I don't understand Chinese. I still enjoyed the film because the jokes are visual. This made me conclude that you'll enjoy it so much as well. I wouldn't be surprised if Stephen Chow gets a Hollywood stint after this film.

The story doesn't even try to be coherent and is nothing more than a device for stringing together contrived set pieces and laboured jokes. The result is ultimately boring. As for levitating combatants, and gangster mobs who politely avoid attacking from behind (preferring to wait until the hero gets round to systematically duffing them up from in front) ... enough already!

The impressive camera techniques and the story sure made this a phenomenal viewing experience.Sorry Jet Li & Jackie Chan - None of the Hollywood movies has ever touched me like this movie did.

It might appear a little stupid if you are new to Stephen Chow's style. But no worries, once you get a hang of his dark humor, you will really enjoy it. After all, he is ranked way up there in Hong Kong entertainment arena along with Jackie Chen and Jet Li as far as popularity and gross income are concerned. I enjoyed this movie a lot more than ""House of Flying Daggers"", which is a little confusing, and characters' motives are unclear. This movie however makes everybody's intentions every clear. It just makes you anxious to find out who is gonna kick whose ass in the end. I also like the love story briefly intertwined with the action scenes. The quick flashback of Stephen Chow's character wins you on his side at early stage of the movie, so that you like his character despite of all the bad things he does. It especially makes you feel good when you see him kicking someone else's ass for a change. In conclusion, I love the movie.

""This one is the funniest,excellent and greatest comedy and gongfu movie that I watched in recent years"", that was what I thought when I walked out of the theater. The movie contains wild imagination, hilarious story, and coolest actions. But those are not all about it, it also brings sweet love, kindness, honest, and justice. I like the music which is quite different from the ""Hero"", and story in this one seems more meaningful and reasonable than the ""hero"" too. It is better than ""kill Bill"" to me. I don't like the bloody scene in the ""kill Bill"", which is neither funny nor cool. But in the ""Kong Fu Hustle"", there are cool actions, not that bloody, but more entertaining. I think Stephen Chow is a talented actor and great director. He really made a great movie this time. I would like to see more of his production.

The action was excellent and fun to watch but it was the comedy that had me laughing out loud like I haven't laughed in a long time. Don't be put off by having to watch this movie with subtitles- once this film gets rolling, you won't notice you're reading them -- and it even somehow enhanced the humor of the film for me. What a treat! The animation of the musical fight scene, the subtle jokes mixed in with the outright guffaws, the playful use and satirizing of stereotypes from all the walks of life is so well done that I'd find it hard to believe anyone could watch this and not walk away almost tired of laughing!",Kung Fu Hustle

This movie is more than a comedy meant to make you laugh. The core of comedy is a tragedy. Most of Chow's early films are more hopeless and tragic, and sometimes I see myself in similar scenes. This one finally gives me some hope in the end.""If you want to learn, I'll teach you"" when Sing says this line to the Beast almost killed him, it's more than forgiving or respecting your competitors or competing to get a winner or what. He don't care who you're, but is willing to help at his most if you meant to be good, like the buddha would guide you. This is BIG LOVE. But what was him before? A nobody that no one would look twice, a loser who wants to be a hero but failed, wants to be a villain but failed too. Like many of us who're struggling to be true to ourselves sometimes, who don't recognize our own charms yet.The sad thing is after CJ7, Chow never made a film this level again. Hope Chow can find his true love soon and enjoy his life, never get bothered by the sh**tty nonsense complains and blames. We love you!

386,knight0748,Comedy at its best,9,31 January 2005,"This movie proves Stephen Chow is no one-hit wonder with Shaolin Soccer. In this movie, he paid tribute to old school HK kung-fu movie with its comical style and music. The movie is well pace and full of funny scenes and characters. The only reason I didn't give it a ten for the rating is due to the fact that they used outdated CG in this film, tho I don't blame them, it's not like they're Hollywood. From what I can see, Stephen Chow is just going to get better since he became director himself. He has done what few comic actors has done, by becoming the story teller and director as well as actor. This movie deserves to be shown in America.",Kung Fu Hustle
387,bec-paulsen,KUNG FU HUSLY REVIEW - may contain spoilers,7,9 May 2013,"Kung Fu Hustle is a 2004 movie directed and starred in by Stephen Chow. This film is an action packed comedy that is set in China in the 1940s, a time where gangs were known for their presence with The Axe Gang known to be the deadliest.The Axe Gang open in the movie with graphic fighting scenes ending in gruesome and painful deaths of civilians. Although the Axe Gang is initially after money it is clear that they will kill one for simply crossing the path with their known symbol, the Axe. The only people whom they don't bother are the poor who simply have nothing to offer, much like the ones of Pig Sty Ally. Stephen Chow plays Sing in the film who is a young man who aspires to be associated with the Axe Gang after being bullied as a child. He and his friend Bone decide to steal the gang's identity and try to demand money from a hair salon in a small village. Surprisingly this small village, also known as Pig Sty Ally is full of people with amazing supernatural Kung Fu powers. Sing tries to fight with the weakest of the villagers but soon catches on that they are one of a kind. He signals for help with the authentic Axe Gang showing up who try to defeat the village and capture Sing and Bone. The Axe Gang are defeated by three members of the village who are discovered to be Kung Fu masters. This starts a huge search for the Axe Gang to find a Master that is strong enough to defeat the villagers for them and the protection of their reputation. Sing and Bone are about to be killed due to their imposturous actions however as axes are thrown Sing drops from his chains and is recognized to be a lock picker. He is given three seconds to pick Bones lock to save his life. Sing is successful and the Axe Gang allow them to keep their lives but send them on a journey to kill someone in order to become a member. The two have many attempts to harm people however in most occurrences Sing gets beaten due to misjudging character with all wounds including knife stabbings suspiciously healing. This becomes a huge journey for the two. Kung Fu Hustle explores the ways and powers of Kung Fu with scenes full of action and gruesome fights; however, there is a lot of comedy incorporated to make the film easier to interpret. The actors are all Chinese but in this version their voices are dubbed over with English which already adds the element of comedy. The tones of the English voices are generally quite high pitched as if one is making a mockery. Comedy is also displayed in the words which have been translated into modern westernized word such as fagot are spoken which is an obvious mockery of the Chinese linguistics of 1940s. The names of characters and places are also very westernized and seen as a mockery such as Pig Sty Ally or Donut, a name of the Baker in Pig Sty Ally. This mockery adds to the comedic element along with the effects of cinematography. Kung Fu its self is exaggerated throughout the film with great cinematography in order to show great effects and exaggerate the power of individuals. These effects highlight instances where one punch can throw people though walls, high up into the sky or simply characters run so fast that you cannot see their legs moving. Although there is a lot of comedy applied throughout the movie the links to Kung Fu and an effective story lines is still obtained. Strong themes of brotherhood such as the way the village groups together in times they are threatened, tradition in the ways of Kung Fu, hierarchy in the ways of Kung Fu masters and to never judge one simply by a glance in many occurrences is represented throughout the film. Mystical elements of traditional and old legends are applied throughout the film. The different strategies represent the different masters and the skills they obtain separate characters to form the hierarchical line of Masters. Once one has met their match, if not killed they must bow to their master an accept defeat. These are the elements of the film of what do not allow a complete mockery of Kung Fu and its relevance to the Chinese Culture. The concluding scenes in the film are full of symbolism with the new life in the symbol of a butterfly that link back to the beginning of the film. The link between the deaf girl Fong, Sing and their childhood is referred back to at the end of the film displaying the long and touching journey of within. This is symbolized with a lolly pop which is shown as great importance to both characters though out the film, even in what we think will be Sings death. This film is very effective in the way comedy, tradition and an effective story line is incorporated. I would recommend this movie especially to an audience who can see past the comedy but into the elements of culture and symbolism within and enjoy a happy ending with suspense for what may become or future predictions.",Kung Fu Hustle
388,JuliaChao,Stephen puts his work into another level!!!,10,26 December 2004,"In general, it's a movie which puts tribute to all the Kung Fu Movie.Some argue that Stephen uses a lots of old jokes and routines in this movie that makes it a little bit weak on the script. However, I think it's one of his best. He doesn't make as many dirty jokes as usual, but you can really learn his philosophy through this two-hours movie and have a very good laugh at the same time. If you really watch the movie carefully, you will know what kung-fu is. Stephen Chow truly understands kung-fu, in my opinion, and it a sure thing that he crazies about it.It's not a common kung-fu movie like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" or ""Hero"". Stephen Chow uses his own way to express kung-fu. I sincerely recommend this movie to those who still has the slightest hesitation whether you should watch this movie or not.Just Go!!!!!!!!!! You won't regret it!!!!",Kung Fu Hustle

But hey, if it ain't broken, why fix it? The acting is superb. The plot is nicely molded. it has a satisfying ending.I haven't laughed so much in months!

392,raveyeh,Stephen Chow's reinvention and revigorization of his own genre,10,31 December 2004,"This is absolutely the best Stephen Chow's movie. Prior to Shaoling Soccer, people were writing him (i.e. his unique style of movie-making) off as a has-been. But Shaolin Soccer proved that he remains current and relevant to cinema.Kungfu Hustle perfects Stephen Chow's unique blend of farcical, action and heartwarming story telling. Perfect use of CGI technology plus plenty of ""real"" Kunfu fighting too.Kungfu Hustle is greater than a mere parody and spoof of martial arts film. Stephen Chow's characteristical ""mo lei tow"" (rough translation: without rhyme or reason)is toned down in this movie but still shines where it matters. (e.g. the dagger throwing scene) The final scene was a illuminating mix of ""mo lei tow"" and Zen like wisdom . i.e. when the villain asked Stephen's character: ""What awesome kungfu was that?"". Stephen flippantly replied, ""You want to learn? I will teach you"".What a intriguing end to this excellent movie! ps: a previous reader was wondering how did Stephen's character acquire such powerful martial arts in the first place, it was mentioned in the film (by the landlady and her husband) that the punches the villain threw at Stephen opened up the latter's ""chi"" and released his innate ""kungfu-ness"". Again, this sort of plot device is not uncommon in classic kungfu shows.",Kung Fu Hustle
393,junjunzh,what a excellent movie!!,10,14 January 2005,"I love this movie very much. Not just because I have been a fans of Chow for about 15 years, not just because of the great Kung Fu moves in the movie, but the most important thing is that I am moved by the changes of Chow,used to be a famous comedy actor,now have become a true director, and let the movie to tell his dream and show respect to the greatest martial artist -- Bruce Lee.Well,this movie is also very funny, like the chasing between Chow and the Fat lady, like the scene that they throw the knives....etc Besides,the dancing at the beginning is also interesting, and the funny Crocodile Gang..I wish you call love this movie :)",Kung Fu Hustle
394,hueman74,This one stands out,9,3 January 2005,"I'm not a great fan of Stephen Chow's but I must say this one really made me change my mind.Well, one can say Kung Fu (KF) is slapstick, or owe too much to CGI and special effects. What really captivated me were the characters in the movie. Most of them are outright weird but they are so uniquely comical and memorable in their own ways. From the shabby dwellers to the blind killers to the sloppy fight master.The fight sequence easily rivals that of the matrix and Yuen Woo-Ping did it again! I'm totally immersed in this surreal imaginary world for the entire 90min. Worth every penny of the tickets but I did leave the cinema with a serious cough (for laughing too hard too much).",Kung Fu Hustle
395,vincemeagei,something about sign language you don't know,10,20 January 2005,"Given the choice between Shaolin Soccer or Kung Fu which one i prefer?I think i will choose Kung Fu.Not only its CGI is 5 times better than Shaolin Soccer,but also it affects my feelings about Chow's past movies . Although it is said that he plays a role who appears half of the time,i think it doesn't diminish the importance of his role. Because why did he change his mind to hit the top world's killer(Fire-clouded devil)with a stick,and why did he stop fighting to that crazy guy until he played Buddha palm .The key is that Sing is not really bad ,and Sing in the play always said ""i am not a good man,i want to blah..blah..""but if someone were a bad guy ,how can he or she say ""i want to kill a person,and i wanna be a bad person!"" Because bad guys kill people without reasons instead of hesitating about that! So he can hit TOP world's killer right now.However,Sing was struggling with right and wrong as if he was on the edge of darkness,and stood on the steel bar where he waited for someone give him a push. Who did push him at this moment? Yes! What you think is that girl.She told him with sign language. ""Hey! Did you forget?You saved me in the past!"" But,Stephen Chow told the reporter that mute girl's lines should be "" Hey! Did you forget?you are a good person!why you robbed me ? Thus,Sing were facing the dilemma of being a good person or a bad guy. Finally,Sing said to himself and realised that he is a good man! This is why he was for the landlady and landlord.Likewise,after he got hurt badly,the landlady asked him ""how come you became righteous?Have you got something to say?"" Then,Sing drew a stick of candy with his blood. In fact,it shows that he is a good man within,and is ready to do what he has to do and what he is prepared to do.It is similar to following his instincts like 6 guys in Shaolin Soccer who had found their roles after they got punched in the match. To sum up,every time i see Kung Fu ,i have a different feeling. It is worthwhile to pay money to see it again and again! Stephen Chow not only earns our money,but also makes everyone laugh and cry!",Kung Fu Hustle

This movie can also make you laugh.Another important thing should be mentioned is that the action director is Woo-ping Yuen, who had directed in Matrix!The visual effects of this movie is excellent,too. i guess you'll never imagine how cool kung fu is before you watch the movie. Of course fighting with each others may involve some moderate violence. If you think it's OK, take your children to the theater with you and you will have a good show.",Kung Fu Hustle
397,maloce254,A nice Chinese slapstick comedy from Stephen Chow,8,14 March 2005,"This is a slapstick, true to the word. If you've watched Stephen Chow's Shaolin Soccer, you'll feel right at home with this flick. I was able to recognize a few people from Shaolin Soccer in this movie; including sing's sidekick who plays the overweight brother in SS. There is action in this movie, but don't come in here expecting a real action movie, even if the action director here is the action director of the Matrix(so I've heard), in reality, even the fights were goofy(save for a few, people do get killed in this one). Overall with its great cast of over the top wacky characters, a so-so story line, and some clever gags, this movie has something for everyone.",Kung Fu Hustle
398,classikz,Kung Fu Hustle is another great action/comedy by Stephan Chow,9,16 January 2005,"It seems to me that Stephan chows movies are getting better and better. Kung Fu Hustle is better than Shaolin Soccer in my opinion due to the fact that i'm not much of a soccer fan but Shaolin Soccer had a good story to it. Story-wise, Kung Fu is the typical Chow movie, but in a good way. The CGI was very good at times i couldn't tell the difference between real and fake.After the movie i was left craving for more of the action scenes from the movie because they looked so damn good, especially the first fight. I might have given it ten stars if it weren't for the fact that the story seemed to have been rushed. A little longer, more action scenes, definitely more chow jokes, and this movie should be more of a hit than it already is.",Kung Fu Hustle
399,andres-arjona,Good but not great,5,5 February 2005,"The movie itself presents very good quality in terms of costumes, special effects and scenarios. It is very nice how China and people living styles is presented. Unfortunately even though it is indeed a fun movie, the story gets too monotonous after perhaps the first 40 minutes. But, the first 40 minutes are pretty good and specially some fighting scenes with the 3 kung fu masters. Unfortunately I cant say I enjoyed the rest of the movie in the same way. If you don't mind about the quality of the story or watching the same thing for about an hour with you should definitively give it a try. If not its better to watch something else. I would never watch this movie again.",Kung Fu Hustle

Oh I occasionally laughed but that was generally in sheer shock at how I let my friends drag me to see it. The plot made no sense, nuns are funnier and bluntly it was just stupid. I would like someone to really explain to me why they liked it, I cannot be persuaded I assure you but it would be interesting to hear their reasons. Personally I would advise anyone who has been unfortunate to buy the DVD to burn it immediately and bury the ashes so future generations will never have the misfortune to witness it.",Kung Fu Hustle

I'm sorry to say, I don't think Stephen Chow's movies should be meant for an American audience. There are a lot of Chinese references that Americans won't understand, and they won't be able to appreciate the ingenuity of the plot as much.Nonetheless, I thought the parodies were hilarious, and the martial arts again is superb. This movie should not be advertised as a sequel to Shaolin Soccer because it really has no relation to it. It is an enjoyable movie by itself.",Kung Fu Hustle
404,baboos,Fantastic,9,18 October 2005,"This is one of the most richly imaginative, creative, downright enjoyable movies I've ever seen. I haven't enjoyed myself this much since Pulp Fiction.It took me a while to figure out who the hero was. First I thought it was the barber guy who got himself constantly smacked about by the landlady. I suppose it's because he looked so dim, he therefore had to be a kung fu master in disguise. I've read some of the other posts, and everyone seems to think the knife scene was the funniest. I didn't expect to come to this movie for a laugh, but the knife scene almost killed me. Luckily it was just me and my friend in the movie theatre, so I could let it all out.If you go to the movies to free your imagination, then this is the movie for you. Stay away from people who say it's far-fetched and unrealistic. If they want realism, they should go to the laundromat.",Kung Fu Hustle

They are unlike anything I have ever seen. I would recommend them to anybody who is into Asian Comedy/Action movies. I hope to see more of Stephen. I enjoy to watch a movie and have my ribs hurt from laughing, then to be wow'd by the excellent Martial Arts and Special Effects. Again I am dazzled by the way that Stephen finds ways to pull the audience in the movie and as well lighten the mood by instantly forcing you to break out in laughter even at a point where you have become totally enthralled. So I end with this, Stephen, if you ever come across this comment, coudos! Keep up the good work.",Kung Fu Hustle
406,sawyerf,a little help for understanding kung fu hustle,10,13 April 2005,"I'm Chinese, I'm sure that there will be a lot of fun your Americans cann't understand because of the culture background. like the landlord couples claimed their name as ""little dragon girl""(which was translated as ""Helen"" that means nothing but a girls' name) and ""yang guo"". these two names, a couple too, are extraordinary well known by all Chinese people---I mean you can not find a single person in china who don't know these two names, who they are and what they have done. they are the hero and heroine in a extraordinarily famous martial art novel. their love affair, their heroic deed and the unhuman beauty of ""little dragon girl"" take the highest position in every people's heart. At the end of that story the couple who were almost god and goddess disappeared an no one know where they've gone.

I cannot praise this movie enough.No Spoilers from me, but the Full House was Enthralled, Laughing and had a Fantastic Time !!!The Story-telling was Wonderful, the CGI was not too Obnoxious, there were just enough Fight Scenes, and the Soundtrack was Perfect. Every Chow-crony was Tailor-made for his/her role, and what a Treat to see the Old-School Kung Fu Stars !!!Stephen Chow's 3+ years of work on this Film totally paid off.GO GO GO to see this Hilarious, Exciting, Touching Action MASTERPIECE !!!",Kung Fu Hustle

I used to think only Chinese can understand Chow's humor,wow~~~!At least, it is not a bad thing.This movie uses too many computer techniques to make up the lack of action and story. Chow has passed though his golden period, about previous decade, and those movies affect us greatly. I think the best of his movie is ""King of Comedy"".This movie is not the hero dream but the story of a simple man who wants to be a great actor. It's just like Chow's true experience. I think you can get more pure fun from it but maybe tears with laugh.",Kung Fu Hustle
409,ionbadescu,The greatest fighting comedy ever!!!!,9,8 April 2005,"Great. I didn't imagine a kung fu movie can make me laugh so so hard. It is a nice story, kind of simple and soft but the situations and characters are beautifully constructed. It is a movie for everyone who wants to laugh and remain with a big smile after.The set is colorful and the story easy to follow through. It looks a little cheap at first but from the start it will keep you in your spot and you won't realize that your out of popcorn.My advice is to try and see it with subtitles 'cause their voices and the language just fits perfectly and give a very funny nature to the characters. Small dosage of metaphorical movie making and great ending make this one a great pill for those who wanna leave the theater with a little extra something. You know... like that kid in front of you while getting out of the cinema... he says something like: ""And did you see... I wanna be able to do that!""Clearly Hong Kong production manages to put its money on the right people. They mastered the effects and they give a new look to fighting scenes. It is Dragon Ball style. No spoilers! I swear!I remember getting out from ""Matrix"" and it was the same if not a little bit more moved by the novelty of what it brings to me.Go see it, buy it when it gets out on DVD and enjoy it 'cause it is a land mark for fighting genre and Asian comedy.",Kung Fu Hustle
410,thompson-p,Thats Chow to do it,10,8 April 2005,"It's time Hollywood and the public stand up and realise what a genius Stephen Chow really is.A vibrant comedy with beautiful colours and cinematography. I loved every second of it. The action is out of this world, very similar to the final fantasy games with special moves and what not. But the movies winner is the movies charm and endearing characters, each one has there own individual flaws.And dare I say it ""better than Shaolin Soccer"", which I never thought was possible.If we had more talents like Stephen Chow in the Western world, I probably wouldn't have to sit through churn like Boogeyman and Be Cool.Sought yourselves out Hollywood, you have a lot of catching up to do.",Kung Fu Hustle

I'm not one for Kung Fu movies so I was a bit pessimistic about going to see it. I am so glad I did. It is an hilarious comedy and will have you laughing from the opening scene right up until the credits roll. It has a bit of a Matrix style story line with their search for ""the one"", but there's nothing serious about it, it's just constant amusement. The special effects are a bit far fetched and exaggerated, but i think that only adds to the fun of the movie. I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see what was going to happen next. If you're worried about wasting your money, don't, because you would be crazy to miss this...I'm recommending it to everyone - young, old, male, or female, it really doesn't matter - You'll Love It!!

412,Ajith-Thampi,An excellent mix of everything you ever wanted!,9,11 April 2005,"For the first time, somebody has ever been able to bring comedy from a cartoon into real film. Astounding! For the first time, somebody has ever been able to be provide a fantasy with Kung Fu in it. Fantastic! and for the first time, I was sitting and laughing and imagining and appreciating a movie that has every little flavour of cinema in it!Awesome Movie with Fantasy and Comedy and Action and somehow its a Musical too. Stephen Chow is a remarkable Director and he has made a movie that can be watched again and again. ...i am still suffering from the pain infringed upon me laughing my head off....damn.!!! The Actors, from Crocodile Gang Boss to The Beast had some really interesting characterisation, something different. Stephen Chow, that guy really does have a good comic timing, a good taste for decent comedy and he sure knows how to make a person laugh and not kill him in the process. The Action scenes, again, too good. The Kung Fu displayed just keeps you hooked. You just watch and say, wish i were like them (very emotional moment for me). I could see CGI in the action, and it was a work well done. the CGI was astonishing and the smoothness of each frame... a taste to any creative's heart. The Romance, hmm, was this missing somehow? Na, there was Romance too...but of all there is this cute mute girl who i wish where my girl friend. If anyone know her please tell her that i ""love"" her. The Comedy, you have to watch it. Sheesh, Stephen Chow really does know how to get into a guy's heart. The Comics of the movie somehow reminded me of Tom and Jerry, Bugs Bunny and Pink Panther. He has just brought an animated cartoon into a real moving picture..wow..how did he do that? There is not a moment you can stop laughing except when the movie gets over...its crying time.Then Sentiments, damn...this has that too? Yup, somehow it was there, but not very touching, i generally laughed over it too. Oops!Then,hmm...is that it? i guess so! But truly a worth film, and if anyone says ""what just happened here"" kinda thing...break his bones, he doesn't deserve to see good cinema. Stephen Chow, Well Done. You're the Master. Bring more movies like this....Please!",Kung Fu Hustle

If you enjoyed Shaolin Soccer or any of the other movies chow has put out I would really recommend this flick.While the film definitely had more in the way of special effects than Shaolin or any of his other films for that matter, I do not feel that it detracted from the film at all, in actuality I feel it greatly added to my enjoyment of the film. There was a scene with some musical Kung Fu masters that was simply amazing and I will leave it at that so as to not ruin for those that have not seen it.As with his other comedies the action was quick and light hearted. It contained the same cast we have come to know and love in Chow films and thats a good thing, as they make the movie for me as much as he does.to sum it up if you are looking for a good light hearted and quick action/comedy and you don't mind a couple of bad translations then this is definitely the movie for you.",Kung Fu Hustle

In a word, fighting is the important scenario!Thismovie does not reflect the real life of Shanghai. At the end, almost my classmate hate it! This movie cheats us,it looks like a awful cartoon movie with computer skills. Actually, Stephen Chow is a local comedy actor. However, he can not direct a good movie by his heart.

I can well and truly say it exceeded all expectations that I had. I'm not a great fan of kung-fu movies and often find the fighting and other nonsense that goes on unrealistic and uninspiring. Kung-Fu Hustle takes a firing shot at the stereotype, combining both amusing and gripping fight sequences. Accompanying the kung-fu in this film, is a well-written storyline featuring a re-emergence of a previous love, a fellowship of fighters and a musical-style routine from a group of Japanese dancers. Steven Chow manages to pair both comedy and action to form the most enjoyable film I've watched of the year so far.

There are enough plot twists and interesting characters to make this movie satisfying to watch. I don't want to give too much away, but the kung fu masters in this movie aren't the typical ones, which is very funny.

While the plot was fairly simple and it was definitely an action film, there were just so many things that surprised me throughout the movie. There were times in the film where I had to applaud - it was such a ""feel good"" movie and I left the theater with the same HUGE smile on my face that was on my face for about 90% of the movie.If you haven't seen this film yet, don't read anything else about it - just GO so you can experience it for yourself without anybody's opinions coloring your judgment.

And it's totally different humor then you are used to. (So don't think it Jakie Chan movies humor, this humor is more special :D )It also has very good special effects, from time to time it will remind you of warner bros, if people run very fast, it'll go like roadrunner etc. Really great to see, this also because of the fantastic special effects.It also has great fighting (as you probably could tell from the title ;) ). Here the special effects look fantastic again. The fighting also has some weird stuff in it, some freaky fighting styles etc. Sometimes it has some matrix stuff in it, not really the bullet time, although it slow downs regularly, but it's kinda different, but more cause of the fast fighting, awesome moves etc.So, if you like fighting movies, and want to laugh a whole bunch of time, just go and see this movie, the chance that you won't like it is very very little.",Kung Fu Hustle

It's creativity, it's playfulness, it's execution - it's combination of kung fu, well worn tropes made new, and comedy stand alone.

Not it only contains martial arts, but comedy. Yet the movie, strikes a balance between this comedy and seriousness of the movie. And this was this balance of extremeites, which made it more enjoyable for me. Too much comedy, would reuin the dark story of the movie, while too much seriousness would destroy the point of watching this satire. 
Overall the movie is nice, would give it a 8/10. Being a statrical film, this movie aims to critize the actions of the axe gang. However, at the start of the film it exemplifies the Axe gang's brutality, as they killed a rival gang of mobsters. But at the introduction of our main protagonists, and the arrival of the martial artists. Come to mock the idea of the axe gang are untouchable. With the martial artists, to distrupt thier deeds, they now turn to bounty hunters and Mr Beast to silence these challengers.

Overall, this was my top movie of 2004/2005.Unfortunately, the same does not ring true of the recent DVD release. Rife with anticipation, I bought the DVD the day it was released. Sadly enough, it has apparently been re-edited into an inferior version. Several shots were altered or removed completely, and the subtitles were changed into less funny dialogue. It's amazing what a few ""tweaks"" can do to ruin a great film.If you can find a copy of the theatrical release, I highly recommend it, but if all you can find is the DVD release, don't bother.

In the same night I also rented ""The Farewell,"" a German film about the last days of Bertolt Brecht. That's more my typical fare: the quiet European character study of a great artist and the women who love him. I twiddled my thumbs through it after having seen Chow's mind-bending visual insights. Aside from the sincerity of the story--its good guy thinks he's a bad guy but becomes the best guy/hero theme--""Hustle"" is a non-stop feast of turned tables, of the literal and figurative varieties.

431,markwestall99,Unbelievably poor,1,29 September 2005,I can understand why people find slap stick comedy and the like amusing but where exactly does Kung Fu Hustle come in this world of categorisation that we are living in. For me - 'the unwatchable' seems suitable.It is a struggle at times to tell when the director has decided to take the film seriously or when he is attempting to put across his warped perception of comedy. There has been a wave of popularity toward film from Asia and films such as Flying Daggers are deserving of such attention; this however appears to be an attempt to grab viewers while foreign cinema is thriving because I for one can't see any other reason why one would pay good money to see .Dreadful.,Kung Fu Hustle

I was less than enthusiastic when I tossed it into the drive of my Athlon, but a promise is a promise, after all. Five minutes later, a nuclear strike warning in my town couldn't have torn me away from the screen, and it's been watched a dozen times since.There's always been a certain cheesiness to Hong Kong cinema, but on rare occasions a writer or director will directly tap a nerve and somehow weave that directly into the story: 'Kung Fu Hustle' is one of those films. This piece isn't simply a 'standard' kung fu movie; it's a romance, a sweeping portrait of good-versus-evil, and a moral lesson on the use of power. The comedic bits are so well integrated into the story that it flows smoothly from one tone to another. The fight choreography is stellar, and special care was taken to make sure that every character in the piece is human. There're no 'perfect' people or places, and it somehow makes the wire fighting that appears in parts seem believable. The acting is excellent and the camera work is all rock steady.Feeling jaded? Burdened? Wonder if it's possible for one person to make a difference? Settle in with a copy of this film, and believe...",Kung Fu Hustle

434,dominator63,Hilarious- best spoof of martial arts movies ever,10,9 November 2005,"Slow to start because of build-up & background, this quickly moves from gory gangster flick & becomes the true comedy it really is. The characters are often a little typed to standard, but this is a spoof so that is to be expected & actually part of the mockery of the gangsters & martial arts fighters at which it is poking fun. The gags are never tiresome; some are hard to catch unless you are paying attention (especially one where a character says something in English & the subtitle is in Chinese). I was sorry that it got the limited play in my area (St Louis MO) & that it got an R rating. I would let 13 yr old children watch this. Should have been PG-13. The minute this one hit the stores, I went out and got a copy. If you like to laugh, this one won't disappoint.",Kung Fu Hustle
435,lricucci,Hilarious & Brilliant,10,26 November 2005,"This movie was the 2º movie to ever made laugh and later laugh more. first with its parodies and moments of rip offs from other movies which made laugh almost uncontrollable. the effects in the movie are riveting with the hyperbole and endless amount of an obvious sense of irony. its something artistically wonderful and very funny.its storyline is very good one with allot of elements of the ""prequel"" and also allot of details of sing's life when a kid.The fat sidekick with problems of sweat and his companion on his endless quest of entering the Axe gang that sees him as scum.The super powers of the people in this movie are like bugs bunny with Jackie Chan with special effects.but in the bottom line its a very very good movie",Kung Fu Hustle
436,andybandyman,a Kung Fu war between two gangs,10,17 December 2005,"Kung Fu Hustle was really funny and entertaining. It was really exaggerated, but not in a corny way. I would definitely recommend it. it's a good movie to watch with friends. it's like napoleon dynamite with more plot and energy in Chinese. it's not only fighting, but romance and comedy. I only saw one scene (the scene with the harpists) and i had to see it, i knew it would be good. The violence isn't gruesome either so it's a fun movie to watch. It's not very predictable either. If you liked kill bill (1 or 2) then you should definitely see Kung Fu Hustle. I can't wait for the second one to come out. It should be in theaters in spring 2006. It's called Kung Fu Hustle 2",Kung Fu Hustle
437,tomiwijaya,just see the movie and have a blast,7,12 January 2006,"My brother in law rented this movie and I never really a big fan of Stephen Chow but nonetheless I knew his movies are funny (or expect to be funny). So I watched it and it turned out to be a funny movie. Forget about the lack of whatever, just enjoy the movie and all minuses will be forgotten. Because we are not critics and we go to the movies to be entertained, and that's what this movie does. It's entertaining and that's what matters. It's not about a movie with top notch special fx, or a movie with gorgeous girls and handsome guys. But it's about Stephen Chow's effort to combine martial arts with a bit of laughter and he succeeded. At the end of the movie you'd know you already spent your money wisely cause it made you laugh. There's another movie of his that is also very funny. It's about him looking for the 9th wife and hoping she's not a gambler like all his 8 wives. Can't remember the title but it's extremely funny from the beginning to the end. Hope you guys can find it.",Kung Fu Hustle

Hardly knows where it is going
Shift of characters, hard to connect
Still funny, confusing
Superpower, cgi, cartoonI, despite being a lover of films with strong messages and deep/ disturbing themes, still enjoyed having to watch Kung Fu Hustle. I know this because even if this happened to be the fourth time I have watched it, I still found myself laughing and enjoying its many comedic elements and shallow jokes. Though the movie in itself is quite simple, such that it did not choose to delve into deeper themes and symbolisms, but made use of ""slapstick comedy"" as well as the idiocy of the characters as a means to tell a story that captivates the audience's attention. Through a constant flow of comic relief, not much thinking and analysis is needed by the audience to understand and appreciate the movie, thus even the most shallow movie-goers could be won over by the charm and the appeal of this film. At the same time, if one were to observe how the director chose to present the film, he or she did not go for the approach of being realistic, but mainly used their strength of going all out to make the film fiction. This is highly evident in how CGI was used to overexaggerate blows, facial expressions/ features, deaths, fightscenes and transitions. They even gave characters superpowers to make normal traditional chinese kungfu action scenes more appealing to western audience. With all these together, it does not only create the definition of comedy in both aspects of VFX, SFX and their characters, but the overall lighthearted atmosphere it gives off (even in dramatic scenes) is extremely entertaining, altogether earning around 6-7 stars in my opinion.But it is also this innocent vibe which hides a greater satire to what the entire movie actually chooses to mock. Upon observing the film, one could notice that the film hardly knew where it was going. Even to myself, I felt the abrupt shift of characters and scenes far too confusing to be fully invested into the storyline. In one segment, we see the Axe Gang terrorizing the locals, in another, the conflict between the residents of Pig Sty, and later on, randomly, the main character shows up with a backstory and thus commences a standard hero's journey plotline. The flow of the movie could have been more organized, but from this observation, I learned to see how this film chose to use satire and its jumbled up plotline to mimic and criticize the the nature of Western Media/ Films. Having to start with the Main Character, he deviates from the standard story of a Asian Hero's film from other movies by stripping his or her motivation of doing justice based on the commonly darker themes (ex. revenge, honor, etc.) found in many Eastern literature or films. Instead, we see the common Western ideals of being strongest in the hierarchy of power, shown by the competition amongst Kung Fu masters to be the best in the martial arts, The Beast (Leung Siu-lung) bowing to Sing, Sing wanting to feel powerful or self-confident by joining the axe gang (due to a traumatic experience of being overpowered by bullies), etc. This Western idea of power is repeated all throughout a film, and there is a rivalry between the characters to be on top. At the same time, there are also many factors that were added in the film to further appeal to the taste of Western audiences. These include such usages of CGI, which was not common in Chinese films produced in the years around when Kung Fu Hustle was made, there were the use of superpowers and superhuman abilities that brought taste to the overly used hand-to-hand combat which the Chinese have been so used in incorporating in their action films (and may look quite bland in the eyes of the West). Lastly, the director tried to fit as much stories and events possible in the span of the 1 hour and 40 minute film. Because it took at movie quite a long time before the main character was introduced, it was evident of how rushed the character development of Sing was. All at once we get the memory of how Sing tried to defend Fong, before one knows it, he gets beaten to a pulp, gains a mentor (Landlady and Landlord), becomes the supreme master of Kung Fu, and returns back to a normal life pursuing a humble goal of love. Altogether, this shows a clear resemblance to the hero's journey, a patterned plotline that is commonly used in movies such as those created by Marvel, DC, and western action movies; all of which are generally accepted by the public. 
I believe that this way of presenting the movie, in a comedic, crammed and shallow fashion was all intentional in having to criticize Western films today. The director made use of many tropes, cliché events and comedic elements that are taken from Western genres to further enhance the appeal of this Asian/ Chinese film even to foreigners. It gave taste to ordinary chinese films, but also was satirical in order to exaggerate the Western qualities it shared. This was even done to the other works of Stephen Chow such as Shaolin Soccer or Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons. This strategy, at the end was successful, as it not only opened the minds for people to give more attention to the films created by the East, but also helped him garner around 7-8 stars to many of his works.",Kung Fu Hustle
440,Lupab,"Chow succeeded much in Kungfu, but lost some in comedy",8,9 May 2006,"As a film worker in Hongkong, it is not surprising at all that, one day, Chow summoned up spirit to make a Kungfu movie. Not to mention Chow is a big fan of Bruce Lee and Kungfu movies. He has been dreaming about fancy combat scenes since he was a kid. When he eventually gained enough power in this industry, he set out to produce a Kungfu movie to visualize all his imaginary fight sequences long haunting in his mind.To do this, Chow needed real Kungfu experts. He fulfilled a long time wish of finding a martial monk, Yu Xing, from Shaolinsi Temple, who played Coolie and delivered the top kicks in the movie. He wanted a master of cudgel. Sammo Hung recommended Zhi Hua Dong who had been practising Beijing Opera since 10 years old and majored in martial art at college. Dong's presence of Donut in this movie secured the most exquisite fights. Chi Ling Chiu (Tailor) is disciple's disciple of Wong Fei Hung, a master of Hong Fist. These three masters delivered the most breath-taking scenes. Indeed, the first fighting sequence in the movie tops, simply because what they played is solid Kungfu. Check out the sober and elegant stances by Donut and the swift and fierce kicks by Coolie! I like the second fight against the musicians too, especially when Coolie is killed. The leaves are cut off, the basin is beat over, the cat is sliced up ... these help to visualize the precise ambiance and illustration as Chi is applied through music to attacking. There is not much about real kungfu, but Chow made a brilliant job to put on screen what kungfu fans had only been able to imagine about scenes like masters fighting against each other using music, or howl. The cudgel performance from virtuosi Dong climaxes the act and matches perfectly the atmosphere elaborated by CGI and music. But I don't like the idea of hordes of skeletons delivered by the musician. It should be like invisible but powerful Chi flow through music which can punch on and cut into objects in distance. The lion's roar is also well executed in the fight against the musicians. I particularly like that rain drops were suspended by the Chi flow surging in air. This kind of details show how fresh and vivid Chow's imagination is.Chow also invited Siu-Lung Leung to play the bad guy. Chow was a big fan of Leung, who once was the most successful substitute for Bruce Lee. But Leung didn't get much chance in this movie to show off his kicks, as Chow relied heavily on CGI in Leung's fighting sequences. It's a dilemma, how can you depict a master who is supposed to be much superior to the real masters as Dong, Xing and Chiu? Chow's answer is to using CGI to make the Beast's moves quick. The result is that all the moves turned out to be simple sway and punch. It is animation, not kungfu, though some may say the effect is not bad. As a Kungfu movie, KFH is a compellent try, but Chow's fans are never satisfied if he does not provide a comedy with a quality as 'From Beijing with love', or an epic as 'The Chinese Odyssey'. In many fans' opinion, KFH lacks for many things here. After all, it's not an easy task to make a comedy to exceed the works during his hay day. A typical Chow's movie is usually an extremely self-indulgent one, wholly relying on slapstick and nothing else. But he wanted more this time. He offered other actors much time because he is wise to know that he need kungfu experts to fight in the movie, not himself. He decided to put kungfu, acting and settings in the first place and constrain his gushing waggery a bit. The jokes are not original and fierce as usual, if you have watched half of Chow's movies, though they are still effective at some points as they are well executed.The great pity is that he left Man Tat Wu out of this movie. After being amused by the highly successful pair in most of Chow's movies, we end up with a movie, which Chow put in all his physical energy and intelligence, without Man Tat Wu. There are rumours that they have split up because of Chow's demanding attitude in work. The loss is obvious, for Chi Chung Lam as the fat sidekick is incompetent at this position which Wu used to be at. His dull facial expression and pale voice make his part totally insipid. There is no chemistry at all between Lam and Chow.The surprising contribution is from Kwok-Kwan Chan who was as incompetent as Lam in Shaolin Soccer. But he did the job with skill and ease here. It's like his Chi flow was channelled and he became the One all of sudden. His role as the cruel and arrogant gang boss is a brilliant try. He prevented it from being a conventional bad buy by playing his voice and body language in an exaggerated way. It was very effective, for he must be a natural born dance genius. But I still confused how he could play his voice so well here, while he struggled a lot and made more than 20 NGs for the first lines in Shaolin Soccer.I have to applaud the Art Department's work. The image of the apartment complex may be based on Chow's early life and previous movies like QiShiEr Jia FangKe. It is the most interesting place in the movie providing a wonderful stage to weave intriguing stories and hold interesting characters. The idea that some kungfu masters live anonymously in a slum is engaging itself, for it is a fancy wish for kungfu fans that some masters are actually living amongst the public, not in far mountains and remote temples.",Kung Fu Hustle
441,nobleelbon,"cool action .., with fine blend of comedy",8,10 March 2006,"Absolutely cool movie with action filled comedy blended fight scenes .The stunt choreography is done to a level next to complete perfection . The movie however has some impact from Matrix sequel of movies with the gangsters cladding themselves in Black suite but reenacts all the superb action of a Chinese shaolin movie that has its imperious stand over all other action movies.The story outline is quite simple where the hero tries to redefine his Kung fu image which he thinks he acquired in his child hood but failing to do so, tries to join the evil force, but in the end joins hands with the good force and fight the evil.The movie however fails in the scene - the turning point - to clearly throw light that stirs the hero to realize and defer from evil men to help the good .",Kung Fu Hustle
442,bigsam0069,Worst film ever,1,6 April 2006,"OK so we've all heard the positive comments and votes here on IMDb about this film, now I am going to contradict them with my review of Kung Fu Hustle. Firstly, the dubbing is terrible. I don't speak Chinese so I watched it in English. Words are said ages after lip movement and scene directions. Some reviews have praised this as part of the humour, I find it annoying and poor direction in the making of the film. Secondly, while I have mentioned humour lets discuss it.....well thats it, there is none. Maybe its something that is lost on me but an old woman running around with her legs moving as fast as Roadrunner in the Warner Brothers cartoons just doesn't strike me as amusing. Thirdly, the special effects are dreadful. How many more Oriental films do we have to watch with actors flying around on wires? It was overused in Crouching Tiger, then again in House of flying daggers, this film uses the same tricks of the trade but does it more and more which makes it lose any credibility it had left. Lastly, the script is unbelievably bad. Besides the lack of humour, the action does nothing to make the film entertaining. Be it from ghost samurai warriors flying out of a gigantic violin type weapons, to the old Roadrunner lady retaliating with one of her own from her constantly cigarette filled mouth. The indestructible 'bad guy' that acts like a toad, to the hero flying around with a hand of fire ready to burn that toad, the film lacks any logic or sense throughout. No need to elaborate any further, the film stinks and it strikes me as bewildering that it is rated so highly",Kung Fu Hustle
