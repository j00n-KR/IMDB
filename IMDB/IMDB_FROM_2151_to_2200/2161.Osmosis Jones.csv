0,TheLittleSongbird,"Clever, original and entertaining",8,8 June 2010,"Osmosis Jones isn't the funniest movie I have ever seen, but it is very clever and has an original concept. The humour is crude I agree, but it is actually amusing- the script does have its witty and amusing parts. The animation is not too bad either, certainly a unique style of animation, the backgrounds are nice and the characters have interesting features. And the music is very good as well. As I've said already, the concept is very original and the equally original and well written story(even with one or two predictable parts) does justice to that concept. Also, I liked the characters, Ozzy and Drix are likable and what they get up to is intriguing, fun and often unpredictable, Thrax is a great villain and the voice acting from Chris Rock, Laurence Fishburne, David Hyde Pierce, William Shatner and Bill Murray is top notch. Overall, clever, original and entertaining. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Osmosis Jones
1,SnoopyStyle,"animation good, but live action gross and boring",6,28 September 2013,"The Farrelly brothers are dipping into the animation pool. It's colorful and primitive animation. It's pretty good, but that's not really the problem. Surprisingly the problem is Bill Murray and live action stuff.Frank Detomello is a slob. He eats a hard boiled egg covered with a deadly germ. And we travel inside Frank to see white blood cell policeman Osmosis Jones (Chris Rock) battle evil virus Thrax (Laurence Fishburne) with the help of Drix (David Hyde Pierce).Bill Murray looks awful as he gets sicker and sicker. I have to ask if we're supposed to laugh at Bill? It's just gross. Not the gross out humor that the Farrellys are known for. It isn't funny at all.The animated sections are much better. In fact I prefer they cut out the live action stuff. Chris Rock does a good voice. He has good chemistry with David Hyde Pierce's Drix. They need a few more jokes, but I like the City of Frank.",Osmosis Jones
2,claudio_carvalho,A Great Class of Hygienic and Human Body Functions,9,27 November 2003,"Frank (Bill Murray) is a widow without hygienic and bad alimentary habits. He eats food that felt on the floor without cleaning, he does not wash his hands before eating and he eats only junk food. His daughter keeps unsuccessfully trying to correct his behavior. One day, Frank eats a dirty egg and gets a disease. From this moment on, the human body functions are showed through very funny and educational cartoons. The hero, Osmosis Jones, is a white globule, with Chris Rock's voice. The great Farrely brothers again surprise me. This funny (and sometimes scatological movie) is a great class of hygienic and human body functions. Chris Rock and Laurence Fishburne give a great performance with their voices. Bill Murry has the role of a disgusting character. An excellent and very educational movie, indicated also (or specially) for children. My vote is nine.",Osmosis Jones
3,lee_eisenberg,"quite a ""body"" of work",7,3 May 2006,"This could only come from the Farrelly brothers! When zoo-keeper Frank Detomello (Bill Murray) accidentally swallows a germ named Thrax (Laurence Fishburne) that starts causing trouble in the city that is Frank's body, cop Osmosis Jones (Chris Rock) sets about trying to find the trouble.Of course, since this is from the guys who gave us ""Dumb & Dumber"" and ""There's Something About Mary"", you know that the plot is an excuse for a series of gross occurrences. And there certainly are some here (just think of what all one can do with the human body). It's hard to say what's my favorite scene. All that I can tell you is that this is not a movie for the fainthearted. Pretty cool. Also starring Chris Elliott, Molly Shannon, and the voices of David Hyde Pierce, Brandy, William Shatner, Ron Howard and Kid Rock.",Osmosis Jones
4,Quinoa1984,"Clever, with numerous sight gags",6,15 August 2001,"Osmosis Jones is a comedy of human proportions, I guess.  It works enough and when it works well it's a good movie.  Although when you think about it the plot-line inside Frank's body (frank is played by Bill Murray with no shame in great form) is rather routine and for me was the only thing keeping this from being really good.Still, it might be a worthwhile movie, more for kids than adults, but it it watchable for all.  Various voices include Chris Rock, Brandy Norwood, Laurence Fishburne, David Hyde Pierce and William Shatner.  Pleasant most of the way and sometimes cool.  B",Osmosis Jones
5,view_and_review,Disgusting Yet Educational,6,29 January 2021,"""Osmosis Jones"" is a half-animation half-live action film featuring the insides of Frank's body. Osmosis Jones (Chris Rock) is a hard-working white blood cell doing everything he can to keep Frank healthy. Frank (Bill Murray) is slob who eats any and everything against the wishes of his daughter Shane (Elena Franklin).When Frank ingests a hard-boiled egg that fell on the ground, he also ingested a deadly virus called Thrax (Laurence Fishburne). The name Thrax brings to mind anthrax, but I don't think that was the disease/poison intended. Osmosis was doggedly pursuing Thrax with the medicinal help of a gel capsule called Drix (David Hyde Pierce).Throughout the movie there were puns galore about the human body: the germs, immune system, and bodily functions (none of them pleasant). We were also treated to several ""Fear Factor"" style gross moments with vomit, a zit, and other bodily expulsions. Most of the stuff was in animated form, but the Farrelly brothers reserved some of the stomach-turning grossness for live action.As disgusting as this movie was at times, it was pretty funny and slightly educational as well. That didn't make it a movie I'd want to watch again, but it was fine for a one time viewing.",Osmosis Jones
6,neil-476,An original,8,6 September 2009,"Well done to the Farrelly brothers for giving us something rather unusual - an original film.We have a live action framing story of widowed Bill Murray and his daughter - his lack of care over his own welfare leads him to eat an egg, the germs on which cause him to become so sick that his life is threatened.And the development of the illness and the battle to prevent it spreading and to save his life are shown to us in animation by way of a stylised police/crime story, featuring a number of clichés to make the events more recognisable to us (the demoted/disgraced cop, the corrupt mayor, the irascible police captain etc.) The film switches between the two, and this works absolutely perfectly. The animation is excellent, the animation design is very good, and the voice talent is flawless.Some of the material is pitched at a near-adult level - the Farelly's are not noted for their good taste - so concerned parents should perhaps preview the tape to see if it meets their particular standards.An unusual and very good film",Osmosis Jones
7,anaconda-40658,Bill's Dentist Appointment.,7,1 September 2015,"Osmosis Jones (2001): Dir (live): Bobby Farrelly, Peter Farrelly / Dir (animated scenes): Piet Kroon, Tom Sito / Cast: Bill Murray, Molly Shannon, Chris Elliott, Elena Franklin / Voices: Chris Rock: Creative and unique animation. Bill Murray plays an out of shape father who is constantly warned by his daughter to watch his eating habits. Soon a deadly virus begins to spread throughout his body. It is up to animated blood cell Osmosis Jones and his partner Drix to destroy evil virus Thrax. Live footage is directed by Peter and Bobby Farrelly who are famous for great comedies such as Kingpin and There's Something About Mary. Animated sequences are directed by Piet Kroon and Tom Sito who are given the best part of the film. Animated characters are cool and carry the film but the live performances are flat. Bill Murray holds his own as this unhealthy eater who ends up in the down and out and must rely on Jones to triumph and recreate his health. Molly Shannon has the misfortune of having a zit explode on her face. Chris Elliott has a cardboard role of Murray's brother and co-worker. Elena Franklin is flat as Murray's daughter who cares for her father and his welfare. The voice talents fare much better with Chris Rock leading the way as the free spirited Osmosis Jones whose mission is to render Bill Murray healthy. Creative and well meaning comedy about responsible living. Score: 7 / 10",Osmosis Jones
8,movieman_kev,hard to digest,4,5 June 2005,"Frank (Bill Murray) falls victim to flu like symptoms after he eats an egg that has been in a monkey's mouth then on the ground. It's up to a white blood cell and an cold tablet to save the day. They find out it's not a flu, but the deadly new disease Thrax, who wants to kill Frank in 48 hours. Imagine ""Lethal Weapon"" crossed with ""Fantastic Voyage"", only mostly animated and dumbed down considerable and you'll know what this film is all about. Yawn inducing to adults, to intense for little kids, and not enough 'potty/puke' humor for teens. Farelly Brothers have struck out with this one. An obvious sore spot on an otherwise unblemished career. (thus far. I haven't seen ""Fever Pitch"", yet) Wait I'll just lay all the blame on that hack Marc Hyman instead.My Grade: D DVD Extras: Commentary by Animation Directors Piet Kroon and Tom Sito, Writer Marc Hyman and Producer Zak Penn ; ""Frank's Gross Anatomy"" Interactive Adventure; HBO First Look Behind-The-Scenes featurette (14 minutes); Voice Recording Sessions (5 minutes); Deleted Scenes (5 minutes, 49 seconds); and Theatrical Trailer 3 Easter Eggs: Go to the 'Theatrical Trailer' then highlight the ""Gas Next Exit"" sign for a bonus clip; select The Earl Of Hurl in the Frank's Gross Anatomy"" and select ""The Earl Of Hurl"" highlight the Funny Bone for another clip; In Subtitles, go to the next page, DVD Credits then highlight Drix's head for an unused theatrical Trailer.",Osmosis Jones
9,MovieAddict2016,"Good premise, but it wears thin fast",5,2 September 2005,"This was an odd directorial choice for the Farrelly Brothers (""Dumb and Dumber,"" ""There's Something About Mary""). It's an animated film (in parts) about the internal workings of a man's body.The man is played by Bill Murray during the ""live action"" sequences. These are intercut with animated sequences that involve cells and amoebas and organs and so on and so forth voiced by the likes of William Shatner, Chris Rock, Laurence Fishburne, David Hyde Pierce (Niles from ""Frasier""), Kid Rock and Ron Howard.The cells are all animated cartoon characters who look, talk and act like humans. They live in the vast metropolis of ""Frank"" (Murray's character). When he feels sick, the metropolis begins to wither away.Chris Rock voices one of Frank's defending cells who teams up with a special medical pill (swallowed by Frank) to take on Thrax (Fishburne), the maniacal germ causing Frank to feel sick.If you think this sounds really weird, you're right. It is. But it's also very clever and unique.The problem is that the animation is poor, the vocal talents are a bit too self-conscious and the animation is almost too realistic at time - it originally got a PG-13 rating. It's pretty seedy stuff.The live action sequences are okay but Murray looks kind of out of it. Overall I was disappointed because I expected something funnier and cleverer, when in fact the movie dies out really quick and resorts to lame jokes like popping whiteheads on people.",Osmosis Jones
10,OllieSuave-007,Puts the human body into a whole new perspective.,8,13 May 2014,"This is a very cool live-action/animated movie starring Bill Murray as Frank Detorre, who after eating some bad food contracted a life-threatening virus. In the movie, the internal organs of Frank's body is an animated world known as the City of Frank, and is where a policeman white blood cell named Osmosis Jones (Chris Rock) and a cold pill Frank took named Drix (David Hyde Pierce) attempt to stop the virus known as Drax (Lawrence Fishburne) from claiming Frank's life.I thought this movie is very clever and imaginative, putting the human body into a whole new perspective. It makes your ""insides"" seem like an entire and adventurous different world, where in the film the white blood cells are law enforcement officers, lymph nodes are police stations, veins are highways, blood is water/lava, stomach is a bus station, a rowdy club is a pimple, and the germs and bacteria are the criminals.Marc Hyman wrote a fun, imaginative and adventurous script for the movie, cleverly depicting (in animation) how the human body fights infections and sickness. Brothers Bobby and Peter Farrelly did a fine job directing the film, making you suspend reality and imagining your body working like it is depicted in the film. Kudos to the team who did the animation work - bright, colorful and vibrant - nothing like some of those dull-looking and washed-out CGI animation you see nowadays. And, the live-acting and voice casting were great - realistic and believable.As this movie is raged PG, there is also quite a bit of bodily humor, puns and jokes, especially involving digestion, going to the restroom, passing gas, popping pimples from the face, food in the mouth.. (you get the drill). Therefore, you may not want to eat anything while watching this movie. But overall, it's a fun movie for both kids and adults - very entertaining! Grade B+",Osmosis Jones
11,Cineanalyst,Learning About Viruses Through Clichés and Stereotypes,5,29 May 2020,"I suppose ""Osmosis Jones"" may be of some use to lazy teachers or those otherwise lacking access to better educational tools, to learn a bit about the human body and viruses via an animated, Disney-like anthropomorphic depiction of blood cells, germs and such. Otherwise, this is a mostly tired cartoon mixed with live-action scenes. Plus, there's the usual lousy gross-out humor from the Farrelly brothers, which largely undermines the live-action scenes benefiting from the casting of the sardonic Bill Murray. The narrative of the ""Red Death"" virus attacking the city inside Fred's (Murray) body mostly follows a routine buddy cop flick, and the picture borrows other obvious clichés or tropes from other genres (mafia germs in the fashion of ""The Godfather"" (1972), for instance), while characters tend to be nothing more than stereotypes. Even the medical professionals among the characters are made to look more incompetent in the service of a generic climax. Chris Rock's whiny shtick is especially a nuisance in this respect, as he and the writers take his race-based stand-up and repurpose it for body humor--now, he grew up on ""crack,"" as in that dividing the human posterior.The one sequence I like, which nicely blends the animation and live action, is the film-within-the-film, where those inside Fred visit the theatre to watch movies from Fred's life. Simultaneously, the virus temporarily enters Fred's subconscious, which interacts with the motion pictures being screened. The potential implications from psychoanalytic film theory here are, mercifully, played for laughs. Too bad hardly anything else in ""Osmosis Jones"" is amusing.",Osmosis Jones
12,ironhorse_iv,"It's time to cut into the anatomy of this guilty pleasure movie of mine and figure out, why bits of the film is hard to stomach and why some parts is mediocre at best.",6,14 June 2017,"While, this animation movie might appeal to somebody with somewhat bad taste like me. The truth is, that the film doesn't work for everybody. Don't get me wrong, there were plenty of somewhat sophistical & adult-driven clever pun-entertaining moments in the animation sequences directed by Tom Sito if you like this movie & the animation wasn't half bad, even if the very noticeable poor early CGI mixed with hand-drawn, made this film, a bit dated. It was still somewhat beautiful. However, the life-action, unfunny childish toilet humor sequences from the Farrelly brothers, kinda dumb down, the film to standstill. Because of that, I can't say, this movie is a good movie. Nevertheless, I also can't say, it's awful. It's somewhat in the middle. Still, there is plenty of flaws in the film to point out. One of the biggest complains of the movie produced by Warner Bros, is the fact that the life action scenes with Frank Detorre (Bill Murray) doesn't intermixed well, with the hand-drawn animation in his body. It's kinda jarring to see, actors reenacted short scenes on camera film footage, only to be badly edited into a film, mostly, full of animation cels. In my opinion, the whole movie should be, all animated! Yes, I know, it would be, more expensive to produce, but at least, the movie would had been, a little more, well-made. Another problem between the live action and animation parts is the pacing. While, the animation move in a pretty solid action pack pace, with white blood cell, officer Osmosis Jones (Voiced by Chris Rock) having to team up, with a cold pill, Drixenol ""Drix"" Koldreliff (Voiced by David Hyde Pierce), in order to stop a deadly virus, known as Thrax (Voiced by Laurence Fishburne) from killing Frank in a pretty generic buddy cop clichés storyline. I really didn't care for the repetitive gross out and pointless dialogue scenes that they gave Bill Murray to do. Honestly, without spoiling the movie, too much, there was no reason, why Frank needed to reenact with comedian, Molly Shannon's character, as she wasn't any help nor a major foe for Frank. The film would be, better off, without her. Have the film establish, that Jones accidentally causing the death of Frank's wife, by allowing a virus to escape Frank's body, instead of him, causing the vomiting at the science fair, that got Frank in trouble. At least, the movie would had more stalks, plus it would be a better backstory and reason, why the depressed Frank is letting himself go, health wise than what the film gave Murray, with Frank being annoying clueless and too unlikeable lazy at being healthy. Also, I think the movie would had made more sense, if Frank was working at a desk job at the zoo, rather than the field. Why? It's because, it just hard to believe, that Frank would be, really that unhealthy with all the manual back breaking work, he does, like shoveling and washing animals in the hot sun. A desk job works better, because of the lack of physical activity. Sadly, the movie doesn't do this, and the live action scenes really dragged. Honestly, the whole conflict with Frank, choosing a trip to Buffalo over his daughter, Shane (Elena Franklin) camping trip was also not needed. Regardless of him, going or not, Frank's health would had still decline, due to Thrax. Also, with all anthropomorphization aside, anyone who's passed a biology class knows that germs & viruses don't work even remotely like they're depicted in the film. Though they can be harmful to the host that they infest, they aren't biologically programmed to quickly kill it. They mostly reproduce by multiplying and spreading throughout its body over time, feeding on the resources. Any harmful symptoms are simply side-effects of over population and damage of cells. Regardless of the artistic license with the science. Laurence Fishburne was amazing as the villain. The things, his character does, is very haunting and his voice acting matches that. It really surprised me, that's this movie was PG, seeing, how Thrax rips, another germ apart, and cause, a saliva boat to explode in flames. I thought, it would be, at least, PG-13, due to the violence and bodily humor. It didn't help that the lyrics to the Kid Rock's song wasn't kid-friendly as well. This movie is surely, not PG! Gross humor, aside, I didn't like, how the film handle the mentally handicap, obesity, and other issues. Regardless of the botch crudely done moral message, 'Osmosis Jones' is still truly imaginative, innovative and fun with alright voice acting work, even if main star, Chris Rock was a bit annoying with all his standard, generic cockiness, yelling. Still, I felt like I need a detox, after watching this film. Like Junk Food, films like this, should make up a minimal part of your life. Not fully. For the sake of your loves ones. Just stick to healthy & smarter animation choices like 2015's 'Inside Out'. But if you want to junk out on something really childish. Then, you got this film. This autopsy of a mess.",Osmosis Jones
13,UniqueParticle,Underrated treasure,10,8 May 2019,I love this movie so much! I'm one of very few that is proud to give this a 10 mainly cause it makes me happy & I'm hugely into science! Despite its flaws of ridiculousness in some bits it's a sheer blast in my opinion; Bill Murray and Chris Rock were a delight. Aside from that the Farrelly brothers are great directors.,Osmosis Jones
14,briancham1994,"One bad half, one good half",6,3 December 2020,"The film should have just been animated all the way through. These sequences were very imaginative with lots of anatomical references and cool characters. The only criticism of these parts was that the character personalities were a bit generic and the overall plotline was quite basic (Thrax tries to do something evil, Thrax gets defeated). The live-action sequences were preachy and cheesy all the way through, like a very low budget TV show. Bill Murray does his best to salvage that mess but he is drowned out by constant bodily fluid related ""humour"".",Osmosis Jones

So will Osmosis save Frank's insides in time before the virus gets deadly?I happened to have seen clips of this on Nostalgia Critic's review today and the animation looks very nice(as its in hand-drawn form which I miss as there aren't much hand-drawn films anymore. The film is like the new movie Inside Out meets Space Jam for some strange reason. The voice acting is great that are inside Frank's body(Chris Rock was good,and Lawrence Fishburne who plays the deadly virus who is a villain in this movie btw)were also great.I had to laugh that this was made by Farrelly Brothers(yup the dudes that were over my favourite comedy of all time Dumb And Dumber)but if you love animated /live action movies than check it out.",Osmosis Jones
16,kevin_robbins,This is a fairly average to below average addition to the genre that once you watch it you never need to see if again,4,22 August 2021,"Osmosis Jones (2001) is a movie my daughter and I recently watched together on HBOMax. The storyline follows a white blood cell policemen of sorts who works in an aging man's body who doesn't eat or treat his body well. A virus seems to be working its way into the man's body but only the police officer that's a white blood cell seems to notice. He will do his best to convince those around him it's true and kill the virus before it kills the man. This movie is directed by Bobby & Peter Farrelly (Hall Pass) and contains the voices of Chris Rock (CB4), Laurence Fishburne (The Matrix), Ron Howard (The Andy Griffin Show) and David Hyde Pierce (Frasier). The storyline for this picture was just okay. This film had a good but not great voices for the characters, animation, soundtrack and villain. I generally like Bill Murray but also thought he was just okay in this. Overall this is a fairly average to below average addition to the genre that once you watch it you never need to see if again.

20,fntstcplnt,Osmosis Jones (2001),2,29 November 2019,"Directed by Bobby Farrelly, Peter Farrelly, Tom Sito & Piet Kroon. Starring Bill Murray, Elena Franklin, Chris Elliott, Molly Shannon, (voices) Chris Rock, David Hyde Pierce, Laurence Fishburne, William Shatner, Brandy Norwood, Joel Silver, Billy West, Ron Howard. (PG)A fast-talking white blood cell detective (Rock) teams up with a cold pill (Pierce) to stop a sinister virus (Fishburne) from killing its host, unhealthy zookeeper Murray. Live action/animated hybrid (Murray's world is ""real,"" his insides are unconvincingly portrayed as a cartoon city) is about as fun as the flu, full of lowest common denominator gross-out gags, pop culture references, and wisecracks as ""hip"" as alcoholism. No one seems to be putting forth much effort on either side of the screen (the acting is especially lazy from most participants), and the animation is flat and generic--most Disney direct-to-video features even look better. Rock's ""hero"" is made to be obnoxious the moment he first appears (while inexplicably ogling a DNA molecule pinup, he declares, ""Nice genes...you got the chromosomes in all the right places""). Murray, meanwhile, has rarely been so unappealing, a scruffy slob so disgusting that he makes Carl Spackler look like Felix Ungar.

21,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,Gorgeous animation undermined by out-of-place live action gross-out humour.,5,7 September 2020,"This film's an odd beast: the story for the animated sequences for the most part works really well, but the live-action sequences that unfortunately push the story forward undermine the animation's reluctant superiority to the film's A-plot. Bill Murray is not the quirky charmer you see in Ghostbusters or Groundhog Day, but instead a really dense zookeeper whose sense of hygiene would make even lax germaphobes shriek in terror. And Bill Murray's immunity system is voiced by Chris Rock: a white-blood-cell cop that's all about the one-liners and proving he's not just a laughing stock joke.This film's... an interesting story in box office flops from the 2000s: this film went through development hell because there wasn't a story realised through the live-action sequences when they started production: Bill Murray was kind of attached as an afterthought. This film really shines with the animated sequences and sinks with the Farley Brothers-directed live sequences with Murray. The two styles just don't mesh together at all. There's a good half of a film here undermines by another that doesn't feel like a natural companion for a cop-centric story.It's watchable and competently made, but the whole live-action/animation mixing is a far-cry from seamless and can be distracting in an involuntary way. It's an extravagant experience of 'aesthetic turbulence' from Hollywood.",Osmosis Jones
22,emasterslake,Bill Murray could of been funnier.,5,10 May 2006,"I didn't see this movie till sometime after it was released in theaters. I didn't know who Bill Murray was at first when I saw this film on TV.Osmosis Jones is about Bill Murray portraying a very unhealthy zoo keeper who's a loser in a way of saying. We get to see what's happening inside him. As white blood cells are fighting off germs and bacteria. The human body is a whole different world microscopically.White Blood cells and red blood cells are like citizens, the stomach is like an airport, and the Brain is like a town hall/core.Osmosis Jones is a White Blood cell. Who isn't getting the respect or luck in being a cop. When a virus enters the human body Osmosis gets team up with a Pill person who is made to a eliminate germs, colds, flu, and other symptoms.Can these 2 unlikely heroes stop the virus from destroying the human body? This movie is OK to watch. Has some funny moments, but not too memorable. Chris Rock has the spotlight in this movie.

23,Animany94,A mixed bag.,6,12 December 2018,"I had never heard of Osmosis Jones before, but I grew up watching the animated series based on this movie so I went into it with excitement and a nostalgic drive.What I got was rather mixed. Let me explain.The live-action parts pretty much sucked in my opinion. This guy named Frank (Bill Murray) is a single father taking care of his daughter and is a really unlikable father figure. How are we supposed to sympathise with a lazy and egotistical doof? I never felt sorry for him one minute. Mix that with gross-out humour which wasn't even helped the slightest by Bill Murray who is usually really funny.Enough said about that, because the animated segments were actually pretty awesome. The world inside Frank's was impressive by how it was crafted. How it functions by having a whole community run by a mayor (William Shatner) and a police force of white blood cells and a lot of real-life city stuff showcased a lot of creative effort was put into it.It centers on a white blood cells Osmosis Jones (Chris Rock) who is that kind of cop who does things his own way and the others at the police station do not approve of his ways, but he is later assigned to a new case with a partner to keep him on track, a cold pill named Drix (David Hyde Pierce). Sure, it follows all the buddy cop movie clichés with nothing new added, but the world they must explore and the colorful characters they meet make it entertaining albeit predictable.Speaking of the colorful cast of characters, the most interesting and memorable of them all has to be the villian Thrax (Laurence Fishburne) who is menacing and merciless and has a deathcount very high for a PG rated movie.Without being boring I found that Chris Rock and David Hyde Pierce seemed to do their usual schtick with Rock being hip and a loudmouth and Hyde Pierce doing his quirky and excentric british gentleman voice. But Fishburne surprised me. He could as easily just have put on his Morpheus voice, but he didn't. I'll give him more credit for that.The live-action segments is the movie's biggest drawbacks with an unlikable main character and lowbrow humour as you would expect from the farelly brothers, and frankly (no pun intented) the animated segments aren't perfect and the transitions between the two don't always work.But overall Osmosis I found Osmosis Jones enjoyable, but flawed. I understand why it failed in theaters, but I have seen so much worse elsewhere.",Osmosis Jones

With the help of his new teammate, a pill recently swallowed by their host, they must fight against a very serious threat who plans to kill Frank in less than 48 hours.Contrary to my expectations, this movie isn't totally animated as the series it's based on, Frank and his miserable life being filmed in reality. It wouldn't have been such a big fuss if the actors weren't completely retarded and unpleasant, playing stupid roles in a very bad manner. Not to say that it was gross in a lot of such scenes...The story is as linear, expected and simplistic as it gets, so you'd think that it can provide something through its animated part...Well it doesn't. It's animation is O.K. but nothing more, voice acting is sometimes off while the action is boring and mostly predictable, when it's not too stupid to endure. Thankfully they thought to insert some good music throughout the picture, making the experience a bit more ""enjoyable"".Maybe I had high expectations from this movie as the series provided a pleasant view for me as a child, but except the two main characters, it didn't have anything for me to enjoy. Unfortunately, as a whole, it's a big letdown which I cannot recommend to anyone.",Osmosis Jones

But no matter what, something about their obnoxious humor wins me over every time. Almost,every time. Recently, I saw a film that I missed out on, called Osmosis Jones.It took them years to direct a smart movie. I mean, there are a lot of scientific facts in this movie, used as jokes.Ironicaly, though its their smartest work, I also found it to be their worst work to date. Not that I dislike it when Rated R people go PG, but I felt that Osmosis Jones tried too hard.The film revolves around a victim,named Frank(Bill Murray). Going on in his body is the flu. And it's up to Osmosis Jones(voiced by Chris Rock) and Drix(voiced by David Hyde Peirce) to stop it.The majority of the cast here works. Everyone except Chris Rock. To me, I felt that Chris Rock was too much of a distraction. Despite him, the rest of the cast is funny. And some of the jokes are kind of clever also.The main reason why I bash Osmosis Jones is that its too childish. I mean, The Farrelly's have written some disgusting things(dick stuck in zipper, Jim Carrey having a breast milk mustache), but here,when they do it, its gross. There is a scene where Frank's zit pops on Molly Shannon's face. It's disgusting.Also, some of their jokes don't work. Though some are clever. All i'm saying is that they could've done better here. Though its the smartest movie they've ever done, I also think it's the worst. Compared to the gross out things the brothers have done before.C+",Osmosis Jones
27,Movie-12,"Not extremely funny, but it sure is imaginative and energetic. ***1/2 (out of four).",8,17 August 2001,"OSMOSIS JONES / (2001) ***1/2 (out of four)By Blake French:Consider the Farrelly brothers. The majority of a crowd would think of adjectives like shocking and envelope pushing, to describe them, but the most shocking thing about ""Osmosis Jones,"" is the PG rating. Originally warranted a PG-13 rating, still a surprise from filmmakers whose credits include ""There's Something About Mary"" and ""Me, Myself, and Irene,"" the film finally earned the family friendly PG rating after it was subjected to a re-rating. Peter and Bobby Farrelly are known for their crude, rude, and disgusting sense of humor. Breaking free of their traditional styles, their focus is now on something a little more entertaining than gross-out humor-imagination.Directing a wildly amusing script by Marc Hyman, the Farrelly bothers are really on to something here. This is arguably their best film to date. Only ""There's Something About Mary"" stands up against ""Osmosis Jones,"" a film that jumps between live action and cartoon animation. It calculates each moment with the perfect timing. This is not a movie just for this kids, although it's perfectly appropriate for everyone in the family. This is a feast for anyone's imagination. ""Osmosis Jones"" creates a world we seldom see in the movies-inside the human body.""Osmosis Jones"" is not an extremely funny movie. Only a handful of plentiful laughs occurs in the film. None of the gross-out humor works; the ideas are too jumbled within other ideas to payoff. ""Osmosis Jones"" does play with a lot of different humor types-from a clever ""Titanic"" joke that practically winks at the audience, to a laugh out loud performance by SNL veteran Molly Shannon. In ""Superstar"" Shannon proved to be a nuisance.  However, in this film she is a very welcome screen presence.Bill Murray needs to be in more movies these days. He still has the comic connection with the audience that carried ""Scrooged,"" his best film, to my list of all time favorites. He stars as Frank Detorri, a lazy, slothful zoo worker who would get life behind bars if hygiene was a law. His wife passed away because of a sickness that their young, but healthy and intelligent, daughter (Elena Franklin) believes evolved from poor eating habits.
Frank eats something that contains a deadly virus, and it's up to his immune system to fight back. Osmosis Jones (voiced by Chris Rock) is one of those white blood cells who serves as a cop and must capture various villainous germs and viruses inside Frank. Although not a popular individual among the world of Frank, especially with the Mayor (voiced by William Shater), who is running for re-election very soon, he does have a crush on his assistant, Leah (voiced by Brandy Norwood). After the virus, named Thrax (voiced by Laurence Fishburne), accumulates villainous help and starts on a plan to kill Frank in a record time of forty eight hours,  Osmosis must work with a cold pill named Drix (voiced by David Hyde Pierce), to stop this monstrously powerful germ before it's too late for Frank and his daughter.The movie has some very clever material-various parts of the body represent neighborhoods in the City of Frank. For instance, the stomach is the airport with frequent departures to the colon. The Mafia relaxes in a steam room located in the armpit. Lawyers hang out in a hemorrhoid. When a zit pops up, it's seemingly the party room for the entire body, complete with a dance floor and strippers. Just simple content like that makes ""Osmosis Jones"" worth a watch. Even adults will enjoy the live action humor, as well as the film's zest, energy, and irony.In a time when summer movies are at an all time low, ""Osmosis Jones"" is here to save they day. It's one of the most clever films of the year.",Osmosis Jones

I thought it was a very inventive story, and quite interesting.

If you're a fan of the Farrelly brothers, then you'll probably want to see this film.

The story is full of funny if sometimes gross humor works for the story that works. But it's more then goofy gross site gags, it had a heart. The interaction between Frank and his daughter is funny, sweet and touching. The acting is great, the dialog is great.

I think that, between this and ""the Iron Giant"", Warner Brothers Animation has GOT to spring for a better promotion department.  Really, all they'd have to say is something like: ""We just let the creators of 'Something About Mary' and 'Dumb and Dumber' make their own cartoon.  Brace yourselves.""All complaints aside, and none of them are really the movie's fault, this is one of the most inventive animated films I've seen in a very long time.  The characters and backgrounds are allowed to look and move in ways that are downright refreshingly bizarre.  The visuals are very imaginative.  The humor, while funny, is still very much what you'd expect from a Farelly Brothers movie that takes place inside a very sick man, so I wouldn't recommend it to little kids or the weak of stomach.

I think it's because how do you market a film like this? Since this takes place in the human body, there's all kinds of gross out humour in it. Some of it is too much for a PG rated film. That's my biggest problem with this film and why it wasn't marketed very well. It's gross. The scene where the nose dam breaks and a giant tidal wave of snot comes out is not what you're mean to see in a family film. Especially on the big screen. The scene where Frank vomits on the teacher and it is shown in a newspaper headline, we actually see the vomit. You don't show people vomiting in a PG film. Not only that, but it's part of the story. Making gross out gags part of the story is not a good idea.Also, the scene where the zit is ready to pop, we get a big giant close up on it which is enough to make anyone cringe. It's almost like Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt. A show loaded with gross out humour. But that was for adults. This is meant to be a family film.Now, the stuff I do like about it; the animation is great, it's very creative, (making the stomach the airport, the brain is city hall, the armpits are the steam room, I could go on)Laurence Fishburne was fantastic as Thrax. I kept forgetting it was him. Even if you don't like this film, you have to admit, Thrax is awesome. The music's great too. I like all the body puns as well.Not a film for everyone, but has gained a cult following on DVD.",Osmosis Jones
34,BadWebDiver,"Great idea, well presented.",9,5 January 2005,"This was a very clever idea, that effectively shows a live-action sequence, then presents the interior of a character's (Frank - Bill Murray) body in animation. The voice characters play cells and viruses withing Frank's body. I thought it was an excellent idea, very educational and entertaining at the same time. It reminded me of the classic Disney educational animated specials like ""Donald Duck in Mathamagic Land"" and ""Goofy on Defensive Driving"", and the Ludvik von Drake shorts about the atom and such stuff.The voice casting was uniformly excellent, with a great range and personality. There were several great sight gags and action sequences in the animated sections, as well as some brilliant film spoofs (I particularly loved the TITANIC spoof and the JAWS - or general monster movie - spoof especially).The live-action is somewhat overshadowed by the animation, but Bill Murray does play an eccentric everyman character very well - very reminiscent of his early role in CADDYSHACK, where I first noticed him. The whole zoo setting seem a little off-beat, it made me think of FIERCE CREATURES, though not as much fun. The daughter was okay, if a bit bland. And there's a great comic bit featuring actor Will Dunn as a science student which sets off a great gross-out gag.I agree with the comments this is primarily seen as a kids movie, even though it does contain a near-death scene.

I'm guessing most people were just expecting a Disney type of movie.This is a great movie for kids, not because it is part cartoon, but also because it has plenty of great science facts in it. This is a fun way for kids to learn what would probably bore them to death in a class room.This is part animation, and live action. The best scenes are the scenes that take place inside of Frank, because the live action scenes don't have much life to them. Some of the live action scenes can be quite gross as well, with the ingrown toenails, the vomiting, and the popping pimples.The animation is great. Chris Rock is great at providing a voice for a white blood cell, and one of my favorite actors, Lawrence Fishburne(Yes, that's Morpheus from The Matrix) is the voice of a disease. He makes a very cool, convincing, and terrifying villain.This is a good movie. Despite it's poor box office success, it is shown on Cartoon Network, it is shown in science classes a lot, and it has a cartoon series based upon it(it's not a very good series though).

It is not funny enough to be a real comedy, but not serious or dramatic enough to pull you in emotionally. It does neither adequately, and suffers for it.3. The villain in it is kinda cool.4.

At the same time the mayor of Frank is doing what he can to cover it up as just a brief cold to avoid panic as the election is coming up.Osmosis Jones is a clever little movie combining animation and real life to tell the story.

There is also a very obvious moral in there; Live healthy and take care of your body. Maybe a little too obvious I think, but it is a kids movie.The acting is great.

44,nucksfan4life,Interesting movie,6,6 September 2002,"I wasn't sure if I wanted to see this movie because I'd heard rumors about how appallingly disgusting it was. There are really only a few parts that the weak-stomached may not be able to digest. There have many other scenes in movies that way more disgusting than this movie. That said, ""Osmosis Jones"" is a pretty interesting movie in that it manages to follow two separate story lines (filmed in different medium: live action and animation) fairly well. First we have Frank, played by Bill Murray, who is a slob. His daughter Shane has had enough of his ways. Frank's slobbish ways allow him to swallow food with a nasty virus named Thrax. Moving to the animated story line, Osmosis Jones (voiced by Chris Rock) is a white-blood-cell that discovers the virus and must stop him from killing Frank, and all the people (cells) in Frank's body.I found myself interested in each story line, and the transfers between live action and animation kept the movie exciting.

45,ShinKyo81,"""Ozzy"" is really a cell of a guy!!!",9,19 September 2001,"""Osmosis Jones"" is a very funny, entertaining and clever film brought by the Farrelly brothers, creators of comedies like ""Dumb and Dumber"", ""There's Something About Mary"" and ""Me, Myself & Irene"". I've seen the two firsts, and I must say that the best of all is ""Osmosis Jones"". It combines two story lines: the story of Frank Detorri (Bill Murray), a disgusting man with a disgusting life too. And the other story line is where the animation takes part and recreates all the inside of Frank's body. This last one is the main part of the film, where we find our white blood cell cop ""Osmosis Jones"" (Chris Rock), followed by his partner Drix (David Hyde Pierce), a cold tablet, in order to prevent the body from the attack of the evil and powerful virus Thrax (Lawrence Fishburne). At first glance, the plot seems cheesy and typical, but the movie is an incredible combination of brilliant animation, incredible CGI, fantastic characters and dialogues and very funny gags. I never expected a cartoon movie from the Farrelly brothers. I mean, they have changed a lot their style from ""There's something..."". You still find some scatological elements, but all the action in Frank's body is really good and surprising. For example, the neurones are represented as telephone operators, the stomach is like an airport, the bladder is like a harbor, you find turrets shooting snots inside the nose and so on.
The two main characters Ozzy and Drix are quite similar to Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in the ""Lethal Weapon"" series. You know, two cops, one quite mad and risky, the other cold and more serious... Also you can find cameos from ""The Matrix"" and ""Titanic"", but I would like to mention the appearance of KIDNEY ROCK in the film. Of course, we're talking about KID ROCK, the famous US rock star, considered by himself and lots of fans like the PIMP of the nation. In Europe, it's not very popular, but I consider myself fan of his work, and I really enjoyed his appearance in ""Osmosis Jones"", followed by his small pal Joe C., who sadly died a few months ago.So, go to the cinema right now and watch the movie:1. If you like animation movies full of action 2. If you are interested in medicine 3.

The way that Bill Murray lives his life in this movie is downright wrong and gross but can be pretty funny watching him go by his ten second rule in eating things. His disgusting life style is shown through his body which is imaginatively run like a city basically making sure that he stays healthy all his life and that he lives life well.

There was the NNN, a news network which stood for Neuron News Network I guess?  There was the ticker scrolling along the bottom with sports scores with creatively named teams.  I can't remember what they were called but they were like the Ectoplasm or whatever. Obviously the Farrelly brothers created a whole other world within the body and they did it very well.  I enjoyed the mayor and his attempts to try to keep Bill Murray fat because then he was happy and would be easier to control.  It's amazing that one can even politicized the opinions of cells!! This movie had some very funny moments.  It wasn't as consistently funny as for exmple Dumb and Dumber or There's Something about Mary, but I think this was a more clever film.

52,Zombie-Kermit,A Fantastic Movie That Doesn't Get the Recognition it Deserves.,7,24 December 2007,"When most people think of the Farrelly Brothers they think more of movies like ""Theres Something About Mary"" and ""Dumb and Dumber,"" but Osmosis Jones is a movie that went largely unnoticed. This movie is great, it has a storyline like you would expect by some bad short you watch at school in health class... but done right. What more can a person ask for in an animated world than Chris Rock as a white blood cell fighting off a nasty virus voiced by Laurence Fishburne. You also have Bill Murray in the live action side of the movie playing the unclean and gross, yet lovable Frank. David Hyde Pierce was also great as the Cold Pill named Drix.The animation is really cool, and I guess you could sort of say it's one of the last good animated movies made, seeing as the world has been taken over with CGI (Which is not necessarily a bad thing... it's just nice to see a traditionally animated movie.) I would also like to make comment on the designs of the inside of Frank... they were pretty cool.Of course there is lots of toilet humour and innuendo... but it's all in good fun. Some people may be a bit grossed out though during some scenes. I would recommend you don't let your kids watch this movie if they are under the age of about eight, as there are some dark themes involving death in it.Basically the animation is great, the characters are memorable and the movie is just a whole lot of fun. So the bottom line is if you see this in a shop... I would give a very high recommendation to rent or even buy this. It's just a really good movie.",Osmosis Jones

The cells moved like they were supposed to move. The world it painted looked interesting and pretty unique.2. The characters that are animated are great but the live action ones are terrible. Ozzy is funny, Drix is smart but has his own comedic side and the villains Thrax is great! Too bad that the humans are dull, gross and unintelligent morons that couldn't tie their own shoes. The daughter is smarter than her father and even then she's still bad at acting.3. The comedy is well done. I liked Ozzy and Drix with their funny banter. The other side characters are also very funny. Too bad that the human comedy is gross out humor that only a four year old could laugh at.4. The story is pretty nice. Thrax the virus tries to kill Frank in 48 hours so he can beat his record at killing humans. Ozzy and his new pal Drix are the only ones who can stop Thrax and have to work together. It's clique yes but it works. The humans...aren't very important with the story and are there just because.Like I've stated before it's the humans that ruined the movie. It's good but cut out the humans and this would be way better!",Osmosis Jones

And whaddaya know?  I was right!The plot *basic plot, small spoilers* involves a slob named Frank (Bill Murray) who eats an egg that a monkey stole from him and put in its mouth (which ALONE shows you how little he cares about his health!) which carries a evil virus named Thrax (voice of Laurence Fishburne).  Enter Frank's germ-fighting forces, led by rogue white blood cell Osmosis Jones (voice of Chris Rock) and 12-hour cold capsule Drix (voice of David Hyde Pierce) who are, as Ozzy's license plate reads, ""da cure"".  Laurence Fishburne makes Thrax's character seem quite villainous, with his low, evil voice and garb.  He makes his point clear that the Ebola virus is a case of dandruff compared to him, using only a large finger to send various cells frying.  Chris Rock and David Hyde Pierce get some humorous lines, playing off each other ""good cop, bad cop"" style. 
This movie also uses body humor, like a stream of snot (inside Frank's nose, natch).  I do think that some might be a bit disgusted by it, though (I won't spoil everything, just watch for yourself).  But, that's what our bodies are: huge, disgusting piles of gore that we all can laugh at. 
I believe Chris Rock's voice is suitable for animation, and he should do some more like Osmosis.

57,dear_prudence,The inside scoop,8,13 August 2001,"This film is the product of extremely vibrant imaginations.  It is hard not to marvel at the very idea of this film, and it proved to go well beyond my expectations as the filmmakers took me through the bustling labyrinth of Bill Murray's insides.For those reasons, you should see this movie.  I would be remiss, however, if I left out the fact that there is a side of this movie that is a little hard to take.  Without giving it away, I'd just like to warn the viewers that on the outside of Bill Murray's character's body is an emotionally drippy plot that is supposed to make the audience feel something through its thickly coated sentimentality.  Yuck.  It is poorly done, bordering insulting.  Luckily, we spend most of the film watching his insides, and that is where the real treasure is.",Osmosis Jones
58,jacob rosen,"Pleasant, Unassuming, Limited",7,1 September 2001,"The Farrelly Brothers try their hand at mixing their warped style of transgressive comedy with family accessibility and the results are generally agreeable if not overwhelming. Part live action, part animation, it's a spin on buddy pictures that takes place in zookeeper Bill Murray's body, where a rogue virus (the voice of Laurence Fishburne) plots to kill Murray while a disgraced police cell (no pun intended) voiced by Chris Rock teams with a cold pill (the voice of David Hyde Pierce) to defeat him. The film has no great aspirations, preferring to draw on the `Lethal Weapon' series and `Toy Story' for its inspiration and the animation, while compelling, is reminiscent of old, one-dimensional Hanna-Barbera cartoons, specifically `The Jetsons'. The gags are naturally about bodily functions and there's lots of playfulness with names and concepts. But the audience these gags are aimed at--the pre-teen crowd--will find most of them going over their heads.",Osmosis Jones
59,Stoli_Raz_N_7,Farrelly Brothers on Animation,6,3 November 2001,"What was great about this movie? The cast, the crew, the story, and the animation. What was bad about this movie? Well, the animated story is cool, and even though it deals with the body and bodily functions, there wasn't anything really bothersome or disgusting in it. Which is why I was happy to take my girlfriend and her son to see this film. But during the live action parts of the film, the Farrelly Brothers returned to their true comedic film making form where nothing is taboo or out of bounds, and gross-out equals funny. My girlfriend nearly puked about four different times during the live action portions of the film. She stormed out of the theater before the credits even began rolling because she hated the live action so much. Somehow it all became my fault. Fortunately she dumped me recently, so her opinion on this film means squat to me now. But I would have to stand, as a critic, on the ground that the animated sequences of the film did not flow smoothly into the gross live action scenes. It's almost as if you are getting top-notch Don Bluth post-Titan A.E. animation, then you have to cinch up your stomach and settle into barf-and-zit-popping comedy served up Farrely Brothers' style. It just didn't mix well at all. Everything else was fantastic. The cast, the animation, the story, the soundtrack, the back-story, the overt sub-plots, everything. The only real problem was that the two parts of the story didn't blend well. It would have been better if either Matt Groening or Mike Judge had directed the animated story so that it would be more adult oriented humor, or if Ivan Reitman or someone of his ilk had directed the live action bits so that it would have been more family oriented humor. Because trying to do both in the same film doesn't work.",Osmosis Jones
60,Webslinger48,It's unimpressiveness is impressive...,3,1 August 2001,"I've read a few of the other (positive) comments about Osmosis Jones and I'm convinced they must've been written by WB marketing folks...this movie sucks.  The audience I saw it with was largely quiet and seemed as uninvolved in it as I was.  About the only thing going for it is the vocal talent (Rock, Fishburne, Pierce, Shatner) but even that ended up being disappointing.  The concept just doesn't work.  There's a major disconnect between the live action sequences with Frank (Bill Murray) in the real world (which make up perhaps 1/3 of the movie) and theanimated sequences of what's going on inside his body.  For me, this very cartoony anthropomorphic world of his internal organisms (the animation design reminds me of the Simpsons a little bit) just cannot possibly exist at all in the real world...yet we are supposed to believe that Frank's white blood cells look like Smurf/Bart Simpson hybrids and sound like Chris Rock...it was just impossible for me to suspend my disbelief as the film cuts back and forth between these two completely different universes. 
That said, I guess the filmmakers do what they can with it, the way they visualize the city of Frank (the inhabitants refer to his brain as Cerebellum Hall, the armpits are where all of the evil bacteria and viruses hang out and veins are shown as busy highways) is somewhat clever but, again, entirely too fantastic to exist in the real world.  And then when these wholly disparate worlds collide, and
the animated micro-organisms are literally travelling from one person to another AND THEN BACK AGAIN via phlegm and tears in the real world...well, that's when the impossible becomes
TOTALLY LUDICROUS.And it doesn't help that all of the live-action actors (notably Murray, Molly Shannon and Chris Elliott) appear to just be collecting paychecks.  Murray has achieved a new low here...I enjoyed his recent turns in `Rushmore' and `Charlie's Angels' but this is just plain embarrassing for him.  The Farrelly brothers just must've told him to be as disgusting and slovenly as possible, which is fine I guess but that's all he has to do in this and what a waste of his talent.  And the result is we just don't care about his character...he's repugnant and an idiot.  So what if the Thrax (the virus) causes him to die?  The audience feels no sympathy towards Murray and that is the fatal flaw of the film.And really, I expected more of Rock...there are a couple of scenes where it looks like he was able to improvise and do his thing but for the most part the filmmakers keep him on a pretty short leash and stick to the script, and I really think that an opportunity may have been missed there.  Used properly, I think Rock could do great voice-overs for animated films.Oh yeah, one more thing...why can't a comedic film come out without some dumb film parody in it?  You've seen the action in the Matrix parodied a million times already...well add another attempt (very feeble at that) to the list.  It's really getting annoying, and pedestrian animated films like this one really have no new insights to add as far as that parody goes. That's what we have Simpsons and South Park for.One final note...I had this weird feeling when I walked out of the theater...as if the film just didn't work, and I knew the movie reminded me of another, but I couldn't remember what at first. Then it came to me...remember `The Last Action Hero'?  That film left me with that same feeling, because Arnold Schwarzenneggar plays the role of a movie character that comes to life in the real world.  It was just totally impossible to believe and renders the film - no matter how well it's done and how well everything else is conceived - toothless.  And Osmosis Jones falls flat for the same reason.  Audiences can suspend their disbelief...but only to a certain point.",Osmosis Jones

Another warning is to be sure and make sure your pause/reverse/slow button on your DVD remote is in good order 'cause you'll want to use it to catch all the gags. Just like the Simpson's is a VCR show (meaning you need to tape it and slow/pause it to catch the background jokes), so too is this movie! There is extra stuff going on in the background and signs that go by a bit too quick for the eye, but are hilarious! Everyone does a bang up job, live and voice acting. The animation is old school which is fine, because it works for this one and is stylish and fun! An extra tip of the hat to David Hyde Pierce, he once again lends a great voice job to his character.

They'd just see cartoon characters fighting, and be entertained and the whole knowledge of the body would almost have no effect on the kids.This movie felt like something an 8 year old would think if they were taught what we're usually taught in Grade 8 about cells and all that other stuff.I think the largest problem with this movie is that it was made to appeal to kids under 10, but it's directed at kids 13-17. So the kids who that it appeals to don't really get the full joy and benefits of the movie and the kids it's directed at don't usually get interested.Another problem it faces is that this type of story, HAS to be a cartoon, and there are SOME people out there who think that cartoons cannot be good, so once again that age 13-17 age really doesn't take interest",Osmosis Jones

Something about seeing the camera zooming in on a filthy, grungy-looking Bill Murray's mouth as he chewed a boiled egg he picked up off the ground made me never want to eat again. I also dislike most of the voice acting, and the live action and animation dissonance seemed unnecessary. Maybe if the whole thing was animated, they could've pulled something interesting off. 
Overall, it's not recommended. They had a good idea, went way too gross of an angle with it, and ultimately fell short of what they could've done with teaching about how the human body works and whatnot.",Osmosis Jones

There is so much underlying humor in this movie for adults, you cant miss the genius in it. Well Bodily Humor genius that is.  If you can get through the zit popping, puking and other disgusting characteristics of Bill Murray's character and pay attention to David Hyde Pierce and Chris Rock's back and forth then you are bound to leave the movie having had several good belly laughs.

Fishburne dips an octave or two below the tones of his ""Matrix"" alter ego and delivers real power as the virus out to destroy the ""city"" of Frank (Bill Murray), who is to hygiene and nutrition what Gary Condit is to truth and justice.A cold capsule named Drix (David Hyde Pierce) and Frank's Mayor Phlegmming (William Shatner) likewise add to a cast that fairly clicks with hammish appeal, and the animation is top drawer, particularly when Thrax happens upon Frank's subconscious. What lacks is deeper imbedding into Frank's infrastructure (what am I saying??) and more shots at laughs given the pedigree of the actors. After 88 minutes, less was not more.",Osmosis Jones
70,zakso999,"It's a very good film, but I have reservations.",7,14 June 2013,"Osmosis Jones is one of Warner Bros. several animated films that failed at the box office. Some of those films were very good (The Iron Giant), others completely missed (Quest for Camelot). This one is sort of in the middle for my taste. Let me explain.I feel the animated portions are fantastic. The city of Frank is gorgeous to look at, and the characters are well developed. The story is also very engaging, energetic, and fast paced. For a few Kid Rock fans, he makes a cameo with his posse in one scene. These parts alone are worth the price of admission. Which brings me to my main criticism...The live action sequences are boring and uneven. I don't think the audience really cares about the live action scenes. They are obvious filler, they jut out like Excalibur in the stone.

Everytime he's on screen, I squeal in excitement. I really love how mysterious, threatening, charismatic and cool he is. I can definitely see why people have a crush on him. I seriously never thought I'd be attracted to a virus...Cons:The use of CGI is outdated.The live action segments are painful to sit through. The comedy there is cringeworthy and just...gross and almost every live-action character, except Shawn, who's just forgettable and bland, is absolutely horrible. Frank is a selfish, disgusting father and person, Frank's friend is a stupid enabler and Shawn's teacher is a petty bully.The main characters and a couple of other animated characters are pretty generic in concept. Osmosis is the generic underdog, Drix is a ripoff Buzz from Toy Story, Leah is just Osmosis' love interest and the mayor is just the generic, corrupt politician. If it weren't for the voice acting being their saving grace, they'd have no substance.Overall, Osmosis Jones is a mixed bag for me. The animated segments are fun and creative and the live action segments are cringeworthy. If you can ignore the cringe, this film has quite a bit of substance. It's just a shame all the likeableness is inside the worst character Bill Murray has ever played. It almost made me wish Thrax killed him.

This movie was solid, and the creativity was endless; the plot wasn't for everybody, but the more creative and childish you are at heart the more you will enjoy Osmosis Jones.  Rent this movie if your in the mood for a creative film that is like no other to date.  I give it a 7/10.",Osmosis Jones

I watched this with my children. My 10 and 17 year old were about to throw up. In this movie ,the dad acts like a tard. My little ones would watch it every day.One day, they threw away all our movies.I SOLD THE Omosis Jones movie on Ebay. My Grade: F++++++++++++++++ I rather be seen on the worst dress list.My kids now hate this dumb movie. If gives the idea that germs can talk to each other. I wonder how the dumb movie sounds in Japenese. I broke the CD in half when I got irritated of seeing it over and over again. No offence but, Brandy & Elena's acting was the best",Osmosis Jones
83,jarossi,Very fun and imaginative,8,15 November 2001,"I thought this movie was very good.  The people leaving bad reviews are being too critical.  This movie was meant to be fun.  The way the inside of the body is a city, the white blood cells are the police, fireman, etc., the lymph nodes were the police stations, veins were highways, the stomach was a bus station/airport type place, and the germs and bacteria were, of course, the criminals, and so on.  This movie gives a very imaginative way the body works to fight infection, as if the body was a city of people just like in the real world.  You may need to have some sort of knowledge about the body to get some of the puns and jokes, maybe not very young kids will get it, but they will like the animation...this movie is even good for adults.  I give the movie 8/10...I thought it was a very entertaining movie!!!!!",Osmosis Jones
84,anifreak93,Worth watching once- or more!,9,23 December 2008,"I found out the hard way that this movie was definitely not directed at 8 year-olds. Vomit and exploding zits, innocent cells exploding like bubbling lava, and some bodily humor that will fly right over a 2nd grader's head. This doesn't mean the movie is bad. Coming back seven years later, I found the jokes to be funny, especially to biology nuts, and the grosser parts to be bearable. Chris Rock and David Hyde Pierce make an amazing and hilarious team of white blood cell and cold pill, one of the best team of non Disney heroes to ever hit the television screen. Facing off against these two is a nasty virus voice by Laurence Fishburne. Thrax, the Red Death, is one of the most evil villains ever created, easily winning out against many Disney villains. I mean really, you don't get much more evil than a /virus/.This film is sadly underrated, and really is a must-see, just not with your small children.",Osmosis Jones
85,revajoshi,Review...,8,31 May 2019,"This movie is very interesting and also Helps you understand how your body works, it is extremely appropriate for children although there are some scenes that are weird it's something the kids won't notice :)",Osmosis Jones
86,papasmurfisme,Brilliant idea,9,23 September 2007,"I think that Osmosis Jones was a very well thought out movie. I liked that it sort of explained what your body was made of but in a CG funny way. I thought that the way that it was trying to get rid of the virus or *red death* it was very well done. It was good funny, informing, and entertaining. There were some gross parts like when Franks zit popped and when Frank puked all over the teacher. But it was still funny. I wouldn't recommend it to kids under 8 because of some really gross parts and there are some parts that are a little scary because of the red death kills some of the germs. Also there is some adult language and content. But other than that a very well done movie.9/10",Osmosis Jones

Truly fits the billing ""PERFECT FOR ALL AGES!!""",10,10 April 2005,"I love this movie, and consider it to be a classic animated film---bought this just today and was more than just pleasantly surprised---I was SO glad that I bought it!!!It had my entire family laughing, from the oldest (72) to the youngest (4) from start to finish!! Just cant say enough about this movie, I am so glad that I got a chance to see it, and am Positive that I will be watching this film over and over! I would recommend this movie to EVERYONE!It has everything for everyone:Bill Murray: (One of his funniest movies--and thats saying a lot!) Great Animation: (More than just eye candy, it puts a hilarious spin on the inside of our bodies, and funny ideas about whats going on in there!) Chris Rock: (Great how well he fit this part) William Shatner: (Perfectly Cast as the Mayor of Bill Murrays Brain) Molly Shannon: (Plays great with Bill Murray as his poor daughters teacher) BUFFALO WINGS!! (There just is NO better finger food in the world!! :P)This is one of the few films that really does live up to the billing ""PERFECT FOR ALL AGES!""

88,leannawkariuki,Entertaining and Educational,10,20 May 2017,"This Movie was just incredible because it helps children understand the body and your health in a fun way. The live action combined with the animation was very creative and a great way to watch the movie. I know the movie was really successful but if you ever come across with it, you should definitely watch it.Entertaining and extremely educational for kids above the age of 6!",Osmosis Jones
89,videodave,A Rare Germ... err .. Gem,9,5 June 2013,"This is one of those rare gems that gets better and better with each viewing. There are so many in-jokes and subtleties packed into it, that it is impossible to get them all with just one viewing. Each repeat viewing evokes a new and unexpected chuckle or grin. Best viewed on DVD so you can pause and review what you just thought you saw. (Does that sentence make sense?) Although the Live Action parts are rough around the edges. Bill Murray is genius, as always, and the animation scenes are obviously a work of love. The one drawback is Chris Elliot, who, no matter what project he is in, brings the whole production to a crashing bore, due to his complete unlike-ability as an actor and a person.Those who ""get"" this film ""get it"", those who don't, chances are - never will.",Osmosis Jones

91,gwonminseo,Interesting and new,9,31 May 2019,"Osmosis Jones was fresh and educated people who watched it. It was a very smart idea for it being a older movie that was released in 2001. It also had a lesson to educate people about the harms that germs, an unhealthy diet, and lack of exercise can bring. The movie contained educational information, about the human body and what happens in the body when people are sick. The mix animation and the real world going back and forth allows anyone of all ages to enjoy the movie.",Osmosis Jones

It also teach that eating stuff on the ground is very dirty and don't use the 10 second rule!!! After watching this I understand more about how my body function. It was highly for everyone but mostly kid. The movie seem to be very realistic!!! So highly recommended for everyone.,Osmosis Jones

95,ngoctrinh-61034,Out of Date,3,31 May 2019,"Osmosis Jones is definitely an interesting movie, however, personally, I think it is a little out of date on the animation. It is imaginative to have the body work like a city, However, I think it lacks a bit of plot on the real life part of the movie, if that was worked on a little more, I'm sure the movie would be great. Generally, the movie could be better, however, I wouldn't watch it again on my own free time, this can be my personal preference but Osmosis Jones is genuinely a nice movie for past time.",Osmosis Jones

98,sarahnguyenhai,"It is ok, I guess?",5,31 May 2019,It was a good mis between animation and real life acting but the art style and skills could have been better. The really gross scene when the pimple pop was spot on. I'm shock about how real that is. I don't know how they did that.

105,willroby009-1,Neither funny nor educational,2,23 May 2012,"I am a substitute teacher. Middle-school science teachers often leave this movie in lieu of a lesson plan. This is unfortunate because the movie teaches nothing and is also not entertaining.As best I can tell, the producers saw one of those ""Science is COOL!"" posters -- feeble propaganda that fools nobody and embarrasses those who do like science -- and said, ""let's make a movie of it!"" They decked it out with a star-filled cast and plenty of fart/poop/bodily fluid jokes. It never adds up to any more than the poster. But you can look away from a poster. This just keeps going, and going, and going. (And normally I have to show it to FIVE CLASSES).The problem is that no age group will get anything from this movie. It is not engaging or funny enough for teens and adults, and has enough gross jokes to alienate many of the latter. Elementary-school kids might like the animation and goofy/stereotypical story.There is no scientific lesson here. The only lesson is, ""Eat healthy and exercise."" I'm pretty sure we don't need a 90-minute movie to get that across.Teachers, please knock it off already!",Osmosis Jones
106,fuzziness,Embarrassing,2,3 September 2003,"This movie just was not very funny. There's not much else to say, other than that it was kind of embarrassing for Laurence Fishburne and David Hyde Pierce, both of whom deserve much better than this.

107,dsl46016,Very well made movie with an excellent plot idea.,10,3 December 2005,"The plot of the story is extremely well thought of and in hindsight i can understand why it is made by the Farrelly brothers, they have a reputation of making offbeat and skew movies, this one would fall into those categories just from the plot idea.The acting is good, Bill Murray pulls off a very believing father who doesn't give a hoot about germs and disgusting food habits, and therefore his body becomes the host of a very nasty virus named Thrax, and then the movie takes off.For those 90 minutes you will be very entertained and at some times you will close your eyes in disgust while your children will scream and laugh, i wont tell you where these things happen but rest assured, THEY WILL! :)All in all this is a great movie and the voice cast for the main roles fits perfectly, although i have a little trouble with David Hyde Pierce lending his voice to a wannabe-hero-medicine-cold-reliever just from remembering him from Frasier, but after a little while you could not imagine anyone else giving voice.Give this film a chance in the DVD player, you will not be disappointed if you like : Original Plot idea.

It is also very educational with all the body parts and blood and medicine information. It is very good to me because when I grow up, I would like to become a Surgeon. It is also a very funny comedy and can teach viewers to eat good food and to do plenty of exercise. I would recommend watching this excellent movie about cells fighting off a virus in the Human Body. The acting was also very good. The only reason that I gave it a 9 was because Shane (Elena Franklin) looked at the camera when she was on the bus to school camp. But other than that, the movie was humorous, educational and very good.",Osmosis Jones

You can learn a lot about yourself medically speaking as well .,Osmosis Jones

112,john-e,A very entertaining funny family movie,10,7 August 2001,"After reading the latest review posted on this page, I felt it very necessary to clarify a bit about the movie. I also have seen the movie and can tell you that in no way does this movie suck. This movie is in no way meant to be a film.....it is an entertaining family movie. This movie isn't supposed to be anything like reality....as the author in the latest review criticized...it is only meant to entertain. Everyone in this movie is extremely talented and in no way just ""picking up paychecks."" If any person young or old is able to not laugh out loud during Molly Shannon's science fair scene, then they must have no personality whatsoever....Bill Murray is hilarious as usual, and yes, you can sympathise with his character Frank...and young Elena Franklin does a wonderful job as Frank's daughter. This movie is one that both kids and adults will enjoy....as long as it's not taken too seriously. Unlike Disney animation, where the adults can't wait to leave the theatre, this movie has Farrelly brothers humor, so the adults will thoroughly enjoy it. The kids will also love this movie, as its animation is superb and very funny. If you don't come out of this movie smiling, than you have a problem. It's a carefree, entertaining, silly family movie, not meant to be taken as a serious realistic film.",Osmosis Jones

114,caominhmail,Creative but lacking in some areas,7,31 May 2019,"The premise of the movie itself is pretty creative and how they made the human into a city is very imaginative idea. However even though the animated world is well done with good characters and live action world is lacking. The acting is pretty bad for the live action parts though, the acting is over the top and does not make the audience feel things as we cannot relate to how the characters are reacting to the scenarios, The animation aged well as this was a movie made in 2001 however the CGI did not and just comes off as sloppy and gross to the audience. The story over all is a bit cliche as it is just another buddy cop movie but the premise overall made it more enjoyable then an average movie.",Osmosis Jones

117,amyjoyce267,Bloody Good Movie,7,19 August 2007,"I think that this movie was horribly underrated in the UK, and it doesn't get the recognition it deserves. I saw the animated series before the movie, and got interested in watching it, but as I have a phobia of vomit, I was incredibly shocked when I saw Bill Murray throw up all over Molly Shannon with visual and graphic sounds. Still, I plucked up the courage to watch the rest of the movie, which I really enjoyed. However, to this day I have to skip the vomit scene on my DVD. I liked the fact that it was a classic ""cop type"" story, with a baddie, a love interest, a rookie cop and a partnership too. I thought that David Hyde Pierce played the part of Drix brilliantly and Chris Rock was superb as Osmosis. I also like the fact that the movie teaches kids that it's important to take care of yourself.My friend and I still quote ""You gotta get spiffy!"" all the time. I also really loved the soundtrack, I went frantic searching for the CD!",Osmosis Jones
118,ScooterAECOM,What a CLEVER film!,7,11 April 2003,"A lot of people have wondered why this movie tanked.  I think that the problem was that this was marketed as a COMEDY.  I think the movie is really more of an incredibly CLEVER film rather than FUNNY film, with puns and gags, but very few laugh-out-loud jokes.  Think ""Sports Night"" the television series for a perfect analogy (clever and witty and often humorous but not really in a laugh-out-loud manner).   I am a medical student, and I can tell you how clever some of the dialogue/background animation is! The references to physiology and anatomy is really  wonderful!  In this regard, I feel that the movie's flaw is that it can't decide which of these types of movies to be... the Farrely all-out comedy genre (Dumb and Dumber) or the purely clever and witty genre with a touch of heart and humor (Sports Night).  7/10 (it passes)",Osmosis Jones
119,puckrock,my 8 year old loved it,7,13 August 2001,"And so did I.  Clever enough to keep you watching, although bits of the plot were predictable and pedestrian Bill Murray was as usual terrifically watchable, and the cartoon animation was fun.The press reviews have been poor for this one, but as usual they miss the boat when it comes to kid's movies -my 8-1/2 year old daughter loved it, and still talks about it days later.

122,jessie-mc,My View Of Osmosis Jones,10,2 December 2006,I was 8 when I first saw this film and like any kid I loved it. I used to pretend to be Laurence Fishburne's character Thrax. I loved that film for one whole year then got bored of it. Recently this year my computer died and I can only go on my mum's for short periods so at night I had nothing else to do. I started watching different DVD's then at the back of my shelf came across Osmosis Jones. This film I have to say is brilliant it's quite clever at the end with Shayne's Eyelash and the fight between Thrax and Ozzy. This movie is very educational I recently shocked my Science teacher by telling her what a Hypothalamus is. I would recommend this movie to anyone from the age of 10-110. When my brother is old enough I am letting him watch this movie and I hope he will like it as much as I did,Osmosis Jones
123,kshultz,One of the best animated films ever!,9,8 December 2001,"After the disastrous newest addition to the Ferrelly brothers portfolio, Shallow Hal, my faith in them was restored with Osmosis Jones.  This is an absolutely first-rate animated film.The concept is great, combination of live-action and animation, with Bill Murray playing a most disgusting and disheveled character.  But it's the animation which takes place inside his body and the writing that are so good.The cast is first-rate and the humor is very, very funny.  It's completely beyond me why the movie bombed in the theatres and on imdb.  It's enjoyable by kids & adults alike.  There are a few scenes which may be disturbing for young kids, but those aside, it's a winner for the whole family.",Osmosis Jones
124,Wentworthswife,Disgustingly awesome,8,9 June 2007,"I was pleasantly surprised by watching Osmosis Jones. I was expecting a gross-out of poor quality and humour. Okay, some of the lines and scenes were pretty disgusting, like when Frank threw up all over Shane's teacher after eating some rancid shellfish (we've all had that happen) and then the teacher talking about how her kids, Hurley, (whoops - I meant Shirley), and her two little sons, Ralph and Chuck were being constantly teased. And then Frank blew a zit on her face. But the actual content was very educational and my mom just loves the movie. The jokes were tasteful, as tasteful as bodily jokes can preside and the graphics gave an interesting view on how to see your body. Don't watch while eating!",Osmosis Jones
125,chris815-1,Great Movie,9,15 October 2008,"Osmosis Jones is a great movie for all ages. I saw the movie with my little sister and grandmother and we all loved it. It is a comical movie that is funny to everyone. It makes the human body come to life with animating certain body parts and making them come to life as people. They made the germs that entered the body be the bad guys and the cells inside the body be the good guys. This film has stars such as Chris Rock, Laurence Fishburne, Brandy Norwood, William Shatner, Kid Rock, and David Hyde Pierce. These are the main voices of this film. I give this movie a 9 out of 10. I like how when the virus comes into the body they have to send out their cops which are actually white blood cells.",Osmosis Jones
126,Artfreak97,Overall a Great Kids Movie!,6,15 June 2005,"I personally worked on the live action portion of this movie, which was a very cool change from working on commercials! When it was released on DVD, I watched it for the first time with my niece and nephews. They thought it was a cool and new idea for a movie and they really liked the animation. The voices are well-chosen, and the characters are very believable. It's definitely a gross-out movie, and they said ""ewwwww"" in all the right places. This film also sort of indirectly teaches kids that it's important to take care of yourself and your body, which is nice. Made me feel a tad old though because my sisters kids (ages 9, 7, and 6) don't know who Bill Murray is! More a kid's movie than adult, but still mostly enjoyable for adults.",Osmosis Jones
127,Osmosis_Wills,Amazing!,10,22 February 2010,"AMAZING! GREAT! A roller-coaster of emotions. From beginning to end it is an immaculate tale of life, love and action, I don't normally enjoy animated films but this is the Citizen Kane of animation. I have no idea why it did not receive the 8 Oscars it was nominated for. It is a highly under rated film, as was S. Darko the Donnie Darko sequel. As Alvin and the chipmunks would say I want a ""squeekual"". Chris Rock's performance was top notch and it proved that voice acting is a genuine art. It also paved the way for future animations and in my opinion inspired future animations. I hope that future generations will look back and admire this movie and I will be able to say where I was when I first viewed this masterpiece.",Osmosis Jones
128,darthmaul1813,Great movie!,10,4 May 2004,"I really like this movie! I really can't see why this movie got the bad ratings and reviews it did. Sure, it was gross on a lot of the parts and it's not THE funniest movie ever, but it was still good. The animation was awesome and the acting was really good. I didn't catch this movie in theaters, so I wouldn't know if people were gagging in the theaters, but I did gag on some parts. I like gross stuff though and maybe that's why I liked it. Some people, like my mom, can't take stuff like that. She turned the movie off 15 minutes into it. But I don't know why people think this movie is bad for the younger kids. My cousin watched it when she was four and loved it, but of course this is my cousin we're talking about. She likes to act like an adult. She did love it though. Anyway, it's a great, but under-rated movie.",Osmosis Jones
129,pmgc-1,Whole is way less than sum of parts,1,12 June 2004,"Great concept, perfect characterizations and voices, but a complete waste of time. A real shame since had it aimed higher, it would probably not have been the bomb it was (is); way too dependent upon scatological humor, for starters. I'm amazed by comments from ""educated"" reviewers referring to the ""good science"" behind this piece of puerile trash. Unlike ""Finding Nemo,"" where (with a bit of suspension of disbelief) attention to detail was staggering and the science was as good as the context would allow, ""Osmosis Jones"" was utter nonsense; don't kid yourself about the science.

PROS: -Creative Premise and Environment (some of the body part/city comparisons were brilliant) -Good Comedy(includes several HILARIOUS Sight Gags.) -Cool Villain -Decent Animation CONS: -The Parts with Bill Murray on camera can sometimes drag a touch. -(this is the big one) The plot brings nothing new to the table. It is a by-the-numbers buddy cop movie, and we all know what's going to go down. So, don't come into this film expecting a new story.

I love Chris Rock, Lawrence Fishburn (voices for Ozzy and Thrax) in this movie. I do see that this movie would be good for younger kids and older ones. (if they would just agree to watch it; people judge things too quickly.) I think this movie was awesome and I first watched it when I recorded it on my DVR when it came on TBS one night. Unfortunately,my parents erased the recording. (and believe me,I WAS MAD AS HECK!) I hope to catch it again on TV but right now I think that would rarely happen. :( Well any way. PLZ WATCH THIS MOVIE AND DON'T FORGET TO SUBMIT STUFF ON THE LITTLE GRAY REVIEW BOX AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE!!!",Osmosis Jones
