0,SnoopyStyle,too melodramatic and so much yelling,5,26 January 2015,"In Chicago, John Quincy Archibald (Denzel Washington) and wife Denise (Kimberly Elise) are struggling financially. Their son Mike collapses at the baseball game. Rebecca Payne (Anne Heche) is the hospital president and Dr. Raymond Turner (James Woods) is their cardiac surgeon. Mike needs a heart transplant but the HMO won't cover the minimum $250k. They can't get any help no matter how hard they try. In desperation, an armed John takes over the emergency room. Police Lt. Frank Grimes (Robert Duvall) negotiates with him.It's an over-the-edge melodrama. The problem is that everything is pushed to the edge. Denzel is crying in the first 15 minutes. I appreciate the message but it's lost in the montage of frustration. Denzel is pushing so hard to be hyper angry that it's difficult to root for him. If Denzel and Kimberly could calm down early on, the audience could embrace them. In fact, everybody seems to be yelling in this movie. It's a hard movie to like.",John Q
1,lee_eisenberg,"An important issue, although they got a number of things wrong.",7,16 March 2006,"""John Q"" was the first movie with which I'm familiar that looked at the health care situation in this country. Too bad that it had so many inaccuracies. The plot of course has economically strapped John Quincy Archibald (Denzel Washington) taking a hospital hostage to demand medical treatment for his son.But, like I said, they misrepresented a number of things too many to enumerate here. But this movie's strength is looking at the disastrous effects of letting insurance companies run our health care system. You just may want to move to Canada after seeing this (although I haven't moved there). Also starring Kimberly Elise, James Woods, Anne Heche, Robert Duvall, and Ray Liotta.",John Q
2,jboothmillard,John Q,6,4 June 2009,"From director Nick Cassavetes (The Notebook), I think the lead actor was the most appealing and obvious reason to see the film, with some other good people too. Basically Michael 'Mike' Archibald (Daniel E. Smith), son of John Quincy Archibald (Denzel Washington), collapses during a baseball game as a result of heart failure. Then John and his wife Denise (Kimberly Elise) find out that Mike needs a heart transplant or he will die, but unfortunately, they don't have the $250,000 for the operation, and their insurance won't cover it. Out of options to raise cash quickly, John ""Q"" takes a gun into the hospital and holds everyone, staff and patients, hostage until the doctors agree to put Mike on the transplant list. Soon the police show up outside, led by Lt. Frank Grimes (Robert Duvall) and Chief Gus Monroe (Ray Liotta), and their only communication with John is through the phone, negotiating for hostages to be released, but John is not leaving until they have found a heart for his son. There is a point where John is desperate for his son to live and he is willing to sacrifice himself, but thankfully, a recently dead person with the right blood type and heart size is found just in time. In the end, Mike's life is saved with a new heart, and John is found guilty of only one of three charges. Also starring James Woods as Dr. Raymond Turner, Anne Heche as Rebecca Payne, Eddie Griffin as Lester Matthews, Shawn Hatosy as Mitch Quigley, Laura Elena Harring as Gina Palumbo, Ted Demme as Himself and My Name Is Earl's Ethan Suplee as Guard Max Conlin. Washington of course plays a powerful role, the supporting cast all do very well also, it is a very watchable gripping near action drama. Good!",John Q
3,rmax304823,Have a Heart!,6,19 March 2007,"Denzel Washington is a hard-working blue collar father whose son needs a heart transplant but who has run out of money and can't afford further medical treatment. He impulsively takes over Hope Memoral Hospital in Chicago, calling himself ""John Q."" (as in ""John Q. Public""), holds the minimal weekend staff hostage and demands that his son be put on the list of recipients for a donated heart by a doctor (Anne Heche). Outside, the police (Robert Duvall and Ray Liotta) surround the place, a thousand guns aimed at the hospital, and try variously to negotiate with him or to snipe him. No donor being available, Washington decides that since he and his son have been tissue-typed and match, Washington will blow his own brains out to provide the necessary heart. Lots of arguments follow, involving chiefly one of the hostages who happens to be a cardiac surgeon (James Woods). As in a miracle, a young woman with a matching heart dies and the donation comes through just as Washington is wrestling with the damned safety on the automatic he's holding to his head. Whew! A close call, I'd say.Well, it has a truly competent professional cast, no doubt about it, and they play it at par. Also quite good in a small role is Paul Johansson. Nick Cassavetes' direction is functional but no more than that.The movie's up against the wall though. Inevitably we're dealing with de Maupassant's ""Boule de Souif,"" in which a small group of people of varying tastes and backgrounds are squeezed together under pressure and little dramas play out between them. In a case like this the success depends as much on the script as on anything else. Given that it's going to look a little mechanical, and given that none if any of the characters can be given full development, whether the film satisfies or not hangs on what the characters say.""Stagecoach"" did a fine job, and so did ""Twelve Angry Men"" and ""Dog Day Afternoon,"" so it's not an impossible task. The characters here are mostly predictably stereotyped. Among the police, we have the negotiator in conflict with the exterminator. We have conflict within the hospital between the pragmatist doctor and the humanist doctor. Among the waiting-room patients we have the noble black couple about to have their first child and the cowardly slapaho sniveling braggart of a white guy. The police sniper is fat, sweaty, sneering, and ugly.And they pretty much stay the way they are. There is a good deal of preaching that goes on. HMOs come in for a good deal of abuse. We know immediately that the chief of police, Liotta, is a simple-minded goon because he shows up at the ""hostage situation"" in full uniform, dripping with decorations, shaking hands with the press, telling everyone what to do because he knows best -- ""How do you think I got THESE?"", he shouts at Duvall's negotiator, pointing to the four stars on his shoulder. Oh -- the press. I forgot about the press. I leave it up to you to guess whether the model presented to us is the same as that in the ""Die Hard"" films (get the scoop at all costs, and make sure my hair looks good) or the idealistic responsible model the fifth estate would like us to swear to. The film overall takes a worthwhile story about a social issue and turns it into and almost unbroken string of sentimental clichés. There are some good things going for the film, despite the weaknesses of the script. A few exchanges stand out. As in ""Dog Day Afternoon,"" when the crowd cheers Al Pacino, there is a crowd here that goes wild with applause when Denzel Washington appears at the hospital door. But Duvall puts it in perspective. ""You're just the cause for today. Tomorrow you'll be forgotten."" Anne Heche, the hard-boiled doctor, is given a good line too. If we give in to Washington's demands today, tomorrow the hospitals will be filled with gun-toting loonies. Why is it a good line, when nothing more is made of it? Because although it sounds like common sense there is not the slightest evidence that it's true. Our values are filled with such axioms. We never negotiate with terrorists. We only negotiate from a position of strength. Give 'em an inch and they'll take a mile. Skinnerian reenforcement works well with puppies and rats under controlled conditions. But does it work outside the lab? Probably, in a general way, but what's really at stake when we refuse negotiation -- reenforcement or our own pride? Should life and death depend on a notion so simple that it can be put on a bumper sticker? The film isn't entirely original or gripping, despite the tension inherent in the situation, but I'd be willing to rate it above average if it just makes us think a little more about that primitive belief.It's necessary to add that this is not a partisan liberal tract. The economics of HMOs is briefly and cogently explained and they come out looking bad. Not because they're evil but because that's the way health plans were structured. They were a social problem years before they became a political issue.",John Q
4,Quinoa1984,A downer from son of John (I mean the director),5,15 February 2002,"I'm surprised at Nick Cassavettes, son of John (""Shadows"" comes to mind), who has made a film here that contains some note-worthy elements including fine acting from some of the cast, a great scene during the opening credits, and a good premise.  But the execution is something that started to really grate at me by the time the movie ended.  Washington is believable as a John Q. who's son's heart needs to be transplanted, and doesn't have the insurance to cover it.  Up until the main chunk of the film started to roll with John taking an emergency room full of conventional characters hostage with the also conventional cop characters on the outset, it seemed like a good idea for a movie by examining how insurance companies (as well as doctors and hospitals) screw over people in need.  But no, the film plunges instead into scenes that tried way too hard to try and pull at the heart strings of the audience and I'm sure I wasn't the only one not so moved by the decisions and moves by the central characters.In other words, there are a few tolerable moments of cinema squared into John Q., but it isn't worth sitting through all the drek that goes with it (maybe switch on and off from it when it comes on cable). C-",John Q
5,michaelRokeefe,It is hard to keep a good man down.,6,19 January 2003,Nick Cassavetes directs this pressure cooker. Tension filled drama that will tug at your heart strings. A desperate man(Denzel Washington)takes a hospital ER hostage when his HMO refuses to cover the bill for his son's heart-transplant. A very good cast and a time relevant story. Washington this time is the flip side of the coin compared to his role in TRAINING DAY(2001). Washington as John Q. is a sensitive family man ready to give his life for his son's. James Woods is the ER doc among the hostages. Anne Heche plays a bitch of a business controller standing in the way of the life saving operation...but then changes attitude. Also in the cast are Robert Duvall and Ray Liotta as law officials with different opinions of the stand off situation. The little boy with the bad heart is played fervently by Daniel F. Smith. JOHN Q. is a don't miss that is straight on passion.,John Q
6,hitchcockthelegend,Preachy or poignant?.,7,15 October 2008,"During a baseball game, John Quincy Archibald's son Michael collapses and is diagnosed as having a major heart defect that requires a transplant ASAP. Sadly John and his wife, Denise, don't have enough insurance to cover the cost of such an operation, no matter what they do they just can't come up with enough cash to save Michael's life. Desperate and angry at the money laden red tape, John takes the ER room hostage and demands that the transplant be done.Coming as i do from Great Britain, i have no bond of feeling to the thought of having to pay for medical insurance, so with that in mind i viewed John Q from the off with a certain degree of interest. Just scanning through some of the user comments here it's apparent that this is a most divisive picture amongst the American users, no great deal of middle ground, it's either preachy nonsense trying to make a moral stance, or it's a highly involving picture tenderly bringing to light a serious issue.My thoughts are quite simply that as a drama it works considerably well, the issue at hand makes for a compelling picture, and even allowing for an overkilling of sentimental strands, it's intelligent and never less than interesting. However the constant stream of formulaic characters hinders the film and stops it totally achieving its aims, to anyone who hasn't seen this picture i would wager that if i asked you to pick ten characters for a hostage piece, you would get nine of them right. It's a real shame because John Q is a fine film in substance, and is backed up by a competent cast list, even if not all of them are quite utilised to the maximum.Taking the lead as John Q is Denzel Washington, few actors of his generation can give so much emotion into a character, it's a great turn from him and one that deserves far more credit that it gets. Robert Duvall and James Woods have critical roles but not given enough meat to really get their respective teeth into, Ray Liotta is safe and enjoyable in an annoying role, whilst Kimberly Elise {as mother Denise} and Anne Heche {the cold hearted hospital administrator} are merely making up the numbers. A bit more bravery and a bit less sentiment may well have lifted John Q into one of this decades best dramas category, as it is it's a missed opportunity that still delivers enough punch for this particular viewer to give it the thumbs up. 7/10",John Q
7,lastliberal,"I get it, you a member of the Slapaho Tribe.",8,22 June 2007,"Without reservation, I can recommend that any Denzel Washington film is worth your time, and that most will be memorable experiences. OK, maybe not License to Kill.This film is certainly topical with Michael Moore's Sicko opening this weekend. It is about a father, with insurance, trying to get treatment for his son and the uncaring health care industry. This film is trying to get the same message across by using tense drama to make it's point.James Woods (Ghosts of Mississippi, Salvador) is incredible as the surgeon that is obsessed with money. Anne Heche (Six Days Seven Nights, Girls in Prison) is also great as the seemingly uncaring hospital administrator. Ray Liotta (Copland, Goodfellas) and Robert Duvall (The Godfather) also put in good performances. Those who checked out Nancy Drew will recognize Laura Harring, and those who saw The Notebook will recognize David Thornton. They play a couple that definitely provide some interesting entertainment during the siege of the ER. There are cameos from a lot of real people like Jay Leno and Bill Maher.If you ever had trouble with your health insurance company, you will like John Q. If you like Denzel, you will love John Q. His performance her is comparable to Pacino in Dog Day Afternoon. Just see it, and then go see Sicko.",John Q
8,view_and_review,Spellbinding,9,4 February 2021,"The first movie I ever saw regarding our healthcare system that impacted me was ""Article 99"" with Ray Liotta, Kiefer Sutherland, Forest Whitaker, Lea Thompson, John C. McGinley, John Mahoney, Keith David, and Kathy Baker. It dealt specifically with military veterans and their inability to get adequate healthcare. It was a dramedy that was well done.""John Q"" blows that movie out of the water.""John Q"" was the lone Denzel film that I'd been pining to see but never found the chance. I knew that it was a heavy topic and it wasn't something I could readily and easily watch. Some movies you have to be in the mood for, whereas other movies you can plop down and watch at any time. ""John Q"" is not a plop-down movie.John Quincy Archibald (Denzel Washington) was a regular, blue collar, working stiff. Due to cutbacks at his job of 15 years, he was down to 20 hours a week of work. It wasn't nearly enough to take care of all the bills and we were made painfully aware of that when his wife's car was repoed.After his young son Mike (Daniel E. Smith) collapsed on the baseball field John found out just how little money he had. Mike had an enlarged and weak heart that would cost $250,000 to replace IF he could get a donor. Since John didn't have adequate healthcare coverage, the hospital considered him a cash account, which meant he'd have to fork over $75,000 just to get his son's name on a donor list.John did any and everything to raise money to save his son who only had weeks, if not days, to live. When the hospital said they were going to release Mike, which was tantamount to saying ""If he dies, he dies,"" John decided to take matters into his own hands. He went to the hospital, gave the heart surgeon Dr. Raymond Turner (James Woods) one more chance and then began taking hostages. It was a desperate move that could end very badly, but a desperate father will do just about anything to save his child.This movie was gripping, poignant, and had some magnificent performances. Denzel's performance was Oscar worthy, but I could say that about a dozen of his performances. James Woods as the rich cardiovascular surgeon was very much classic James Woods--smug. Robert Duvall pretty much reprised his role from ""Falling Down"" where he was the understanding cop. In ""John Q"" he is the understanding hostage negotiator. I think everyone in this splendid film deserved a round of applause.""John Q"" attacked a real problem in a gutsy and intelligent fashion without being didactic or preachy. For many, healthcare wasn't a thought on their mind until this movie, or until ""Sicko,"" or until Obamacare was rolled out. Unfortunately for tens of millions of other Americans, healthcare had been an issue well before movies such as ""John Q."" This riveting movie drove the point home like nothing I've seen. It was spellbinding.",John Q
9,movieman_kev,Unwatchable,2,10 May 2004,"Denzel Washington takes on the MEAN medical system & EVIL doctors and SATANIC HMO's.Horribly slanted propaganda, does NOT a good movie make. And to add insult to injury, towards the end they even have the sheer audacity to have a clip of Hillary Clinton!! If the medical bill she sponsered back then HAD come to past, it could very might well have made America, land of the free into America, socialist country. The invention of HMO's was caused by the government, and the makers of this film want to give MORE control to said government?? I'm sorry this movie is total crap.Where i saw it: HBOMy Grade: F",John Q
10,Wuchakk,Desperate people do desperate things,7,30 June 2017,"Released in 2002 and directed by Nick Cassavetes, ""John Q"" stars Denzel Washington in the title role as a factory worker in the Chicago area whose son desperately needs a heart transplant, but the biyatch at the hospital maintains that he doesn't have enough coverage (Anne Heche). John feels he has no choice but to take radical measures to save his son, even if it costs his life. James Woods plays the main doctor while Robert Duvall & Ray Liotta appear as the top officers. Kimberly Elise is on hand as John's wife while David Thornton & Laura Harring play the couple's best friends.The movie effectively shows how effed up the American health care system is and appears to promote universal health care. While the system obviously needs fixed, Nobamacare wasn't the way to do it; and, in many ways, made things worse. Nobamacare didn't even accomplish it's supposed goal, which was to grant health care to ALL Americans, at least that's what the 'powers that be' maintained; as of this writing there are still 27 million citizens who are uninsured, and probably far more than that. In reality Nobamacare was basically a Demoncrap Federal power grab.But all that is irrelevant to whether or not the movie is effective, which it is. It's not believable, but it's certainly entertaining. What do I mean by not being believable? The tone is generally realistic, but the characters and dramatics are so amped up the movie is sometimes almost a parody (almost). A good example is how over-the-top uncaring Heche's character is compared to the low-key evil of Nurse Ratched in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (1975). The histrionics amongst the hostages is another prime example.Speaking of the hostages, at around the 40-minute mark the movie settles into a confined-location flick. These kinds of stories involve several characters, usually strangers, who are stuck in a particular environment wherein they are forced to get to know each other and interact in order to survive (2007's ""The Mist"" is a good example). The producers assembled a notable cast for this stock plot (Eddie Griffin, Shawn Hatosy, Heather Wahlquist, Troy Winbush, Ethan Suplee and a few others, including Woods) with Griffin, Hatosy, Winbush and Wahlquist standing out. The latter, incidentally, has a great ""Whoa Mama!"" scene.The opening scenes seem somewhat contrived, but the movie quickly finds its footing and compellingly embroils you in the events until the close, despite the aforementioned overblown moments. Of course, Washington is excellent as the likable protagonist turned antihero. You can't help but sympathize with him even though what he does is very foolish. Bold, yes, but foolish.The movie run 116 minutes and was shot in Ontario (Solina, Cambridge, Ajax, Hamilton, Oshawa & Toronto) and Montreal with the mountain scenes shot in Alberta (Canmore & Cochrane) and establishing shots in Chicago.

11,Sylviastel,Long Overdue!,7,17 January 2008,"It's no secret that America has a health care crisis where about 50 million people are uninsured in this country. The story about John Q. is about his battle to save his son's life when the hospital and health insurance companies have failed his young son by declining to put his name on the heart transplant list. Two time Oscar Winner Denzel Washington does his best to bring life into this character that any other actor would not be able to do. Kimberly Elise is also admirable in her role as his wife. Anne Heche's performance as Rebecca Payne, the hospital administrator, is quite sickening because she plays the bureaucracy part of the role but she does it well. She can act as well. James Woods plays the rich, blood-sucking doctor who John Q. takes hostage along with other innocent bystanders and hospital staff but John Q. has a heart too. Ray Liotta and Robert Duvall have supporting roles as the police chief and hostage negotiator trying to get John Q. to end the standoff. The actions are understandable since a parent would do anything to save their child's life from known death.",John Q
12,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: (DVD) John Q (2002),7,15 January 2006,"John Q is your everyday man, the blue collar worker with lots of debts to pay. The kind in which Banks don't hesitate to send the repo man over for a default non payment. The kind whose up late at night trying to work out his sums and play it right. In short, a typical average family person with typical family problems.However, things turn for the worse when his only child Mike requires an urgent heart transplant to save his life. Sure, not that hearts are easy to come by (trust Hollywood to make it within an hour or so), but the bottom line is, John has no money to pay for the whopping 250,000 dollars surgery.Which brings us to something real - medical costs, wherever you are, is always spiralling upwards. While hospitals and their doctors make millions, how many are willing (or able to?) work around the administration to perform a life-saving operation, for free, or a nominal sum. Don't get me wrong, it's difficult to be ""free"", because everyone will take; it's human tendency. But it does raise some questions as you sit through this movie.Ah, the insurance companies get another stab at being unscrupulous as well. Downgrading and changing John's policy without his knowledge, isn't really ethical. But it's always about business, and with businesses, it's again about the bottom line. John Q tries all avenues to raise funds, and gets caught in red tape aplenty.So when faced with a wall behind his back, John Q finally snaps and decides to take matters into his own hands. By holding a host of characters - the surgeon (James Woods), a security guard, a pregnant woman, a rich yuppie couple, etc, while being made into the local hero by the media, and those who had enough of red tape. It's somewhat satisfying to watch on screen how favors are swung his way, and how incredibly lucky he can get, as John negotiates with Police Negotiator Frank, played by veteran Robert Duvall.It's compelling drama, by Denzel Washington no less. Completing the cast are Ray Liotta as the police chief who screws up a rescue attempt, and Anne Heche as the uncompromising, cold hospital administrator. But towards the end it degenerates into typical Hollywood fare - entertaining, but lacking serious punch to make a statement on topics it highlighted in the first act.Barebones Code 3 DVD with no extras.",John Q
13,namashi_1,Denzel Washington Rocks!,6,2 May 2011,"Denzel Wasington Rocks! And this fact, is once again proved, with his terrific act in 'John Q'. Though a decent film, it's flaws come up evidently, but Denzel manages to hold you till the end.Denzel stars as John Quincy Archibald, a father and husband whose son is diagnosed with an enlarged heart and then finds out he cannot receive a transplant because HMO insurance will not cover it. Therefore, he decides to take a hospital full of patients hostage until the hospital puts his son's name on the recipient's list.The Idea is interesting & challenging. The film begins with a class, as the writing holds you. But, in the second hour, especially, the writing gets lose and even the culmination isn't as good as one expects it to be. Nick Cassavetes directs this emotional story, with patience. Cinematography & Editing are fine. Acting-Wise: As mentioned right from the beginning, Denzel rules the show. A performance so well-done, that it holds you, even when the writing falters. In the supporting cast, Bobby Duvall, James Woods & Kimberly Elise are efficient. Anne Heche & Ray Liotta are passable. Others lend support. On the whole, 'John Q' is interesting in parts, but what really stands tall in this film, is it's lead-star's performance.",John Q
14,=G=,Good ol' fashioned no-brainer popcorn flick,6,17 July 2002,"Washington takes on the establishment as the title character of ""John Q."", a too-good-to-be-true dad with a son in need of a new heart and an HMO who's denying the operation because of poor insurance benefits. A good old fashioned escapist drama, John Q. takes a hospital hostage and we get to vicariously relish in watching snotty administrators, a smartass top cop, and even a wife beater brought to their knees by one man with a gun. A well balanced film which is admittedly transparent, ""John Q. conjures up ample entertainment for the masses by kicking the butts of all the things we love to hate except the IRS and film critics.  B-",John Q
15,MovieAddict2016,Lived up to my expectations and beyond!,8,18 July 2002,"When John Q came out in theaters I wanted to see it. I had seen a trailer in LOTR for it, and when it came out it got some good reviews. I ended up waiting for it on DVD, and last night I finally saw it. It lived up to everything I thought. Although the film itself might not be Oscar material, Denzel Washington could've been nominated for an oscar for THIS role, instead of Training Day(which I haven't seen yet, but heard he actually wasn't as good in that film as John Q). His emotions play out on the screen, as do the tension between Robert Duvall's character Grimes, a hostage negotiator, and Ray Liota's character, the chief of police. When it all comes down to it, John Q delievers, and with some comedy relief a few times by Eddie Griffin, whom is a hostage, and John Q's friend who's always saying ""'friggin,"" it also has some ""relief points"" in the film from the constant drama. Though some critics and moviegoers might think it's unrealistic how the hostages pretty much talk freely, they all know that John Q isn't going to kill them, because as the movie shouts at people, everyone who meets him realizes John Q wouldn't hurt a fly. This movie's worth the rental. Pick it up, you won't be let down.",John Q
16,sddavis63,Truly Disappointing,2,12 October 2002,"This must surely rank as one of Denzel Washington's weakest movies ever. Pretty much everything else he's done I have enjoyed immensely and so I rented this expecting something of high calibre. What I got instead was a silly movie with silly performances and a silly storyline that didn't really make much sense.Washington is John Q. Archibald,  a down on his luck factory worker whose son desperately needs a heart transplant that the hospital refuses to give him because of insufficient medical coverage. Frantic to get his son the attention he needs, Archibald takes the emergency room hostage, demanding that his son be ""put on the list.""Let me say first that I agree with the political viewpoint of the movie. Having said that, if I wanted a debate on the merits of public vs. private health care I'd listen to politicians debate the issue. I don't watch a movie to hear a campaign speech, and yet this movie sounds like one long campaign speech (Sen. Hilary Clinton even appears speaking to the issue.) It really did get to be too much. At one point the hostages in the emergency room start to debate the issue! One would think that they might have had other things on their minds - like whether they'd ever see their families again! Performances ranged from barely acceptable (Washington) to silly (Paul Johansson as a truly irritating TV news reporter, Robert Duvall as the police negotiator who seems to be having a great time during this whole thing and Ray Liotta as the basically weak and incompetent police chief) to just downright bad casting (Ann Heche as the tough as nails heartless hospital administrator?!) And the story? Well, one of the police officers explained the basic problem best. John Q is holding the hostages until his son is ""put on the list."" Well - why not just tell him his son is on the list? Seems to me it would have solved a lot of the problems. I guess that's why I'm not a screen writer. I think scripts should make at least some sense.Honestly - it's just a bad movie. The first bad movie I think I've ever seen Denzel Washington in. Well, even Joe DiMaggio's hitting streak came to an end.2/10",John Q

20,Dr_Coulardeau,Health coverage in the US is really sick,10,14 August 2007,"This film is the pioneer and precursor of Michael More's documentary Sicko recently released, but this one is based on a fictional situation. What is a father ready to do to enable his son to get a heart transplant? And what is the system able to do to prevent him from getting it because he does not have enough insurance coverage? The second question is easy to answer: nothing and the system will let the child die. No insurance coverage, no treatment. The first question is a lot more difficult to answer; the film goes very far in the fiction and yet it is absolutely believable. Yes a father is able to kidnap innocent people and medical personnel to impose a positive solution. Then the rest is pure luck, haphazard chance, good effective media, a lot of human feeling, a mistake done by the shoot-first-ask-questions-second chief of police in his four star uniform, and of course a lot of sympathy from the public which is perfectly understandable when you know 46 millions Americans have no health coverage at all and probably twenty more millions have a partial coverage, i.e. not full coverage or full coverage not all the time. The film is of course very effective emotionally, and it uses some short sequences from the news programs of the 1990s when Hillary Clinton was trying in the name of her husband to convince Congress to pass legislation on the subject and failed. I think even to kill yourself to provide your own son with a heart is an option that could be considered by some fathers. Of course the film did not emphasize the real negative sides of the problem, the greediness of some doctors, the total indifference of most administrative personnel, the brutality of the police in such cases who would consider a forceful solution before a peaceful one. But there must be some dream even when dealing with such a subject.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",John Q
21,zkonedog,A Nuanced Film With A Perfect Cast,9,6 March 2017,"When crafting a film like ""John Q."", it would have been simple for director Nick Cassavetes to go the ""simple route"" and turn it into a simple hostage flick. Luckily for viewers, though, Cassavetes instead creates an incredibly nuanced movie that is casted about as perfectly as any film ever made.For a basic plot summary, ""John Q."" tells the story of John Archibald (Denzel Washington) and wife Denise (Kimberly Elise), who see their son Mikey (Daniel E. Smith) collapse at a Little League and require a new heart to live for much longer. The problem? The Archibalds do not have good enough insurance to cover the procedure, leading John to take matters into his own hands.This is one of my favorite movies of all-time because of its many nuances. The themes are very thought-provoking and very ""grey""...no ""black and white"" heroes and villains here. As in real life, there are always other agendas that must be pieced together and reckoned with in order to understand any situation. The same goes for this movie. Is John the hero or the villain? It all depends on how you look at it. I love (and respect) films that are able to both entertain me and make me think about how the events on the screen relate to my own life.It only helps that this is perhaps the most perfectly-casted film in cinema history! Denzel is, of course, custom-made for his role, while auxiliary players like James Woods, Anne Heche, Ray Liotta, & Robert Duvall couldn't be better in the roles they play.Overall, ""John Q."" is a film that may just speak to you on a number of different levels (societal, personal, etc.). It also contains enough drama, action, and humor to be a well-rounded experience. If you are a fan of Denzel's work at all, or even just movies that will make you think, then this one should not be missed.",John Q
22,TheMovieDiorama,John Q. injects a dosage of exaggerated thrills into a medical commentary.,6,26 April 2019,"America's healthcare system has been one economic infrastructure that challenges many individuals, although to be honest, most nations face the same criticism of dissatisfaction. This medical thriller attempts to comment on the current disadvantages of such a economy that relies on low taxes but extensive and overly complicated insurances which may not be entirely accessible to everyone, particularly those less fortunate. As entertainment, it works. As realism, not so much. However the good intentions of its premise is enough to garner some enjoyment. A father is driven to desperation when his son unexpectedly requires a heart donor in order to survive, but lacks the funds and insurance to provide one.The hospital staff apparently want nothing to do with you if you have insufficient funds for such an expensive procedure. ""I advise you to embrace your son and spend his last days together in comfort"". Really? The hyperbolic uselessness of these institutions is utilised to provide the story with a theoretical antagonist and a motive for the titular father. A man driven by desperation to do literally anything and everything to save his son. A consistently engaging character that comes to life thanks to Washington's electric central performance. The man can act. Fact. He can turn the most over-the-top plots (hint: this film) and pull off an award winning performance.The first half of the narrative was excellent. Realistic dilemmas divulging into financial difficulties and moral implications. The dialogue between Washington and Elise gave them personable and inspiration qualities as they sell everything. Then we get to the heart of the plot (pun intended), an unfocused hostage situation, to which the emotional trauma and subtle statement is substituted for generic enjoyment. Far too outlandish to be convincing, yet well-intentioned. Harshly rated by critics in my opinion, could've been far more emotionally manipulative but Washington brings the goods as usual and attempts to make the hearty drama grounded.",John Q

Denzel looses his mind and takes hostages at the hospital and demands the lifesaving surgery for his son.The good: Great start of the story (7 - 8 stars) and a subject about the dangers of having health insurance in America, that is worth telling.The bad: towards the end the story becomes quite unbelievable and extremely sugarcoated until it makes me cringe with disbelief and repulsion about all the sentimental feelgood scenes.",John Q
24,videorama-759-859391,Dog Day Afternoon in a hospital,8,31 March 2015,"This movie has you from beginning to end, well acted by everything, little or big a role. If one film has really taken a bad rap, it would be this one, where to be honest, I found myself questioning why in an enigmatic way like if by the big Q in the film's title. It has everything going for it, and an all too real situation, I guess many people in hardship, will painfully relate to. It's the story of a good man, John Q (Washington) forced to take it upon himself, to go outside the law, to save his son, by any means possible. Washington, in a real human and believable performance, who doesn't overact, can't come up with the mooloh, to get his son on the waiting list for a new donor, where time is very short. When coming up again many brick walls, where to me, this reality was frightening, he ends up taking over the hospital, forcing the doctors to perform an operation, otherwise he'll start taking casualties. I must admit, I really love this film, the different setting on a hostage scenario, I liked very much. Ann Heche, an actress who can really surprise you, is quite a standout here as the hospital's money grabbing governor who's not willing to take John's word, that he'll reimburse her with the money. Let's face it, if everyone did that, there's no guarantee everybody would pay. It was just Heche's lack of compassion to her character at the start, which I must admit, I really didn't like. Woods as a top surgeon siding with Heche, kind of had the same affect, and my opinion of his character, finely played by the great actor, didn't really improve, except for up near the end, with John making one crazy decision, to end one life to save another. I hadn't seen a film, I enjoyed so much as this for a while, where it was richly entertaining, with even a believable ending, though the script wasn't the best, and a little ordinary at times, but this is one of those films you must see, and rule out the bad hype beforehand. The race against time climax was quite gripping for those few minutes, and the last father and son chat, an endearing, moving, and unforgettable scene.",John Q
25,dee.reid,A very good film that touches up on highly debatable subject matter,10,24 July 2002,"""John Q"" stars Denzel Washington in the title role as a desperate father who takes a hospital emergency room hostage when he discovers that he can't pay for his son's heart transplant.  You see John's situation is a lot more complicated than that.  First off, the creditors have re-possessed one of his cars, he himself is unable to make ends meet with his family, and to make matters worse, the insurance company refuses to pay for the transplant. So what is John Q. going to do?  Anything he can, even if it means putting his own life on the line.This is a truly memorable film that is definitely Oscar-worthy.  Denzel Washington gives another performance worthy of an Oscar.  The supporting cast which includes Robert Duvall, James Woods, Anne Heche, Kimberly Elise, and Ray Liotta, is good as well.  I really like the villain here, which is not Denzel's character nor James' character, but our own health care system, which says that if you don't have any money, then we can't help you.  Where does it say in our constitution that a price could ever be put on a human life?  The answer: no where in it, as far as I can see.  10/10",John Q
26,mattkratz,outstanding,8,20 March 2013,"This is a movie that draws out the phrase, ""desperate times call for desperate measures."" Washington plays a guy whose son collapses during a little game of a heart condition and needs a serious operation and, when his insurance won't cover it, takes everyone in the emergency room hostage till he can work something out. Robert Duvall plays the hostage negotiator. They work beautifully together. The kid was good in it too. I think this was a good movie, and Washington was terrific, as always. My favorite line:when asked if anyone is hurt, Washington says, ""It's an emergency room. They're all hurt."" The cast works well together, and it builds up steam & suspense well. A good way to spend a few hours watching a movie.** 1/2 out of ****",John Q
27,juneebuggy,"Great cast, great story, solid movie",7,26 October 2015,"This was good, carried for the most part by Denzel Washington who (as always) puts on a great performance. It's one of those movies that will have you cheering for the ""bad guy"" and also questioning how far you would go for those you love? It also brings into play media exploitation, the American health care system and the lack of rights for the average blue collar worker.I was definitely invested in this story which felt unique and found myself frustrated alongside John and his lack of options. Denzel plays John Q Archibald, a family man whose son needs a lifesaving heart operation. When his health plan doesn't cover the medical procedure and after exhausting all avenues John snaps and takes drastic steps.What I enjoyed most about this movie was probably the interaction between 'John' and the hostages which takes up a considerable amount of the story and are played by some (now) very recognizable faces including Ethan Suplee, Kevin Connolly, Eddie Griffin and Shawn Hatosy.We also have James Woods as a conceited surgeon, Robert Duvall and Ray Liotta in police roles and wow Anne Heche, what a b!tch as the hospital coordinator.The ending was bit too melodramatic but all in a decent movie. 10/11/15",John Q
28,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,Excellent thriller that'll have you glued to your seat from start to finish,10,21 November 2005,"JOHN Q, in my opinion, is an excellent thriller that'll have you glued to your seat from start to finish. It sort of reminds me of THE NEGOTIATOR, only this movie mostly takes place in a hospital. I really loved John (Denzel Washington). This is because he wouldn't give up hope for his son (Daniel E. Smith). If I were him, I'd do something desperate, but not illegal. Grimes (Robert Duvall) made me feel good, too. It's hard for me to explain why. Now, in conclusion, I recommend this excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat action movie that have you glued to your seat from start to finish to all you Denzel Washington or Robert Duvall fans who haven't seen it. When you see this movie, hold on tight and prepare to be taken on a wild ride. I also guarantee you you'll want to see it over and over again.",John Q

Of course, we don't get to see his final moments for cheap ""mystery"". But a few moments later, we see that he's fine. They did not even try to make it convincing that he could've actually suicided.

30,Agent10,Riveting take on the state of medical coverage,7,20 May 2002,"-contains spoilers-To a lesser extent, this film is like a modern version of Sally Mae, a film about the everyday individual that moves to extremes to get what they feel is fair. While John Q is not as well put together, Denzel Washington stopped playing his soul brother routine and portrayed a man who felt lost in a world of red tape and greed. The everyday person will take this film for what it is, an epitet to the greedy and malicious HMO's which are supposedly the best alternative to full medical coverage. While the film sometimes comes off as a typical thriller, at least John Q experienced the consequences of real life as opposed to getting off scott free.",John Q
31,eric262003,"Good As A Drama, But The Thriller Is Forced And Clichéd",7,14 June 2011,"Sure the epic battle between good and evil has been done a million times, but you ask yourself, what happens when the good takes on a another rivalry that's also good. this is the case in the 2002 Denzel Washington vehicle ""John Q."". This movie focuses on the confrontation against the health care system, but at times the film tends to drift away from the exciting main plot and quickly drifts away into something more surreal and implausible. In this movie, Washington takes on the role of John Quincy Archibald, a financially inept factory worker who gets bad news upon hearing that his son Mike collapses during a baseball game. John and his wife rush the boy to the emergency room where the doctor reports to them that their son's heart is very large and a heart replacement is greatly needed. the situation takes a turn for the worse when the cardiologist and administrator (James Woods and Anne Heche who look cold and calculated) hands a $75,000 down payment in order for the procedure to commence. John doesn't have a lot of money, as he tries to squeeze out of his workman's insurance as much as he could get out of it, but word comes out that the company switched carriers and the most they have to offer him was $20,000. John goes as far as sell off all of his prized possessions, however that does him justice because he's still short of cash. This leaves John with no other choice to take matters into his own hands. He goes so far as to take the hospital hostage unless his son is placed on the donor's list. John's demands are taken into consideration by the police lead by hostage negotiator, Frank Grimes (Robert Duvall) and Police Chief Monroe (Ray Liotta), who's in the wings for reelection and asks to have John removed from the building in an efficient way. The hostages consist of a diverse group of unfortunate victims such as street thugs, a pregnant lady, another lady who might be or pretending to be a dingy broad, and a foreign woman who can't speak a word of English. Sure the victims are recycled clichés from other films from the past, but when it symbolizes the how health care functions in the United States, it transpires into the most implausible and reprehensible outlooks one could ever encounter. It's even more appalling when they're speaking with a gun near their heads. It takes a turn for the bad as it goes from a tearful drama to a severely cringing thriller with badly caricatured hostages. I'm sure this angle could've had a two-sided perspective to it, but its concentration sticks to this one-sided agenda. It might be due to the limitations of filming or to avoid any further complications so that the audience won't scratch their heads in confusion, or to avoid this movie from looking like a made for TV drama. But this painful ordeal to watch which makes you groan in disbelief.Washington has made some remarkable films over the years, but in ""John Q"", his credibility goes down a notch, being that he's been in much better roles than this one. Nonetheless, he still manages successfully to provide one of the most selfless characters on celluloid. Here's a poor working class man going out of way to find the money to pay for his son's surgery and the drama that he possesses is carried out to near perfection. The other standouts come from strong support from Kimberly Elise and Robert Duvall. As for the rest of the ensemble, they're reduced to just nothing more than badly drawn, one-dimensional caricatures. ""John Q."" overall was a well executed film and would have been better if it stuck to being a medical drama centering on a man going out of his way to save his son's life. It sadly falters due to the forceful suspense with cardboard characters, a lopsided script and a manipulative and predictable nature to it.",John Q
32,Chase_Witherspoon,ER meets PR,3,15 October 2016,"I really wanted to be sympathetic to the plight of these characters, their son denied a life-saving transplant due to complexities of insurance and the avarice of private healthcare providers, but I just couldn't tell where the political advertisement ended and the film actually started. Director Cassavetes seems to be flirting with an expensive commercial for a means-tested healthcare model which is fine (Hollywood jingoism is nothing new), though it's usually more subtle. Washington seems to have the right amount of despair and Woods plays the schmoozing cardiologist with aplomb; his characterisation brought more depth to what could've been a very one-dimensional part. Heche on the other hand as the cold, heartless 'system' personified, epitomised the hollow cliché that Woods somehow managed to avoid (by acting). The Liotta vs Duvall contest is also pretty shallow and unimaginative.Overall, despite the capable cast, it's difficult to distinguish ad from movie which I'd attribute mostly to the banal dialogue and overly clichéd approach taken. Could've had more tension, action and entertainment if they'd gone with Mel Gibson (a la Ransom, Payback) alas, the makers opted for a dramatic pose and the result is consequently extremely superficial and underwhelming.",John Q
33,Luigi Di Pilla,Dramatic Story - Worth Seeing,8,15 February 2004,I hesitated to buy it because I read in the critics that it wouldn´t be a realistic movie. Well at part it is true but only what concerns the operation conditions and some incredible scenes in the hospital. For the rest the story is worth seeing. Denzel Washington did a fine job and his wife in the movie too. This films critics in a very sharp way the real problem in the health organization and that everything works only with money. I hope the authorities will learn something. The movie had for me many twists and turns and sometimes I had tears in my eyes.

If this is not true the fault is the director's not mine because this movie proves it thoroughly. But the movie has a positive side because it shows also that mankind is not so bad after all. As a matter of fact we can witness a solidarity chain formed among the friends, neighbors and fellow-workers to help the father of the child who needs an urgent heart transplant and we can also witness the sympathy felt in the end by hostages held by him in a desperate attempt to overcome obstacles to that transplant that arise from the fact that he is a black worker who has no money to pay for it and the insurance company refuses to cover the necessary cost. This seems to confirm the statement according to which men are good and it's society which makes them bad.

I think it's a class-A piece of work!  This movie kept me on the edge of my seat the whole two hours and fifteen minutes.  Thinking back, there are a few scenes that are quite far-fetched--and made strictly to intensify the drama--but movies are not reality!  They are depictions of reality!  And if you have to push the limits of logic to keep the audience's hearts pumping with anticipation--then so be it!  Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors, and he is great as always. As he said, this role is sort of like an apology for his character in ""Training Day""--the meanest motherf**ker on the face of this earth.  In this case, he plays one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet.  Of course, he ends up waving a gun around halfway through the film, but when people are pushed to the limits, you'd be surprised what that person can do--whether it's a priest, a Buddhist Monk or a strict pacifist.  The supporting cast is also topnotch.  James Woods and Ray Liotta are also high up on my Top 20 list of favorite actors.  Robert Duvall doesn't quite make the list, but I deeply admire him as well.  All of them deliver riveting performances.  About the only thing I have to criticize is the score.  I felt some of the music added unnecessary melodrama.  As I tell people, filmmakers tend to depend too much on music, and less on the power of the performances. 
And of course, the film sends out a good message.  These HMOs can be cold-hearted.  And let's face it, there are many spoiled doctors out there who just care about the money.  I know, because my Dad has been in and out of the hospital recently.  John Q. did everything he could to raise the money for his child's heart transplant, but those damn doctors still didn't agree to perform the operation.  It's easy to watch this movie on a superficial level and say, ""That still wasn't right...taking people hostage and threatening lives of innocent people.""  But what would you do if you were in his shoes?  What would you do if you found out your son was hours away from dying and this transplant is his only hope?  You have to really think these things through before you base negative judgments on his character.  ""John Q"" is a powerful, edge-of-your-seat, riveting piece of cinema and I will even regard it as a MUST SEE!  This is one of the most exciting thrillers I've seen in a long time!

43,KnightsofNi11,Preachy? Maybe. Thrilling? Yes!,8,16 August 2011,"The healthcare debate is one that has waged on for too long. It has waged in our homes, our schools, and now in our movies. John Q is about a man who's constant screwing by the healthcare system has caused him to take drastic action to get his dying son the heart transplant he desperately needs. He takes the emergency room of a hospital hostage, demanding that his son be put on the donor list, something that costs $30,000, a budget the John does not have. The whole situation becomes a massive media frenzy with crowds of supporters standing outside of the hospital cheering for John and booing the police, an event that very much resembles the film Dog Day Afternoon. The film is partly an intense crime thriller and partly a touching story about how far a man will go for his family.Upon its release, John Q was not well received by critics. They said it was too preachy and too silly and over-the-top to buy into. I'll admit that the film does have a very in your face message about healthcare and the actions taken to display this message are slightly overblown, but they make for a fun movie. I think a lot of this negative reception comes from the timing of the film. It is blatantly liberal film released very soon after George W. Bush took office. This probably makes it even more in your face. But for me, watching the film in 2011, I very much enjoyed the message as healthcare is still a relevant debate nine years later. I think I enjoyed the suspenseful action more, but the message here doesn't bother me at all, and in fact I can take it to heart.The health care message makes the film important, but what makes it fun is the suspense and the great cast of characters. When John takes the hospital hostage he claims a wide array of hostages inside the building, each with a different backstory and personality. The dynamics between these characters are all very interesting, and the relationship they all build with John is an intriguing social experiment. And then of course there are the relationships John has with people outside. His wife's undying support for him creates an interesting character development, but more importantly is the Officer Frank Grimes(Robert Duvall), the police officer in charge of dealing with this situation. John has a number of conversation with Frank via walkie-talkie as Frank tries so desperately to keep the situation under control. Then of course things are complicated when the police chief Gus Monroe (Ray Liotta) shows up and is more concerned with his image than the actual situation at hands, creating another conflict between him and Frank. This melting pot of different characters creates an overall dynamic that is very interesting and great fun to watch unfold.John Q is a film that I very much enjoyed overall. It has its moments where logic seems to fall by the wayside, and there are times where things aren't executed as well as they should have been. I can't deny that the film is a tad preachy and it does wave a very obvious message in our faces. But overall this film is truly exciting, thrilling, and compelling. It is a lot of fun and my keen interest in hostage films makes me enjoy it even more. There is raw intensity and riveting suspense which makes this a very worthwhile film that shouldn't be missed.",John Q
44,esteban1747,A father fighting for his son's life,8,6 August 2002,"This is more than a film, it is a really good document about the injustice in rich societies, where money is much more important than a life of a child. To pay US$ 250 000 for a heart transplant is just an absurd because only millionaires can pay for it. The society in any country, moreover in rich ones, should try to guarantee life for its citizens, and children should have a priority. The argument of the film is valid and important to be touched although the ways used by the father of the sick child are not the best and may not solve the situation. In fact, the solution given in the film is just for this child but not to other children who may be in similar situation of sickness. Therefore, the film would have been perfect if it touched or suggested any way for parents to present their demands in medical care and medical aid for their children and even for their own lives. Denzel Washington acted pretty well as well as Dr. Turner (the veteran James Woods).",John Q
45,FlickJunkie-2,Shameless emotional manipulation and political pap,3,19 August 2002,"There is a scene in this film where John Q. Archibald (Denzel Washington) is applying for a job where the interviewer says, `Your qualifications are very impressive, as a matter of fact you may be overqualified.'  That should have been a quote from his casting interview.This is a horrible script with vapid dialogue and a bleeding heart so big that it is this film that needs a transplant; a brain transplant.   Films trying to make a political point (in this case an emotional appeal for National Health Care) are usually deft enough to bury the message in the subtext.  This one oversimplifies the issue, preaches unabashedly and even sends a parade of lefties to bang the drum and spew liberal pap all over the screen.  Films like this never seem to have trouble finding backers, but at least give us some semi-intelligent interchanges and believable scenes.Director Nick Cassavetes seems oblivious to the fact that the film is cartoonish, as he lets inane drivel attempt to pass as serious dialogue. With the exception of John Q, most of the other characters are cardboard cutouts of you favorite stereotype action figures.  We have the cold heartless hospital administrator (Anne Heche), the arrogant doctor (James Wood), the good hearted but dopey factory worker (David Thornton), the grandstanding police chief (Ray Liotta) and the street wise career cop (Robert Duvall).The story is totally predictable, telegraphing the outcome in the first three minutes.  Cassavetes seems content with TV level production values and milks the screenplay for every ounce of sympathy it can muster.  This is the most shameless emotional manipulation that one could imagine. 
There is a considerable amount of talent that flounders attempting to prop this film up.  Denzel Washington gives a good performance with one of the few characters in the film that is close to believable.  He makes John a very noble and respectable character with a warm heart and an iron will. Kimberly Elise is also credible as his wife, and Daniel E. Smith is lovable as his son.The rest of the cast should hide in shame.  James Wood is a terrific actor, but overplayed the pompous doctor routine to the point of being ridiculous. Anne Heche, who always comes across as a bit cold, takes this character to the arctic, only to become a weepy basket case at the end in a stunning reversal.  Ray Liotta and Robert Duvall are more like a Keystone Kops than serious cops.  Shawn Hatosy brings new meaning to the word obnoxious as the rich kid who brings the hooker he just beat up to the ER (sure, that's realistic; it happens all the time).This film isn't terrible, but it's close.  I really enjoy watching Denzel work, but this script is a total hack job, and as good as he is he can't save it.  I rated it a 3/10.  Do yourself a favor and don't insult your own intelligence by seeing it.",John Q
46,khatcher-2,Skip this one,2,11 October 2004,"If like me you have enjoyed some pretty acceptable films with Denzel Washington, I suggest you skip this one. Why Mr. Washington accepted such a role in such a pathetic film beats me. He cannot be that hard up, can he? Or is the taxman over-greedy again. I only put this one on because Denzel Washington is in it, otherwise I would not have bothered. Such films as ""Cry Freedom"", ""The Pelican Brief"", ""Philadelphia"", ""The Bone Collector"", have made sure that he is rightly one of the most popular actors on screen today. So why serve up this rubbish for us? Right, the film has things to say against the iniquity of the social services in the health sector in the U.S.A., but they - the director, for example, - could have dished up something more acceptable than a plate of watered bread.",John Q

I thought this was a really good movie, and it was done very well.  There isn't really much I can say other than it's a good movie.There is one problem I did have with the movie though.  I'm really not one to notice the music in a film (unless I own the music, then I recognize it). Most of the time I just watch the movie and pay little attention to the music, but I thought the music was kind of misplaced and odd at times in this film.  There were a number of scenes where I thought the music didn't make sense in that particular scene.  Strangely enough, one of the friends of mine that I saw it with, felt the same way as I did, and he even pin-pointed the scene I was thinking of without me saying anything about what scene I was talking about.  So, I know I'm not the only one that feels this way.Anyhow, other than the music issue, it was a great film, and you should definitely see it if you can.  Thanks for reading.-Chris",John Q
48,saadanathan,I'm surprised of how good it was 7/10,7,5 June 2020,"Denzel Washington along with a great cast of actors star in this drama thriller movie. An original story that has a deep message about the medical care in America. The movie starts a little slow and I thought to myself where is this plot going? Once John Q takes over the hospital it became clear to me what this movie was all about, it was worth waiting half an hour. I loved the chemic between the characters, how John Q is a simple man who wants his son to be healthy and doesn't want anybody harmed. John has a great relationship with the other characters and it's rare to see this in a movie where there are captors and hostages. Overall really good.",John Q
49,Spanner-2,Good acting saves predictible story,6,25 February 2002,"In this film, Denzel Washington is a working class everyman whose son neads a heart transplant (!!!) but the dastardly hospital administrator (played by ice queen Anne Heche) won't give it to him cause he doesnt have insurance!!! Thus, Denzel takes the whole emergency room hostage with a handgun in order to force the doc (James Woods of all people) to operate on his kid.. while Robert Duvall and Ray Liotta are the cops trying to talk him down.. or take him out... Another preposterous premise that exists primarily to take pot shots at HMOs.. an easy target in todays world... the film still manages to work because of the brilliance of Washington, who can make  his characters always interesting and sympathetic even in silly storylines.. Duvall is likewise believable in the hostage negotiator role, while Liotta as the chief of police is somewhat of a characature.. predictible stuff but works cause of the fine acting. GRADE: B",John Q
50,iohefy-2,ANOTHER STUNNING PERFORMANCE BY DENZEL WASHINGTON,9,12 February 2002,"Once again Denzel Washington has outdone himself in this delightful movie. I am getting spoiled when ever I go to see one of his pictures, as his depth is constantly great.  Mr. Casavettes does a fine directing job in this poinient story, but with bits of humor thrown in to break up the tension. This may not be academy award material, but it certainly is worth the price of a ticket.  Go see it, you won't regret it.",John Q
51,chrisbrown6453,"Too bad, this could have been something.",6,24 June 2002,"When director Nick Cassavetes went to work on John Q, I'm surehis heart was in the right place. He accepted this job because, with his daughter Sasha on a donated organ recipient list, he felt a connection with the characters and situations presented in the movie. Obviously, the subject matter stuck a resonant chord for others involved in the production, as well. The cast includes such notable names as Denzel Washington, Robert Duvall, and James Woods. Yet, for all of those good intentions, John Q turns out to be hopelessly mediocre - a poorly scripted, preachy fable that forgets about unfolding a coherent, believable story in its zeal to spread propaganda.John Q tells the story of a man, John Archibald (Denzel Washington), who is having trouble making ends meet. Since his work week has been cut from 40 hours to 20 hours, he can't keep up on the family's car payments, and eventually losses the car. When his son, Mike, collapses on a baseball field and is diagnosed as needing a heart transplant, John is confident that things will be okay, because he has medical insurance. Unfortunately, it turns out that his Tier II coverage doesn't cover $250,000 operations. The hospital director, Rebecca Payne (Anne Heche), refuses to put Mike's name on the organ recipient list until John can cover the $75,000 down payment. The cardiologist, Dr. Turner (James Woods), claims that the matter is out of his hands. But John's wife, Denise (Kimberly Elise), screams at him that he hasto do something. So he does - he takes everyone in the hospital's emergency room hostage. When the police, led by the crusty negotiator Grimes (Robert Duvall) and the chief of police, Monroe (Ray Liotta), arrive, he presents his demand: he will release the hostages when his son has a new heart. Otherwise, he will start killing them.  Oh yea, that's fair to the other thousands of people on the donor list.John Q's underlying concept has a great deal of relevance in today's world, where the term ""medical coverage"" is rarely mentioned without anaccompanying, profane adjective. Yet Cassavetes and screenwriter JamesKearns take this important issue and make it the fulcrum of a story that is divorced from reality by so many contrivances that it's almost laughable. From the moment when John storms into the hospital and takes over, believability goes out the window. There is no way that a lone man, untrained in fighting and with only a small gun, could take over the wing of a hospital, hold off the entire Chicago police force, and turn into an instant folk hero while threatening to kill innocent people. But that's not all - we also get loads of corny dialogue and several pointless subplots. A power struggle develops between Grimes and Monroe, but this is just filler.
And there are feeble attempts to satirize media zeal in the person of a TV reporter who's as concerned with his appearance as with getting the story. Films like Die Hard and The Negotiator have offered similar subplots to better effect. Here, they're just an annoying form of background noise.Speaking of annoying background noise - John Q's soundtrack, which features jarring instrumentals and at least one grossly out-of-place ballad, should have been replaced or re-edited at some point during the film's post-production phase. It's almost as if composer Aaron Zigman turned in his score without watching the movie. Normally, for me to notice it, a soundtrack has to be very good or very bad. Here, it's the latter case.There are times when acting almost redeems this movie - almost, but notquite. Denzel Washington is convincing as a desperate father who has run out of legal options and can think of no other alternative but to point a gun and hope no one calls his bluff. Robert Duvall has no trouble playing a veteran cop who probably loves the smell of napalm in the morning. Anne Heche and Ray Liotta don't test their ranges in their portrayals of dislikable individuals. James Woods offers an effective turn as a doctor caught between his oath and the system. Solid support is provided by Kimberly Elise as John's supportive wife and Daniel E. Smith as his dying son. There are no Oscar-worthy performances to be found here, but acting is not one of John Q's faults.Aside from the sheer implausibility of the principal action, the film's most glaring weakness lies in its inability to state its case with any degree of subtlety. People, even those who agree with the political doctrine being espoused, don't like sermons. And that's precisely what John Q turns into - a two-hour attempt to indoctrinate viewers into believing that the current health care system is in desperate need of reform (to me, this seems self-evident). The movie isn't content to show the inadequacies of the system - it talks about them endlessly in speeches that would have been at home in a public service announcement. Not only is this tedious, it's unnecessary - the events happening to John are sufficient to illustrate the situation.At its heart, John Q is a drama, but the movie frames several sections as action sequences, complete with artificially generated tension. There's a scene in which a sharpshooter climbs through the hospital's air conditioning ducts in order to get a shot at John. This is handled so badly (like something in a direct-to-cable B-movie thriller) that I found myself cringing. Sadly, that's the way I reacted to much of this movie - a good idea with noble intentions gone awry because of a poorly crafted screenplay and uneven direction. Next time Nick Cassavetes wants to tell a deeply personal story, he should rely on something that is less obviously manufactured by a connect-the-dots screenwriter.",John Q

A vehicle to deliver a sermon on the US medical system.",1,22 November 2005,"I remember hearing about this at the time it was made, and there was some praise for it tackling the topic of poorer people not receiving medical treatment and the dominance of Medical Insurance in the US. There were also two seemingly good factors about it, the first being Denzel Washinton and Nick Cassavetes. Yet it's taken until now to actually see the movie, and quite frankly, I wish I'd never wasted my time...that's an hour and a half I just won't get back.The plot is extremely transparent, and from the moment John Q. enters the hospital it becomes a standard and very formulaic hostage movie, complete with copy and pasted characters and situations.The Police Chief overriding the Negotiator and going in anyway, the Negotiator connecting with the Hostage Taker, and the Hostages connecting with the...you've seen it so many times before.One thing is different though, the moralistic change in James Wood's character of the Doctor. One second he's a money hungry surgeon, and then he just totally caves in and delivers a speech about the injustice of the situation. Oh, give me a break.The movie is over engineered and overly sentimental. The only good moment was seeing Washinton break up while he talked with his kid. The rest was very poor.This is a vehicle to tell us all what's wrong with the US medical system by picking stereotypes and a formulaic story to try and capture you into the movie in order to deliver the sermon. If the movie had been better and the sermon a little less sweet, then perhaps it would be better heard.",John Q

54,PudgyPandaMan,An extreme look at what's wrong with US Health-care,8,9 February 2009,"This is a movie with a message. While I don't agree with all the premises, and think that vigilante justice isn't usually the way to solve things - this movie does present some strong arguments.But I realize that they did many things to slant the story to get the audiences sympathy - even, if like myself, you are not a proponent of a socialist health-care system for our Democratic country. The best way they did this was by casting an adorable child as the innocent victim of a health-care system gone wrong. Add to that the very loving parents, played quite effectively by Denzel Washington and Kimberly Elise, who are also hard workers, and there is very little to fault them for the situation they find themselves in. Granted, this isn't the case for everyone in the US who find themselves without coverage (as there are many who are just too lazy to work and expect the government to provide all their needs without their making any effort).But, with politics aside, this is a very powerful movie that is heavy on the pulling of the heart strings. They do a great job of building and escalating tension throughout the movie - though some may find it manipulative. There is quite a stirring sacrifice offered near the end that I won't reveal but it really took me by surprise.I think one of my favorite scenes is the opening sequence with the impatient lady driving the BMW erratically through the mountains. It was beautifully filmed in slow motion with a rousing classical score to accompany. It was truly memorable and rather shocking in itself in the outcome and how it later ties into the resolution of the movie.",John Q

Denzel Washington finally gets a good role and is able to work with it to his liking.John Quincy Archibald (Denzel Washington) is a down-on-his-luck worker. He's about to be evicted from his home, he doesn't earn enough money, and is soon driven to the point of breaking. While at his sons (Mike) baseball game, the boy is overcome with convulsions. He is rushed to a hospital but his insurance coverage does not cover a heart transplant. He tries everything he can but can't get the money. He soon takes drastic measures as he takes twenty or so people hostage and takes over the ER at the hospital to get the transplant. Among the people is Dr. Raymond Turner (James Wood), a man who wishes John luck but can't give his son the transplant. Soon the situation turns into a police stand-off under the command of Lt. Frank Grimes (Robert Duvall) and Chief Gus Munroe (Ray Liotta). As the film progresses, impossible situations pop up from the hostages supporting him to John offering to kill himself so his son can have his heart. The film is a crusade against the American health system and though he portrays its message well, some scenes are just to impossible to believe. Washington delivers his best performance since Glory (1989). He is powerful in some scenes and emotionally affected in others. The acting in all is good, a good supporting cast and some well filmed scenes. This is a fine thriller, nothing to special just good.John Q.

The US media prefers to hide the problem and the Bush administration uses the inadequate health care system for political capital abroad, treating foreigners on the cuff and ignoring the needs of Americans like John Q and his family.I would have rated the movie a 9 or a 10 right up to the ending.On the other hand the feel-good ending muddies the point not only in a touch of unrealism that an untrained person could hold off a swat team but also that the police negotiators might ferret him out with lies and deceit.Thus I came to an over-all rating of 2 despite good performances from the cast.",John Q
58,rollernerd,What would you do? How far would you go?,6,19 April 2021,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! Queue in intro music**Tonight's movie review is the thriller drama John Q (2002) starring my man Denzel Washington who plays the lead character, a hard-working blue collar father whose son needs a heart transplant but who has run out of money and can't afford further medical heart transplant treatment. He finds himself at hopes end by finding out his insurance cover is flawed and the hospital his son is admitted to will be discharging. How far would a father go for his son? Take action in your own hands by holding the staff and patients of the hospital's emergency room hostage at gunpoint. Of course, as James Woods character mentions, you can buy a gun/arm weapon anywhere, anytime. Nicely put in to the film by the filmmakers. Soon Denzel needs to deal with a police chief played by Ray Liotta and hostage negotiator played by Robert Duvall, both policemen have their own methods to resolve the situation.First, Denzel is literally the Lebron in this movie - without him the movie would have been a disaster, in an epic way. He single handily saves this film from a being a dud melodramatic film where the script has its flaws in a naïve and obvious way and at times really ridiculous and really clichéd especially the whole SWAT/sniper scene, the heart monitor close-ups and the one of the abusive hostages trying to overpower Denzel. It has a real TV movie feels but with Washington who as usual delivers on-screen and he alone makes this film watchable for me.The director on every occasion informs the audience of the national health care crisis in the United States yet fails to delivery smart dialogue in particular the hostage situation between Duvall and Denzel and the hostages dialogue, for example the abusive partner and the stereotyping of a Latin American woman. And what the heck is with Eddie Griffin!!! And Robert Duvall and Ray Liota - legends in film literally did not deliver in this flick. Their performances weren't bad, but they were playing characters they could play in their sleep. Liotta as the chief role seems like a simple-minded goon by rocking up in full uniform and yelling at Duvall to acknowledge the fact he is a higher rank than him ""How do you think I got THESE?"" Anne Heche and James Woods were bad but who blames them with a script written the way it was. Overall, a valid method to educate the audience of the wrongdoings of HMO insurance cover and the health care disaster that was structures with many flaws however fails in the writing department - 6/10.",John Q

But when his ten-year-old son Mike is diagnosed with a cardiac condition and desperately needs a heart transplant that the family's insurer's refuse to pay for, John is force to take matters into his own hands. With his son weakening, John takes the staff and patients of a hospital hostage as he demands doctors perform the surgery.Denzel Washington plays John and, as usual, gives a very effecting performance that shows the strength and determination of a father's love without descending into schmaltz. Kimberly Elise, in her role as John's wife Denise nicely compliments his portrayal as a wife who wants a quiet life but will support her husband in anything if that is what it takes to save their son. The film also has strong support from Robert Duvall, as the hostage negotiator who sympathises with John but has a job to do, and James Woods in an uncharacteristically role as a spineless doctor who is more interested in his own life than the patients.The actual storyline was a bit too overly-sentimental at times but only someone with a hard heart couldn't be moved by John's plight. 'John Q' does highlight a number of ethical questions, such as how far should a parent go to save their child and, ultimately, how could such a tragedy happen in the twenty-first century America that a child is denied a heart transplant purely because their family can't afford it? Living in the UK, we have the National Health Service, which is far from perfect, but at least parents wouldn't have to take the law into their own hands to ensure their child is given the surgery they need to live. Despite the rather happy resolution to the film, there is still a sadness to the story because this sort of thing probably does happen despite America being so rich.'John Q' is a well-made thriller for those who also enjoy dramas and family-based films but it's also one which should be forced down the throats of every politician across the globe about why adequate health care should be provided for all, not matter what their financial status is.",John Q

Sadly John and his wife, Denise, don't have enough insurance to cover the cost of such an operation, no matter what they do they just can't come up with enough cash to save Michael's life. Desperate and angry at the money laden red tape, John takes the ER room hostage and demands that the transplant be done. For the most part it is horribly conventional and certainly doesn't come without flaws, but I find it intriguing, topically. I know the general public will say it's heavy-handed, preachy or something to this effect.I like how this drama turns into a crime picture/thriller after half an hour, which came totally unexpected to me when I first saw it, knowing practically nothing about the movie. It made you care a lot about the characters without boring you during their introduction. It presents a crime to you (a hostage situation) that to most people will seem justified, something rather unusual in movies. (V for Vendetta comes to mind, which makes terrorism seem justified.) Whether the crime is actually justified or not is the question 'John Q' asks the audience. And that's where, I think, the film succeeds. In offering a basis for further meditation and discussion about the topics and questions raised by the film.Furthermore it also is one of those ""What would you do in this situation"" movies that I like so much. Such motion pictures don't even have to do much to convince me, as half the flick is playing out in my head anyway. Those two things together with the fore-mentioned appreciated unexpected switch of genre half-way through make this overall unexceptional film absurdly exceptional to me.

""John Q"" is a great example of that. Despite Washington and a very strong supporting cast, they can't save this disappointing, overly manipulative drama about an under-insured father whose son desperately needs a heart transplant. Out of desperation, he finds it necessary to hold the hospital, it's emergency room and the people in the ER area hostage. I suspect that the screenplay (by James Kearns) has been revised to the point where the actions of the main and supporting characters are very suspect. I also believe the denouement was compromised for the sake of feeling oh-so-sorry for the main character and the situation he put himself in.

But in case you didn't know, this is nothing unique to HMOs. Virtually all private health insurance companies around the world offer policies where certain procedures or specialist consultations are excluded or the cost of coverage is capped in certain instances. In the rest of the world, all the important stipulations of the policy, such as this, are explained before the policy is taken out and is also provided to you in writing. By contrast, it seems that in the US, people never realise how much and what type of coverage they have with their HMO until a problem arises and they make a claim -which actually happens in this film. We see that Denzel ""amazed"" and ""infuriated"" when he finds out that he doesn't have enough coverage for a $250,000 operation. The old advice: ""Keep yourself informed of your own affairs"" undermines the point that these scene was trying to make, but oh well!! However, I'm not that cold hearted. I see that the film overall is trying to make a reasonably good point: when it comes to saving a child's life, why should our insurers/HMOs be quibbling over costs? And the best way to drill home this point is to show that it could (AND DOES) happen to anyone: perhaps a low level corporate employee on $45,000 - someone we would expect the HMOs to cover fully in such a situation. That would be a real ""wake-up"" call to everyone.But I felt that the lefties who bashed up this script couldn't help themselves and had to throw in all the old clichés and class warfare elements: Denzel's financially battling, we see his car get repossessed and his hours at work have been cut back to part time...and his health cover has been downgraded... blah blah blah. But he's a purely loving and caring father. In other words, the set up of Denzel's character is all a bit too-leftist-perfect for me to stomach. Further, all these clichés didn't really augment the major point of the film. In point of fact, it gave us an early glimpse of the political persuasion of the writers and as a result, you know how every supposed ""twist"" and ""turn"" will resolve itself! It's ""predictable by political extension."" Worse still, the film fails to deliver anyway and gets sillier and sillier. When John Q takes the ER hostage, you can see that the doctor, the hospital administrators, the policemen and the hostages were always going to wind up sympathising with John Q and in a loud Hollywood voice pronounce that ""ENOUGH IS ENOUGH when it comes to these nasty mean HMOs."" It's simply overcooked and the ending is more or less predictable. I suppose that holding up an ER and forcing it to shut down and turn away emergency patients is a very poignant and responsible way of getting things done. Of course, the film attempts to reel it's moral diversion back into line by acknowledging that Denzel will go to jail for this, but when you see his son smiling and thanking him at the end of the film, you sense that the writers don't really disapprove of his actions whatsoever. That is a bit troubling!Interestingly, though, there seems to be a major problem with the argument that they are trying to run throughout the film: there is a complete absence of any substantial criticism of the doctors, who refuse to even consider operating on the terminally ill child if his parents can't come up with $250,000 for a six hour procedure. For all that is said about lawyers, many (even good ones) will work pro bono or on contingent arrangements when a rare case arises. But when it comes to doctors, no sir-eee. It seems that they will refuse to lift a finger without being paid ridiculous fees in advance, even if an ""innocent child's"" life is on the line. Furthermore, this is one of those 1 in a 1000 operations, so you expect doctors to be ""warm-hearted"" enough to make some sort of exception or arrangement in the circumstances. But as this film shows, the doctors refuse and and they nonetheless escape a good deal of criticism. Instead, the writers heap it all on the HMOs and hospital admin; and even the hospital admin (led by Anne Heche) seems to come out of this mess smelling like a rose. Doctors are gods i suppose.As for the acting, Denzel did a reasonable job, but most other characters in the film were relatively wooden. I had no idea what the purpose of Ray Liotta's character was to this film, nor the tensions between him and Robert Duvall. It seemed to be very out of place or downright unnecessary. Heche and Woods were wooden. The hostages in the ER were the stereotypical gaggle of hostages and were rather unamuzing, uninteresting and ultimately unnecessary. And by the way, I understand the metaphor about the heart. ie... the HMOs and hospital admin are heartless, Denzel and his charitable community are warm-hearted and.... his son need a ""heart"" transplant. Any chance of being a bit more subtle with the use of symbolism and metaphor or are the writers so inherently patronising that they need to treat the audience like idiots and literally spell it out for them? Towards the end of the film, Denzel holds a gun to his head and is about to kill himself so that the doctors can take out his heart and put it in his son. By this stage, I wished that Denzel simply shot all the pathetic supporting cast, the director, the screenplay writer and anyone else remotely connected with this film before putting himself and this dismal film out of its misery.",John Q
72,Willie-12,"I've seen worse, but I've also seen much better",4,23 February 2002,"John Q is not the worst movie I have seen in my life. But that's about the only positive thing I have to say about it. I avoided it last weekend, because of the criticism it had received, but my wife talked me into seeing it this weekend (I wanted to go see Hart's War), and I now wish I had stood my ground. It should be a crime to have actors of this magnitude and then misuse them in a manner such as this. John Q is a perfect example of illustrating the fact that great actors (and a good performance by Washington), does not equal a great movie. It is also a good example of how important good direction and screen writing are, something Q was lacking. To say this movie was just manipulative is probably the biggest understatement of the year. The makers of this melodrama stop just short of sending someone to kick the crap out of you to make you cry. And unfortunately, this leads to a movie that was trying to make an important, powerful statement, but ended up being a sappy, corny wanna-be.

73,ijonesiii,A Very Human and Affecting Drama...,8,21 December 2005,"Denzel Washington continues to prove why he is one of the best actors in the business with his performance in JOHN Q, a moving, emotional, and tension-charged drama about a family man whose son needs a heart transplant; however, due to financial problems, his insurance won't cover the cost of getting his son on the donor list so John Q decides to take hostages in the hospital until someone arranges for his son to be on the donor list. Despite a preachy and simplistic screenplay, the intense direction and first-rate performances make this film work. I particularly loved Denzel's work here because this was a character unlike he had ever played before...Denzel usually played well-educated, intelligent lawyers and/or businessmen (with the obvious exception of TRAINING DAY), but here Denzel is playing an average Joe...a working stiff, struggling to pay bills and keep food on the table and a roof over his family's head who is driven to extreme measures to protect the family he cherishes so dearly. Washington gets strong support from Robert Duvall, solid as always as the hostage negotiator, James Woods as a wimpy surgeon, Anne Heche as an unsympathetic hospital administrator, and especially Kimberly Elise as John's wife. An emotional drama, wrought with tension, that will rivet you to the screen.",John Q
74,Newsense,Not as bad as they say it is,10,31 January 2009,"I remember when this movie came out there was a lot of criticism towards it. I can honestly say that the only good things I heard about about it was these positive reviews on Amazon. I was determined to see it and I was finally able to see it. Guess what? It isn't as bad as these critics say it is but then again the movie going public are usually made up of morons.Premise: John Q Archibald's son passes out during a baseball game. Once taken to the hospital John and his wife find out that their son has an enlarged heart. John goes through great lengths to get money just to get his son's name on the heart donor's list only to get screwed over by the same hospital that was supposed to look out for him. Down on his last luck, John Q holds the whole hospital hostage at gunpoint until his son's medical needs are met.Opinion: This movie is very touching as well as a sad testament to the issue involving healthcare. Many people bash the movie because they figure that the way John Q handled his son's situation was extreme but if you were in his shoes and handled that situation with passiveness then you deserve to get bullied by these corporate warthogs for being docile! Everybody with the exception of the ham that beats his girl fits into this movie perfectly. Eddie Griffin provided brief moments of levity, James Woods was great as the doctor who had to be forced into compromising and John Q is one of Denzel's finest performances. The movie has a happy as well as a sad ending but I wont spoil it for those of you who have yet to see it. They say that the message of the movie was hammered onto the audience but in a world full of proud-to-be-stupid people, the only way to get a message so serious across is to beat it into their thick heads. I'll part by saying that not every movie that is critically panned is bad and not every critically acclaimed movie is good. See it for yourself.",John Q

However, It was not an oscar winning performance. I have heard people complain that he deserved it for the Hurricane, but did not get it. He was the wrong choice for a black actor. Will Smith definitely deserved it, for Ali which was the greatest movie in the world. But the academy did not even think about giving him the award because they suck.I think Denzel should be nominated at the 2003 awards and win a real oscar. For John Q, this was an award winning role, i know some people dont think so, but they did not see what I saw. I saw a great actor, playing an ordinary father who loved his son very much.

I was fine in thinking that they were demonizing her as the heartless hospital administrator (though it was fairly awful) but she really fizzled in this one.  The supporting cast in the emergency room was far better than the leads.  That's just the acting.  The story was way too heavy handed.  I got the point very early on.

78,petit76,underrated phenomenon,9,18 June 2009,"Highly under-rated and ignored by most in 2002, ""John Q"" is one of those movies that is sometimes too intelligent for a viewing public unfamiliar with topics never really thought about in common societal circles (health care and insurance policies, rights of blue-collar citizens, media exploitation, law enforcement practices and over-paid medical specialists). Denzel Washington's young son falls out one day at a little league baseball game. The diagnosis is frightening. Without a new heart, the boy will most definitely die. Washington, a normal everyday citizen, lacks substantial resources and benefits from his insurance to even get his son on a donor's list. It is blatantly obvious that Washington and wife Kimberly Elise are being strangled by red tape in a mercilessly heartless (no pun intended) system. Friends Laura Herring and David Thornton (and seemingly countless other ordinary people) do their best to help the couple raise money and soon it seems that most everything they have is on the market to be sold. Work and more hard work does not get the couple much closer to having the money they desperately need. Washington realizes that time is now of the essence. He has been pushed and pushed again and now he takes it upon himself to push back. As a last resort he literally takes the doctor (James Woods) hostage, along with other bystanders who have nothing to do with Washington's war with the hospitals and insurance organizations. Immediately cops led by Robert Duvall and Ray Liotta surround the hospital and the tenseness builds. Hungry media cronies (who would not help Washington when he had asked earlier) also try to benefit from the misery of all those that are involved with their typical exploitation tactics (one thing Jerry Springer got right). Will Washington's son be saved and is Washington actually willing to take his own life in the venture so his boy can live? ""John Q"" is a very impressive production from director Nick Cassavetes (showing much of the same ability his late father John showed throughout his career). Screenwriter James Kearns gets to the soul of an American society that has been blinded by economics and inefficient big-wigs who have no business possessing the careers they have. Morality has gone out the window and that ""hypocritical oath"" that is so prevalent in the medical field seems to be little more than a silly afterthought. ""John Q"" succeeds everywhere just about except in its ending. The ending is a major mistake that took away from some of the good things accomplished before the final ten minutes. Washington, arguably better here than in recent triumphs like ""Training Day"" (an Oscar-winning role) and ""Antwone Fisher"", goes to an even higher plateau here. Much like Al Pacino in the equally under-rated ""Dog Day Afternoon"" (an admittedly better picture), Washington dominates in a role that thrives on a claustrophobic aspect that cannot be escaped or denied within the film's running time. Duvall and Woods are also solid, as always, but Washington is the man here. Strikingly accurate when pointing the finger at things wrong with America these days, ""John Q"" is a thought-provoking production that will cause its audience to think and learn about sometimes forgotten aspects of human life. 4 stars out of 5.

He chooses the police and his son seemed relegated for a lot of time. Therefore, Mr. Director: What is it? Another thriller action movie or an intense drama.  In fact the drama part is relegated to the mother of the son.  The intensity of the drama is losing and some parts look like pure sensibility. But you can accept that Mr. Casavettes tries to accuse the treatment of the people in hospital to persons without money, homeless, etc. and going back to the screen D.

82,Juan_from_Bogota,Deep Acting of Washington! Great!,8,20 April 2007,"In this movie, with a great acting of Denzel Washington as John Q. I felt the deep problems of health in the USA. My cousin lives in the United States (i don't), and she told me a few complaints about this problem; in the movie i finally understood about that. I don't understand how, the most powerful country in the world does have such bad health services to it's people?. For the benefit of the Americans, i hope that they change this system soon. Denzel puts his hearth on this movie, playing a normal guy with financial problems and a hard work; the way that Denzel shows his love to his son is remarkable and demonstrates why he is one of the actual best actors in Hollywood. If you have seen Searching for David's Hearth (2004), this is as the other side of the story.About the Movie: Denzel Washington plays John Quincy Archibald (John Q.) a husband and father with some financial problems that works almost 20 hours a day on a factory but who can't afford his expenses. John is trying to get a second job in order to earn an extra money. In the middle of this John's son Mike (Daniel E. Smith) is found to have a disease caused by a bigger than normal heart, and the doctors told him that he will die soon if they don't make a heart transplant. Here everything is hard but it gets really harder when John goes to the insurance company and get the notice that his insurance suddenly don't cover this type of procedures. John and his wife Denise (Kimberly Elise) start to make everything possible to collect the money (a lot of money) needed just to get his son on the donor's list, with their son dying an not much money, John desperate and takes the hospital's emergency room staff and patients hostage, demanding for to his son to be put on that list and that doctors do the transplant. The story evolves emotionally deep trough all this; in a remarkable script.About the Cast: Denzel Washington put his soul onto this role, being by far the best of all!!, Kimberly Elise does good too, but a little exaggerated sometimes, Daniel Smith as Mike is pretty poor in his acting, he didn't had to do that much but this kid (sorry) still isn't a good actor; he has years to perfect his performance. James Woods acting as Dr. Raymond Turner, as always is very good and professional, also Anne Hache as Rebbeca Payne is great and show a coldness that ripped me out. Robert Duvall acting is good but his character could have been deployed even more, for the good of the film.

83,jason_13,The Most Underrated movie with Denzel,8,11 February 2006,"Denzel's performances are some of the most underrated ever and this is surely his MOST underrated performance. The story is about a father and mother whose son immediately faints while playing baseball and he needs a hear transplantation. The problem is that surgery like that costs too much for the family. There are other problems as well and we realize that there is no way that the son could receive a new heart and the father takes justice in his own hands. It's a wonderful movie about the average citizen whose love is much more expensive than rich people's wealth. The movie is realistic in some ways. I mean a real father is gonna do all he can to save his son. After all family is the most important thing for any normal human being. It's a cliché of course, but I will always say that, cause I feel some people often forget it. I was touched by the movie. I wanted to help Densel's character, I wanted to be in the movie and I was sad at some scenes which rarely happens although I am a huge cinema fan and I mean real cinema. John Q is real cinema. Although I love most Denzel movies, I have a thought that John Q is the most personal while Trainning Day and Man on Fire, although considered as some of the best movies from the last couple of year, I think have some useless action moments. This one could have some as well, but it didn't. The story is great and I love that movie and I have to admit it was a positive surprise. And I want to point one more thing. We have great support actors like James Woods and Robert Duvall who are some of the greatest actors ever and this is not only my opinion. Duvall doesn't give a great performance, but his presence is enough. Woods's character is somebody who I wanted to kill and I guess this is the reason I liked his performance which is rather unusual for him than great or bad and since I like him, I would say he does a good performance. This is everything I wanted to say about John Q. I look in the details far too deeply, I guess, but the movie is incredible in my opinion and if I write a review about an incredible movie, I write it the way I feel it. John Q is one of the best drama movies from the past 10 years and it's a tie with Trainning Day in my Denzel rankings.",John Q
84,SwingBatta,"""John Q"" makes an impact with its message and passionate performances",8,4 March 2002,"Directed by Nick Cassavetes,  ""John Q,"" at first glance, looks like nothing more than a two-hour political critique regarding America's health-care crisis. The simple plot of a father taking hostages in an emergency room in his attempt to save his son serves as a cover for the true intent of broadcasting a proclamation concerning the state of health care in this country.But from beneath the tidal wave of propaganda emerges a sobering yet entertaining blue-collar film about an ordinary man who, out of nowhere, is suddenly mired in an extraordinary predicament.Judging by the actors that were assembled, it's obvious the casting directors did their homework. Their solid performances give life to otherwise everyday characters. Denzel Washington is simply amazing as John Quincy Archibald, an average Joe and family man beset by an onslaught of financial trouble. His hours as a factory worker have been slashed to the bone, and his wife Denise (Kimberly Elise) has had her car repossessed. And, to make matters extremely worse, his son Mike (impressively portrayed by newcomer Daniel E. Smith) suddenly collapses from heart failure during a Little League game.The hospital administrator, Rebecca Payne (Anne Heche), informs John and Denise that Mike is in dire need of a heart transplant, a procedure which will cost a mere $250,000. 75 grand alone will have Mike's name put on a waiting list.John's insurance won't cover the bills, and his bank account is in tatters. What follows is a gloomy series of edits showing him standing in long insurance and employment agency lines only to be told at the end what he doesn't want to hear. With assistance from his friend Jimmy (David Thornton), a redneck with a heart of gold, he attempts to raise the money himself.When it's learned that Mike is going to be released from the hospital, a frantic Denise implores John to ""do something."" And he does in a big way: he takes chief cardiologist Dr. Turner (James Woods) hostage, along with over a dozen others, in the emergency room.Enter Robert Duvall as Grimes, an aging hostage negotiator whose style conflicts with egotistical, camera-hungry Police Chief Monroe, who is played by Ray Liotta. (Obba Babatunde is underused in a brief role as a police sergeant.) Grimes wants to peacefully talk John out of the building, while Monroe would rather go in with guns blazing, kill him and get it over with. All the while, muckraking consumer reporter Tuck Lampley (Paul Johansson) takes advantage of every opportunity to boost his ratings, even if it means broadcasting an emotional phone call between John and his ailing son on national television.Among the rogues' gallery of prisoners are an obese security guard (Ethan Suplee), a burly man (Troy Winbush) and his pregnant wife, a street-smart wisecracker (Eddie Griffin), plus a (supposedly) blond bombshell and her greasy boyfriend (Heather Wahlquist and Shawn Latosy). Early on, Griffin is the groan-inducing attempt at comic relief, but he undergoes a surprising change as the climax nears.Though the plot is captivating, by no means is the script Oscar material. There are plenty of cliches abound, such as the inevitable good cop/bad cop conflict between Grimes and Monroe, and the inevitable hostage bonding (which brought back memories of ""Speed""). Meanwhile, Heche listlessly phones in her part. She disrupts the flow of nearly every film she appears in, even the powerful ""Donnie Brasco,"" in which she was simply unwatchable, and ""John Q"" is no exception.However, the scenes of John's interactions with Mike pack such an emotional punch that you would swear Smith really was Washington's son. With the right guidance, he could become a major star. While John is not a hero in the least, no matter how hard the film tries to portray him as such, Washington pulls viewers into his world throughout his trials and tribulations that it's hard not to sympathize with his situation. Together with Elise, they exhibit great chemistry as the struggling family.Despite the PG-13 rating, there are some very disturbing scenes of a family grieving over a loved one who lies dead in a hospital bed, plus several graphic surgical images.There's even a scene in which the hostages and doctors engage in a ""McLaughlin Group""-style bull session about health plans and ""bloodsucking"" HMOs. At the apex of the surprising ending, a montage of talk show snippets are shown, ranging from ""Larry King Live"" to Bill Maher's ""Politically Incorrect."" Before the closing credits roll, an on-screen proclamation reads, ""There are 48,000,000 Americans currently living without health insurance, and 7,000 Americans in 2002 alone will undergo medical procedures that they cannot afford."" It's food for thought that will leave a sour taste in your mouth.(In a tragic note of irony, one of the guests seen on Maher's program was Ted Demme, who died of heart failure just weeks before the film's release. Even more shocking was the fact that he had collapsed while participating in a sporting event, just like John's son in the picture.)Whether or not ""John Q"" succeeds at getting its message across to audiences nationwide, it does succeed at presenting a though-provoking albeit mildly flawed story, which will shock as much as it will entertain without becoming supercilious or heavy-handed. 8/10",John Q

Kimberley Elise is somewhat uneven, for example.  Her telephone demand of her husband to do something at one point in the film came unprepared, I thought.  I didn't see the desperation that would have dictated that moment mounting in her.  And the casting of Anne Heche was somewhat surprising.  She comes across early in the film as the mean corporate machine and then suddenly relents.  Why she relents is not altogether clear.

92,fred3f,a very long political commercial based on questionable assumptions,2,27 February 2005,"This is essentially a long political commercial for national health care. If you are looking for a good entertaining movie without a lot of political baggage, then you should be warned. The situation depicted is that of a man who can not afford a heart transplant for his son. In desperation he holds the hospital staff hostage until they agree to do the operation. Much is made, in the film, of the need for a national health care plan to avoid such situations. To my knowledge this situation has never occurred. There are several reasons why. The first is that doctors, in the main, are life savers and it is against their nature to refuse to save a life. One doctor might, but many others would step in to take his place. The second is that there is a Hippocratic oath which all doctors take. It commits them to saving lives. The oath does not have legal force, but it does have moral force and most doctors take it seriously. The third is that hospitals, like any other support institution, need to have a good community reputation in order to continue to function. A situation would give a hospital a very bad name in the community, causing all kinds of problems with funding, attracting staff and patients. In the unlikely event that this situation would happen in a hospital, another hospital would quickly offer to do the service.That aside, there are reasons to like this movie. Denzel Washington, as always, gives a great performance. Other cast members also do a stellar job. If you like to have your heart strings tugged, this film does it in spades. But emotion is often used to push a political message, without having to resort to actual fact or reason. It is a type of manipulation that we see far too often, today, in Hollywood. Viewers should be warned that this is that type of film.So if you decide to see it, enjoy the emotion and acting, but when it comes to the political question, as always, don't decide on an emotional appeal. Don't blindly follow the ideas of anyone. Do your own research and make up your own mind after examining the facts from both sides. The political slant got too much in the way of the other good qualities of the film for me, but it may not bother you. Without the politics I would have given it a 7.",John Q

But good god this is a ridiculous movie. More than half the Anne Heche dialogue is mental, no one in her position would speak like that, then the sudden change of pace from the bigot doctor? No.

95,sheepmonk2000,John Q is pretty desperate filmaking,4,16 June 2011,"This film comes off pretty desperate in all the wrong ways. Every line of dialogue appears to be geared towards tugging on the heart strings of the audience and it all becomes very formulaic, predictable, cliché and somewhat boring by the end. The character of John Q is played well by Denzel Washington, but like the film you do get a sense that you've seen it all before. Robert Duvall is pretty inadmissible as the cop whom John Q puts his trust in, Ray Liotta is pretty solid in a small role - although again quite samey. And Anne Heche plays her character of queen b*tch suitably well too, until of course right at the last minute when she finally thaws and gives in to Q's demands. The real revelation amongst the cast is definitely the actress who played Mrs Q (sorry don't know her name). She certainly brings credibility to her part and the film is worth a watch alone based on her performance. That's not to say she deserved an Oscar but she is good in it. So all in all, the film is terrifically unrealistic and lacks any real tension, but the cast are all watchable, if a little familiar and so therefore I rate this film 4/10 (2*).",John Q
96,calm,Denzil is doing everything right,10,15 February 2002,"John Q is predictable but on purpose.  The plot comes together quite well because of it's predictiveness.  Denzil gives a stunning performance as a father who is both an obedient husband, down on his luck and as a loving, caring father.  While I'm not sure if this movie was based on a true story or not, I found ""John Q"" guilty of the usual Hollywood antics like a news anchorman who happens to have the ultimate communications geek in his employ, enabling the national viewing of a police blunder, LIVE on TV.  I have yet to see antics like this in real life.  Kimberly Elise gives a believable performance as the desperate mom who demands that her husband ""do something"" after all hope has been yanked away by hospital bureaucrats. After seeing this movie, Denzil should win the Oscar this year for ""Training Day"".  If that sounds like an oxymoron, blame it on the academy.  James Wood, Anne Heche , Ray Liotta and Robert Duvall are worthy as die-hard, by-the-book, servants of the people who can't take YES for an answer.  I stayed on the edge of my seat and clapped twice before the movie was over. A good thriller.",John Q
97,yfguitarist,A silly little flick,1,9 May 2006,"This is just ridiculous. The premise is good, and the acting is too, and it starts out interestingly enough, but that's about it. Denzel's character is seen as a hero in his actions, but he was self-centered and ignorant, to say the least. He didn't take into account all the other people he was hurting (including his own son) by taking people hostage and offering to give up his heart for his son. Because he can't deal with the grief of losing a son, he'd rather let his son deal with the grief of losing a father.It's ludicrous how the hostages respond to the situation. ""He's so brave! What a hero!"" seems to be the general consensus. It's so melodramatic and predictable. You can tell when a ""crying scene"" is coming up and you end up just rolling your eyes at the crap that comes out of John's mouth. The end is so ""feel-good"" that I thought, ""The whole gang's here! Gee golly!"" when the hostages join John at the trial.",John Q

In fact, it comes complete with news clips from real-life political activists weaved into the end of the movie. So, this movie does not try to pretend. It is as much of a commentary as it is a movie.I won't comment on the political aspects of the film, but the movie itself was fairly average. It was melodramatic, sappy at times and fairly predictable. It was definitely not any of these actors best performances, but this was not a movie about performances. It was primarily meant to deliver a message not to entertain. Since I normally go to see films to be entertained this movie was disappointing. So, I would only recommend this film if you want to get insight into the issues that poor people face with healthcare, although CNN, MSNBC and Dateline might be better options. 6/10 stars.-- DP.",John Q
100,pc_dean,Take Your Medicine (possible spoilers),5,18 February 2002,"""John Q"" is the kind of movie Frank Capra would have come up with had he been a bitter burnout under the pressure of a heinous studio deadline and half a bottle of barbiturates.The movie starts out promisingly enough.  We meet John Quincy Archibald (Denzel Washington), a hard-working, decent Chicagoland machinist.  He is having money problems in the slowing economy, but dearly loves his wife Denise (Kimberly Elise) and 9-year-old son Mike (Daniel E.Smith).  In the first few scenes we get to know and like the Archibalds (good thing, too, or the movie would be even tougher going) before the trouble starts.  Mike collapses during a Little League game and his parents learn that his heart has a rare defect that will cause him to die unless he gets a transplant.Thus begins the best part of the movie, as John Q slowly realizes the cruelty of the deck stacked against him.  Not only has his insurance coverage been changed to an HMO (boo, hiss) without his knowledge, but his status has been downgraded to ""part-time"", as he works less hours.  Vainly fighting against a system that won't help him, can't help him, could have helped him but he filled out the wrong forms, he becomes increasingly desperate, until, having exhausted everything he knows how to do, he pleads, cajoles, begs, and finally pulls out a gun.At this point, everything is set for a fantastic issue picture and character study, as John Q seizes control of the emergency ward and demands that his son be placed on an organ donation list.  The scenario calls up pretty heavy questions of individual and societal morality, of how far we can or might go.  Is what John Q does understandable?  Is it right?  Is it terrorism? What would we do?Unfortunately, the movie either shrugs off these questions or gives pat, glib answers, in favor of a standoff thriller that doesn't work.  The police show up, with a weathered negotiator (Robert Duvall), and proceed immediately to break every rule of hostage negotiation:  they allow crowds into the containment area.  They place legions of cops in plain sight right in front of the hospital.  They give out personal information in negotiations.  They put third parties on the phone to talk to John.  They don't talk to his family or friends (and only briefly to his wife).  They make concrete assurances they can't possibly keep.  They send his son in. They have a special-ops officer in full BDUs plus the chief of police(!) stand next to Duvall while he negotiates with a distraught man waving a gun. They make a move on John Q using one lone guy in the vent shafts to take a shot so dubious even Carlos Hathcock wouldn't have tried it.  And more.  If I were a member of the Chicago PD's famously patient Hostage/Barricade/Terrorist Unit (which in its first ten years resolved over 200 incidents without killing anybody) I'd be inclined to sue for slander.  Incidentally, the movie credits as ""SWAT Consultant"" something called ""Final Option"", but nobody from the Chicago police.  Small wonder.The movie glosses over the more subtle aspects of hostage situations.  With few exceptions, John's eight hostages (kinda sparse for the ER of a big-city trauma ward, but oh well) Stockholm with him in nothing flat, and only one ever asks to use the bathroom (we never see what, if anything, John does about that).  He also becomes a folk hero almost instantly.If ""John Q"" is a mediocre hostage drama, it's a downright irresponsible moral statement.  Because the movie obviously approves of what he's doing, it doesn't examine the implications of it.  John allows a critical gunshot victim to enter the ER (after shooing away the paramedics), then makes a neophyte resident and a specialist in the wrong specialty work on him without proper staff or equipment.  The movie sells this as an act of great humanity, never mind the risks to the man's life.  Shutting down a big-city ER potentially puts a lot of people at risk, but the movie essentially leaves that issue alone.  While it's easy to sympathize with John, it's impossible to sympathize with the crowd that gathers to cheer him on and hiss and berate the cops on the perimeter.  After all, they're cheering for a man who has stated his intention to start killing hostages (most of whom had nothing at all to do with his son's case) in one hour if his demands aren't met.  Do they assume he's bluffing?  Do they care?  Does the movie? We're never sure.The movie's analysis of the health-care issue also fails to satisfy, relying mostly on shrillness and easy targets.  Toward the end of the movie we get a montage of wealthy liberal blowhards bemoaning the greed and heartlessness of the ""medical establishment"" (in a sad irony, sitting silent in one of these clips is the late Ted Demme, who died of heart failure shortly before this movie was released).  But the fact is that socialized medicine schemes and rampant lawsuits can screw things up just as badly.  While I wouldn't want my barricade pic to devolve into debates on cost/benefit ratios and risk assessment, some acknowledgement of the complexity of the issue would have been appreciated.It is greatly to ""John Q""'s benefit that it has Denzel Washington, an actor of such talent and gravity that he lends credibility to any fool thing he's in.  From his breakfast table to his siege, he makes a real and likable person out of John Q, and his increasing desperation is vivid and real.  It is only because of Washington that this movie functions on any level at all. It's a shame Capra never got to work with him.  With the exception of Kimberly Elise's moving performance as Mrs. Q, the rest of the cast is not up to snuff.  Duvall seems to be a hazy carbon copy of the tired cop he played in ""Falling Down"", Anne Heche is an icy caricature as the hospital director (named ""Payne"", no less), and Ray Liotta leaves little impression as an underwritten glory-hound police chief.  Eddie Griffin is along as a hostage to provide comic relief.  He provides none.  James Woods is a little better as the cardiac surgeon John holds hostage, but he isn't given much interesting to say.Reportedly, director Nick Cassavetes was drawn to this movie because of his daughter's medical problems (the movie is dedicated to her), so it's easy to see where his sympathies lie.  But ""John Q"" pretends to raise tough questions only to dodge them (the ending is the ultimate dodge) and seems to want us to swallow a pretty undigestible philosophy: that using violence to stop a gunman threatening to kill eight innocent people is wrong and reprehensible, but terrorism in the name of universal coverage?  Well, that's okay.",John Q
101,isotope2112,Predictable,3,29 January 2003,"*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*I was thoroughly disappointed with John Q.  I figured with Denzel, Liotta, Duvall, and Woods this should at least be a decent film.  I will never again underestimate the ability of a bad script to ruin a movie.  This David (i.e. John) vs Goliath (i.e. the big evil HMO) story is so ham-handed in it's attempt to make the viewer revile the HMO and feel sorry for the poor suffering family that it is almost laughable.There is one scene that sums up how ridiculous this movie is.  At one point in the movie, John gets into a scuffle with an abusive husband who is one of the hostages.  John loses his gun and it sits on the floor while he fist-fights the abuser.  Does one of the other hostages pick up the gun in an attempt to free themselves?  No... they watch the fight and cheer as John kicks the tar out of the guy, then picks up his gun.  I'm willing to suspend disbelief for a movie, but this willing hostage thing is too much.   John Q is the sort of boring, predictable junk that Hollywood continues to commit to celluloid.  You seriously can see every twist and turn before it happens.  If you've ever wondered what it's like to be psychic, rent John Q.",John Q
102,golem3,Hostages for Hospital Care  Not at all like the Food for Oil Programme,8,3 October 2005,"John Q is one of those kinds of movies that arrives and disappears fairly quietly  not raising a lot of box office ruckus and media hype. It is however, a powerful story about one man's desire to save his son at all costs.John (Washington) is a character who has little money but a lot of leverage. Mr. Washington plays a fantastic and desperate father who refuses to take no for an answer. Grimes (Duvall) is also well played, albeit filling a clichéd role of a cop.You will find that there are some touching moments and some where you wonder about who Mr. Q really is, and what his motives are. This is largely because Mr. Washington does such a good job of creating his diverse character that is caring yet brutal at times. One almost sees the intensity of his brutality from his role in Training Day. So in essence, Mr. Washington's role as John Q should have warranted at least an Oscar nomination.The strong part of John Q is that the supporting characters that surround him are more useful in building and sustaining his character than in most other movies. In any case, don't want to give away too much for those who haven't yet seen this film. This movie is a character movie - the plot is fairly slow and predictable at least by one moment, and then the story must unfold of how things happen.I mean, at least it was ethical. Right?

103,Movie-Guru,Good Movie...,8,18 June 2002,"Despite what people have said, this movie is NOTHING like Dog Day Afternoon. The only similarities between the two is that both films have to do with holding a public place hostage (In Dog Day Afternoon it was a Bank in John Q, its a hospital).  Sure, you see a sort of homage to Dog Day Afternoon in John Q, but thats it, the movie has its own plot.  I enjoyed this film, Denzel Washington is really believeable as the down-on-his-luck father, and the rest of the supporting cast executed their characters very well.  Most notably the great Robert Duvall as the hostage negotiator and Ray Liotta as the stuck-up police chief.  I won't say more about this movie other than it is heart-breaking and you can almost feel the pain frustration John Q has to go through.  4 stars out of 5.",John Q
104,FargoUT,Only for the idiots out there...,3,19 February 2002,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Let's face the simple truth: you will be hard pressed to find someone who likes the insurance industry.  It's a double-edged sword, however.  We couldn't live without them, no matter how much we may hate it.  Shelling out premiums from every single paycheck, only to still be required to come up with money to cover medical procedures.  It's a pain in the ass and we all hate it.  So it was only a matter of time before Hollywood came out with a film to capitalize on that hatred and resentment.  And here it is in the form of ""John Q"".Unfortunately, ""John Q"" is not only a bad film, it's a misguided film. Taking a firm stance against HMOs, ""John Q"" demands that America come up with a better solution.  My own suggestion would be to take the money used to fund this film and send it out to all those who will need mental insurance coverage for watching it.  After viewing this movie, I came out conflicted: I hate HMOs as much as the next person, but I hated this movie even more.  It presents the material in such a one-sided and manipulative way, I almost feel my brain has split a personality.  One part wants me to laud the film with praise for attacking an evil industry; the other, more rational part wants me to shred the film for taking the easy way out.""John Q"" begins with a BMW swerving and passing cars on a lonely highway. Needless to say, this car crashes, killing its driver.  If you've seen the trailers, you know exactly why this scene is here (John Q's son needs a heart, a woman just died with a fine heart, you do the math).  We are then introduced to John Q. Archibald (Denzel Washington), your average blue collar worker.  His supportive wife Denise (Kimberly Elise) and their only son Mike (Daniel E. Smith) play silly games on the way to school--see how normal these people are?  The only thing missing is a good church scene. Oh, nevermind, they included that too.  This, of course, all leads to tragedy during a little league game.  Mike, stealing second base, clutches his chest and drops motionless to the ground.Turns out Mike's heart is three sizes too large (someone call Dr. Seuss, stat!).   Without a transplant, he will die.  We are told this by the hospital administrator Rebecca Payne (Anne Heche) and the cardiologist Dr. Turner (James Woods).  It's at this point you realize the callousness of the filmmakers.  Portraying the administrator and physician as villains, they sit coldly emotionless as John and Denise cry over the predicament.  There is no insurance, and the procedure will cost $250,000.  These two ""villains"" are never afforded the thought that perhaps they see this same scene played out so often, they are beyond emotion.  Of course, without them, we wouldn't have the satisfying emotional arc for when they both instantly become human again.John, trying desperately to raise the money to no avail, must take drastic measures, taking the emergency room of the hospital hostage.  With a strangely colorful assortment of characters, John soon starts a debate with Dr. Turner.  The police surround the ER, lead by Frank Grimes (Robert Duvall), chief hostage negotiator.  John doesn't take well to Grimes' attitude, and soon threatens the lives of his hostages.  Either his son gets a new heart, or he starts killing hostages (the logic of that still doesn't make much sense).""John Q"" tries so hard to make you weep, cueing the orchestra at just the right moments.  Sadly, when the music swelled, so did the bile in my stomach.  First-time screenwriter James Kearns is primarily to blame for this travesty.  The plot alone plods along at an insipid pace, you may find yourself hoping the sniper shoots him just so it ends.  As if that weren't enough, Kearns' dialogue is some of the absolute worst I've ever heard in a major motion picture.  Stilted, corny, and stupid, even the talented Washington can't help it.  Just thinking about the screenplay makes me so angry I find myself having trouble coming up with descriptions.  How a piece of garbage like this could get made is beyond me.Nick Cassavetes doesn't help the matter either.  With his rancid directing (his last film was the equally awful ""She's So Lovely""), the film plays out artificially.  You never really believe for a moment Mike will succumb to his heart condition, despite that his systolic blood pressure drops below 80 (this device almost served as a heart-induced countdown--thankfully, it is forgotten quickly).  Portraying a completely one-sided issue, we are forced into cheering for John.  This sort of manipulative filmmaking is quick to turn me off.  You hear the arguments for why the medical industry is evil, and yet it's a direct result of America.  It's based around capitalism. During the final few minutes, small news reports sum up the events.  One commentator makes the only valid and rational argument in the film, stating it is our fault the medical industry is the way it is.  We want better coverage, but we don't want to pay for it.  Sad this moment came so late in the film.Poor Denzel.  After getting an Oscar nomination for his (vastly overrated) turn in ""Training Day"", he gets sapped with this God-awful role.  Of course, we shouldn't feel too sorry for him, since he did choose it.  Even the strongest of actors couldn't get this material to work.  The only real moments of acting come from Kimberly Elise as his wife.  Ray Liotta is handed the annoying task of being the harsh, uncaring police chief.  In any other hostage film, he'd be the hero, and we'd be cheering him on to take out the hostage taker.  But here, not a chance.  He's the villain.  Robert Duvall seems to be sleep-walking his way through his role, while Anne Heche tries desperately to bring humanity to her inhumane character.  Even the usually reliable Woods can't wade through the crap he's given.The film ends on a cheap note, with the police arresting the wrong man (I almost bolted for the exits, but figured it was almost over anyway).  This doesn't come as a surprise, and it shouldn't be treated as one.  I am not spoiling anything, because the filmmakers are so bad at setting up this ""false"" ending, it's really quite pointless.  We get to witness a very graphic operating scene (how this film managed a PG-13 rating is beyond me), and not only that, the doctor actually taps the heart to make it start beating.  It's one of those ludicrous moments that, if happened in real life, you might punch out the doctor.  Ah, but Cassavetes isn't finished. He even includes a short glimpse of recently deceased Ted Demme, the director of much better movies than this one.  Why the clip is in the film is beyond me, as it serves no purpose whatsoever, but it did remind me of how crappy Nick Cassavetes is as a filmmaker.""John Q"" is rated PG-13 for violence, language and intense thematic elements.  To put it simply, and taking a cue from Roger Ebert, I hated, hated, hated, hated, hated this movie.  I hated every single moment of it. It was a false, manipulative sapfest that wants to get its audience riled up over a subject people already are riled up over.  The music is bad (including some weird vocalizations that can not be explained), the direction is worse, and the script is bottom-of-the-barrel garbage. Talented screenwriters lurk on the outskirts of Hollywood, desperate for a chance to get a film produced.  Instead, we get this.  The state of HMOs concerns me, but for now, that Hollywood actually let this film be made, the state of Hollywood is just as bad.  Shame on you.",John Q
105,gbrumburgh-1,"Not even Denzel can save this misguided, at-the-end-of-one's-rope drama that gets progressively sillier and sillier.",2,12 July 2002,"From the introductory scene of a pretty young female motorist weaving capriciously in and about menacing semis accompanied by a strange, lush score, one smells trouble early on.  But, you say, a movie with Denzel Washington at the acting helm will automatically right itself and avoid the obvious curves and potholes that could lead to disaster, right?  Nope. Both the lady and the film are D.O.A.Direction, writing and performances are so wretched, I found myself unintentionally laughing at its most serious of intentions.Washington plays a struggling, low-to-middle class income factory worker with a working wife (supermarket checker) and son.  At the beginning of the movie we see one of the family cars getting repossessed and dad scouting out a second job due to cut-backs at work.  Things get so bad the cute youngster even offers dad his $46 dollar allowance savings.  I guess the family that pays together, stays together.Anyway, all seens endurable until the young Little League whippersnapper suffers thumper problems while running from first to second base (or was it second to third?) after hitting a line drive.  Rushed to the hospital, the parents find out their son has an enlarged heart and needs a transplant very soon in order to survive.  Trouble is, Denzel's insurance (remember, he's part time now) won't cover the $200,000 plus, and he and the Mrs. are destitute.And the treacly dramatics that were tolerable up to this point now go haywire.  What we really end up with is a movie that pushes for health insurance reform.  To HMO or not to HMO: that is the question.  Well, gosh, if that's all, why not just a ""20/20"" featurette?After the big bad hospital tells Denzel his son has to to be released due to it's strict ""no-money, no-heart"" policy, our hero goes ballistic and holds the entire emergency room at gunpoint until his son is put on a donor's list.  In a series of bad moves, the movie dissolves into a massive, gooey mess that strains reality with every heart beat.  Hostages rooting for Denzel, the swarming public rooting for Denzel, the wife rooting for Denzel, the bad, bad administration now rooting for Denzel.  Everyone's rooting for Denzel...except the script.The always charismatic Washington looks so focused here, he doesn't realize he's in such a stinker.  But Robert Duvall, as a hostage negotiator, sure does, and he looks mighty uncomfortable.  And for good reason.  His at-odds scenes with an over-the-top Ray Liotta, as a press-hungry Chief of Police, are ridiculous and superficial.  Kimberly Elise as Denzel's wife may have a couple of true moments as Denzel's emotive wife but hardly enough.  Anne Heche too is given short shrift as a ""heartless"" hospital administrator. Amazingly, this is a top-notch roster of stars and each and everyone comes off like a rank amateur.The most laughable moments are saved for the hospital emergency room where Denzel holds hostage a motley crew of staff, security, patients, and (apparently) bad actors, including the usually terrific James Woods -- not-so-terrific as the hospital cardiologist.  These are among the worst group crisis scenes I have encountered since ""The Poseidon Adventure"" thirty years ago.A major crash and burn for the usually reliable Denzel.  He offers his heart (literally!) to this picture and the tears seem real enough, but the deck is stacked.  A poor choice of roles right after his award-winning ""Training Day.""

John Q proceeds to commit dozens of felony counts ranging from ADW to kidnapping, plus endangering numerous other patients' lives by shutting down a major hospital ER. From this point on, about the best he can hope for is 20 years in prison (I'd vote for life if I was on the jury), and you can bet that any promises made under duress would be revoked as soon as the police get the cuffs on.

But let's get back to the movie and its errors.How is it possible that a professional sniperist misses a clear shot.This is the biggest mistake of this movie.They should erase that scene from the movie.Than the subject is pretty dangerous.Imagine how many people suffer from that and have no money for the surgery.So try to imagine what will happen if they all kidnap doctors and use them as hostages for they personal interests. What I'm really trying to say is that Hollywood should be careful about the movies they release.Once there was a guy who jumped from the 13-th floor trying to copy SUPERMAN.

My basic problem with it is that themain character was just too perfect.  Perfect dad, perfect husband, perfect friend, but somehow just can't get a good job.

111,scs0,"Excellent movie, but soured by Big Brother politics",1,28 July 2002,"The only reason Denzel Washinton didn't get Best Actor for this film is because he won for his role in Training Day.  The story was also excellent, however the heavy-handed helping of Big Brother politics, largely at the end, leaves the viewer with the sense that they were duped into watching a propaganda film.  The movie comes down hard on HMOs and its solution to the problem?  A government run HMO where membership is mandatory!  (I wonder if membership includes a uniform?)  This movie makes you think, but not in the intended direction: If health care is a right and not just a need, isn't Denzel denying thousands their right to health care by taking a huge multimillion dollar salary and spending it all on himself?  Did New Line Cinema donate all of the profits on this movie to medical charity or did those involved walk away with hefty salaries and BMWs?  ""Rights"" mean people are guaranteed legal protection to engage in a certain activity, so in a society where welfare is somehow considered a ""right"", others must actively supply goods and services to fulfill that ""right"".  Therefore, since ""40 million people"" don't have health care coverage people who spend any money on themselves on luxury items are denying another their right to health care!  Unfortunately for New Line and Denzel, this is not the kind of thoughts they wanted people to leave the movie with, but when your film makes hundreds of millions in revenue, who care if your intent goes through?",John Q

What do we have to dig up from the *american values* to get away with that?And the movie delivers, all the way from that starting point and on to the sentimental end. People do love the terrorist.For all of us non-us people, this movie is a great and horrible lesson. It's a journey into a truly alien mindset. It must surely have been produced with a grim ironic smile. The moral is that there is a point where terrorism is ok.

This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. There were four points n the movie where I cried. I cried when the parents were told about Mike's heart, I cried when he talked to his on on the phone, I cried when he was saying goodbye, and I cried as he drove away. This movie shows us where we as people are coming to. His son needed a heart transplant, but the hospitals said no, they couldn't do it, because they didn't have the money. A little boy almost died because of our greed. And that isn't just Hollywood hogwash; that happens everyday. We have people ripping off other people, people murdering one another, all for greed. Where is this world coming to?I've read some comments on this movies message board of people calling John Q. selfish.

This ""film"" is about a man so desperate for health insurance to pay for his son's operation that he takes the emergency room hostage until his demands are met. Though this is how far many of us would go, this film is nothing but a long letter-to-the-editor, in which the writer (James Kearns) just wants to get his opinion out there. It is obvious that ""John Q"" was fuelled by the writer's beef with the healthcare system, so he threw together a feverish movie so he could trick people into agreeing with him. Definitely a bring-down purpose of any movie. If you want people to hear your opinion, write your congressman, don't waste a fine cast or use up your screenwriting talent.",John Q

116,Bosco-HK,A father pushed to the limits...,7,10 December 2012,"Denzel Washington plays John Quincy Archibald, father of Mike (Daniel E. Smith) falls hard all of a sudden at a baseball game, which ultimately set the story in motion. The diagnosis, needing a heart transplant, everything only get harder when John goes to the insurance company and finds that his insurance does not cover this type of procedure.The movie tells about an American society that has been blinded by capitalism. Everything is in the dire hands of 'Money'. The hospital, unwilling to do what they would normally do to save someone's life, turns a head only to put his son onto the transplant list if they had the money. James Woods who stars as Dr. Raymond Turner, display rigidness of professionalism, while Anne Heche who stars as Rebecca Payne, display utter coldness that nearly got me wanting to pick up a chair and throw it at her.Every day even before what had just happened, John and his wife Denise (Kimberly Elise) tries their best to make ends meet, and then now trying and doing everything possible to collect money needed just to get his son on the list. A father, loving and caring, must come up with 250,000 dollars to pay for his son's heart transplant. Their friends, and countless others, do their best to help the couple raise money. Soon, almost everything they have is on the market and sold.It was not enough. Out of options, and out of time, a father pushed to the limits to save his son. In all desperation and having hardly enough to get anything accomplished, John holds the entire hospital's emergency room hostage. He sets the one demand for his son to be put on that list so that the doctors can proceed with the transplant. The ending only leaves you chills to the bone as to what a father is left to do in order to be heard.Denzel Washington is one of the greatest actors of our time and he proves it here playing a father in utter distraught. I recommend this movie!",John Q

Is it they haven't money, the part when John Q., says ""if you won $75 million in surgeries, why you don't make one of good will?"" The Money, the money is the answer, but don't the doctors maybe have remorses of conscience?, will they be as miserable as to allow to die to somebody that only needs of their help to stop to charge their pay? why they not only make the operation and later do see as the patient or the relatives he/she pays them? I understand that to make that is not always profitable for the hospital or clinic, but they should have political in this respect, that passes here in Venezuela, but nothing else in Clinical, because the hospitals, although the resources are scarce and they are very not well organized and all that there is, poor people are made their operations, although the medical care here is quite inefficient, and many people in a room of emergencies they stay almost expecting an eternity so that they assist them.* * Denzel Washington continues being excellent actor and the movie is excellent, my vote is 9/10 * *",John Q
118,dmbjam29,What's More Surprising?,2,30 January 2007,"What's more surprising about this movie, the fact that it was so awful, or that so many great actors got roped into this Hollywood babble?The movie is about a father, John Archibald (Denzel Washington) who goes to extreme measures after his young son has a heart failure. After being rejected by their insurance company and the hospital, Archibald decides to hold the hospital hostage so that his son can be saved.I felt like I was being preached to and being force-fed immature stereotypes, that doctors are soulless puppets for insurance companies, that insurance companies are evils, that health care should be universal, that cops are incapable and stupid, blah blah blah. The problem is that instead of showing us the moral of the story through a mature combination of cinematography, acting, set design and dialog, screenwriter James Kearns forces the garbage down our throats as the characters in the room babble their views for two hours. Not even the tremendous acting of Denzel Washington could save this movie.The most thrilling aspect was that so many great actors (Washington, Liotta, Woods, Duvall) were in this movie. The film desperately tries to show the duality of life and tries to answer the question how one life is worth compared to another, but its done so immaturely that it's baffling. The movie proves that even with an all-star cast, a poor script and poor directing can ruin the whole thing. Waste of time.2 out of 10",John Q

Denzel's acting in this film is predictable... and by that I mean that it is typical Denzel Washinton, superb, overwhelming and beautiful. He really knows how get into the characters he plays, James Woods is not a bad addition to this either, those two actors in this one film and with such a touching and dramatic story that will most- likely have everyone in the audience weeping with such emotion that this film provokes.

But, I came out feeling very, very unsatisfied, feeling like the movie played me for a fool.Why? you may ask? Well, This flick seems a good movie for ""entertainment value"" but, it's a sappy and shallow as a old chicken grease filled coffee can. Now, you see... a movie can be sappy and work well... (with a good script) even a shallow movie can work (if you got some stuff blowing up in it) but, this movie has neither... and ultimatley, my feeling is that it's too shallow and makes fun of itself too much to much to be serious and it's too serious to be a complete satire of as you may have been hearing about the American HMO system.So, to sum it all up... the movie is good because of the performances of the entire Archibald family (Denzel, Ms. Elise, and the adorable son) (also, The song (by stevie wonder???) proceeding the son's fall along with the images definatley pulls at your heart strings.)BUT...The movie fails in it's scripting departments",John Q

The masses filed out of the theatre amid discussions of those damnable HMO's.I did not hear mention of the lengthy regulations imposed by the US government on the Medical industry in the film, nor did I hear mention of the very broad interpretation of malpractice defined by US government, prompting doctors to form corporations just to cover the insurance premiums.
Given the US governments botch job of student visas after the September 11th acts of war (as well as other botch jobs), should anyone honestly believe that same government would make better the health system?Yeah the healthcare system is a mess but it is much better than having some administrator in Washington DC dictate the health needs of Portland Oregon.

I was surprised about how this movie was good and emotional overall. Denzel Washington is very convincing in his role of father who is fighting for his son's life. And may others stars appears here, which is second best by Robert Duvall in role of the mature cop. I didn't liked Ray Liotta very much because he doesn't fit somehow. James Woods was sympathetic in role of non emotional doctor.I wondering in the half of the movie, what the opening scene have with the rest of the movie and the plot. And then I realized suddenly. Woman who had an accident in opening scene will donate the heart to the young boy. I think that this is very intelligent detail of the movie.I also noticed that this movie has a lots of similarities with the old classic movie Dog Day Afternoon with Al Pacino in main role. Both movies are about negotiating about some service with the cops in the closed building. In Dog Day Afternoon it was bank, in John Q it was hospital. In one there was money in case, in other there was free heart for surgery. This movie among the lots of emotions also contains a lot of high tension scenes, like a sniper shot from ventilation or when John attempted to kill self and many others. It is typical end of this movie and I'm really satisfied about the end of the movie. I'm found to be very glad because it is not sad like I was expect it will be.Many dislike this movies because it is critic about 'American Health Insurance'. I'm not American, I'm from Europe and I know that this movie is base on real health status in America. Familiar Michael Moore create a documentary about it and it's for sure that in America over 50 000 millions of people don't have the health insurance.OK, that was a little bit off topic.

I was suprised by the number of people who were fooled by this piece of propaganda on IMDB.  Those of you who think the government should run our health care system, look at the tax rates of the countries who do.

John is poor but he is happily married to Denise(Kimberly Elise) and has raised a good son, Mike(very well played by ten-year-old Daniel E. Smith). But when it turns out Mike needs a hearttransplant within a few days or else he will die, John holds several hostages captive and says that he'll let them go when hospital director Rebecca Payne(Anne Heche), puts Mike on the list for a transplant. While also he must face Police Lieutenant Frank Grimes(Robert Duvall).I think James Woods gives the Best performance in the film, as cardiologist, Raymond Turner, who is one of John's hostages. Some people might not be so moved by it because the love between a father and a son that is shown in the film is a very common thing. But what is extremely moving about the film is John's courage.

The criticism expressed towards this movie on the part of some is missing the entire point however, and that is the fundamental weakness of the so-called U.S. health care system. A system that sees more than 40 million people without health insurance, and a great deal many more with insufficient coverage for such procedures as heart transplants. We don't hear of people going out and hijacking emergency rooms every day of course, but we do hear stories of families forced to sell practically everything they own in order to cover hospital costs for unforseen catastrophic events. A system driven purely by profit without regard for human compassion is a system badly in need of reform and this movie does a good job of bringing the spotlight on one of the most controversial issues facing the American public and politicians today.**** out of *****",John Q

131,jasonw-5,You will love this film but be prepared for the many melodramatic moments.,7,14 February 2002,"3 out of 4`How's it going to end John?'`I don't know.'This exchange more than sums up what could be called the most emotional film of 2002.  John Quincy Archibald (Denzel Washington) is a dedicated father and blue-collar factory man who can't make ends meet.  Following his 9-year-old son's collapse at a baseball game it becomes clear that he will die without a heart transplant.  Unfortunately, John's insurance isn't adequate enough and the hospital is sending his son home to die.  For John this situation is unacceptable, forcing him to take the hospital's Emergency Room, including his son's cardiac surgeon (James Woods), hostage until his son is placed at the top of the waiting list for new hearts.
From the very beginning, the film is an up-and-down ride of emotions.  An honest and hard working family is faced with more heartache than anyone could ever imagine yet I believed every scene.  The filmmaker succeeds with his intention even though it involves perfectly placed, poignant moments meant to resurrect themselves during the final scenes of the film.  Those final scenes will leave you bathed in tears but are sappy and at times a little contrived.  The overall feel of the film, the message it delivers and the cast delivering it far outweigh its small downfalls.
With its ever changing moods `John Q.' places you in the hospital with a wide variety of characters, all coming together to either support John Q. or to fight against the decisions he has made and outside the hospital, where the police and the media battle each other's goals, reminiscent of `Dog Day Afternoon', in their own attempts to end a tragedy that's been set in motion with only the death of a boy, his father or a hostage to stop it.Washington's performance in this film only reinforces the reason he's been nominated five times for an Academy Award.  There is never any doubt that John Q. is willing to risk everything, including his own life, to make sure his son is given a heart transplant. The question that always surfaces when films of this nature are made becomes easy to answer as John Q. explains why it has to happen his way.It may be a given that a film involving bureaucratic HMOs and a hypocritical government system lends itself to preaching and ""John Q."" does become preachy.  But if you're willing to let the message of the film slide off of you, temporarily, what remains is a heartfelt plea from a father to save the one thing that means the most to him, his son's life.",John Q
132,peterbp,Feels like a political piece,2,30 October 2009,"John Q. Archibald: Illinois auto worker, husband and father. Down on his luck; the plant is cutting the shifts, so he is on a 20 hour week, and with the wife working in a cafeteria, making ends meet is tough; John's car is reposessed by the bank because he is behind on the payments. (not enough for both rent and car)From bad to worse as his son, during a junior league baseball game gets a heart attack, and is rushed off to the emergency room.Fast forward: The kid is admitted, and diagnosed with an enlarged heart, and a terminally dropping blood pressure; to survive, he needs a heart transplant. An this is what the movie is about: It's gotta be paid.This is also where the downturn of the movie starts because the plot and characters abruptly turn cardboard at this spot. The hospital cardiac surgeon (using overly complex medical terms that make no sense whatsoever to a layman, in a way i strongly doubt no medical doctor would do) and the hospital director who does a good job of acting like a complete bitch with only her sights on the money in face of a pair of parents that have just had a death sentence on their only child, all while sitting in a fabulous and exquisitely designed and decorated hospital board room.Denzel Washignton is a great actor, have no doubts about that, but if you've seen his other performances (fx. Manchurian Candidate, Pelican Brief, Crimson Tide etc.) you know his mannerisms and style of acting, and while he does a very good attempt at being the desperate father here, he overplays his role in a way that spoils it and adds unreality to the impression.The predicament in short: JQ thinks he has ""Major Medical"" aka PPO, but he doesn't, because his employment is part-time. He ends up counting dollars, from where he can get it; church collection, garage sale of anything worth anything in the house (fridge, colour TV...). And there it goes - the obvious fact is that they just can't make it happen.Cardboard character time: JQ's wife goes hysterical and tells him to DO SOMETHING to save the son. So he does it, and takes a pistol to the emergency room of the Hope Memorial Hospital (which could be any of the 7 in central Chicago, anyway.).The latter half of the movie is not much worth going into detail, because it is boilerplate hostage situation in the context of the movie; a bit of chitchat about the nasty HMO's paying doctors not to check for illness, drama between the hostages, and once in a while the continually death clock of the dying son's lowered blood pressure.Hostage negotiator comes in, starts taking, police chief comes in, makes it abundantly clear that he is only there for show and because it's election year, and, you can guess the rest.It's stuff you've seen before, done better, all of it. A particularly bothersome foolishness of the movie is that the kid, with terminally low blood pressure and barely hanging on to consciousness (if at all), has no trouble talking to his father (though in a whisper voice) in fully formed sentences that you expect from an adult, not from an intubated kid on the verge of death! This is emotional pornography of a particularly poor sort.Long story short, it ends good, yada yada yada. Absolute run of the mill drama with nothing worthy of note apart from the political message, which comes here: YOU NEED UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE It's not me telling you this, it's the movie telling it to you.. no, it's screaming it at you; it's like having a billboard with HUGE LETTER SHOVED IN YOUR FACE telling you.What spoils this motion picture isn't as much the standardized plot and dialogue, or the overly melodramatical acting, no, it is the almost constant overtones of a political piece.I won't go into the political jabbering here, but I will throw a brief comment on the subject; the US medical system certainly has its flaws, but making a otherwise tear-laden family drama into a political propaganda delivery system is unbelievably cheap, and not helped by actual political figures being included (probably why most good movies use generic political figures, such as US Presidents not being named, but just being 'Mr. President' etc.); as mentioned above, just before JQ gets his car reposessed, George Bush is on the tube (looking somewhat indifferent to the plight of working poor Americans), and after the movie ends, lots of footage of protesters carrying ""free healthcare"" etc etc. slogan signs are shown, and none other than Hillary Clinton is displayed prominently as the Universal Healthcare savior of sorts. (If you *must* ask , I care not for either of mentioned politicians or their parties. There, i said it.).Another reviewer said that this is the writer's ""letter to the editor"" on his disagreements with US healthcare. On consideration, he is absolutely right; this isn't drama as much as it is a political propaganda piece that uses a deep and true contemporary problem in US society as a launchpad, and on considering that, I feel nauseous I've spent my time watching this garbage, so blatantly exploiting the human misery of an actual, real problem for some with such an obvious goal.Summarizing: Polished and great cast, but bland from the standard plot, acting and dialogue, and destroyed by the political payload it carries.Additionally, I noticed that most of the negative comments on this movie has been rated down a lot, while positive commentary is almost uniformly rated up. Why is that?",John Q
133,misteme2003,"Intense drama, great acting, a powerful movie *SPOILERS*",8,24 October 2004,"I can't understand anyone watching this movie and not liking it. Denzel Washington is fabulous as a father who will stop at nothing to save his child. Anne Heche is superb as the cold, formal hospital administrator who lives by the attitude ""this is a business"". This is a movie that has 2 themes. One is about the love of a parent for a child, the other is about the ""business"" of health care. Both are equally powerful themes. One will ask themselves, if a parent, would they not do the same thing if their child was gravely ill??? What would one stop at to save their child?? One will also ask, what kind of a health care system do we have in the good 'ol USA to allow something like this to happen (not based on a true story, but could very well happen, as a nurse, I can attest to this). The role was made for Denzel, he aced it. Ray Liotta is great too, but underused. I would have liked to see him in Duvall's role instead..but nonetheless, the three of them, were convincing. This movie is worth watching not only for the fantastic acting, but the message it sends. More people need to see it to become better educated health care consumers and familiarize themselves with what health care in this country is all about $$$...that said...it is a powerful movie, very intense because of the emotions it brings to the surface. Watch it, you won't be disappointed 8/10*. (Grab some tissues too, and if you can, watch the special features on the DVD to learn a little)",John Q
134,mashby,"Unfortunately, John Q goes for the easy cliche almost every time.",3,22 April 2003,"I delayed watching this movie from the simple fact that the previews gave me the impression that this was a ""squashed squirrel."" There are two ways to elicit emotion: 1) provide a cliche device, such as a squashed squirrel (who won't go ""awwww"" when seeing a small animal hurt?), or 2) earn your audience emotions by providing them with honest writing and believable situations. Unfortunately, John Q goes for the easy cliche almost every time.Denzel Washington is an excellent actor and try as he might, he simply can't escape from the script. At every turn he's handed another maudlin easy out. And that's really a shame because the topic addresses some fairly tough questions. There was real opportunity to provide a rich story filled with interesting dialog regarding the U.S healthcare system. Instead we're presented with stereotypes of the ""rich doctor,"" the ""mean hospital administrator"" and the ""gung ho cop."" Been there, done that and I didn't care to see it the first time.Major talent is wasted as well. Robert Duvall's character, Lt. Frank Grimes, doesn't have enough material to even be effective as cast member. At the end of the movie, I was left wondering why we even needed his character - he had no arc and provided no real insight to the drama. Duvall is a fantastic character actor and he's given nothing to work with.The rest of the cast is mostly a mixed bag of good and bad. All Kimberly Elise can do is play anger as Denise Archibald, John's wife. Her performance was disappointing since her character had the most to work with. James Woods and Anne Heche can likewise do little in their roles than play the stereotypes that they've been given. However Eddie Griffin did standout as one of the more honest characters as Lester Matthews, one of the hostages. Granted, his role didn't require much of a stretch, but it was a breath of fresh air and one of the few redeeming elements of the movie.The bottom line is that James Kearns, the writer and co-producer, simply provided nothing but a sow's ear to the cast and no amount of magic was going to turn it into a silk purse. Kearns' work may have been appropriate for ""Jake and the Fatman"", or ""Highway to Heaven"", (he wrote for both TV series), but it simply wasn't up to snuff for the cadre of talent on the playbill.",John Q
135,DaDrill,Hmmm,3,23 February 2002,"Originally I thought that the movie was good.  After thinking about it, the cops can't possibly be that inept. A heart transplant doesn't just happen with a doctor who has been held hostage for hours with a minimal surgical team. Anne Heche doesn't look like an administrator of a hospital that grosses hundreds of millions every year, and her wardrobe? Yuck! Denzel does a super job as usual, and some of the supporting cast is good, but most roles are shallow. I was most disappointed with Robert Duvall's role.  Such a waste of dialogue for a talented actor. One or two good scenes and Washington's performance make this predictable tale worth seeing once.",John Q

It's also disturbing to hear howe much the transplant costs in the film and actually scares people to think about that in real life wiht no coverage at all. this was overall a good movie that i think should actually deliver a message to the world to bring more responsible coverage and the states to be more supportive if necessary. I was actually breathless and shaking when they told the archibalds the down payment of 75,000, now hardly anyone can ever get that type of money easily at all, unless they were rich and only 20% of the people around this world i say are rich, about 60% moderate, and 20% poor.

Smith, Anne Heche, and James WoodsPlot:  When a 9 year old boy (Daniel E. Smith) needs a heart transplant to live that his parents can't afford, his father (Denzel Washington) takes an ER hostage.""John Q"" is a very brilliant film.  I can't wait for the DVD.  Though it is pretty much an insured hit, it sure earned the money it is making right now. Denzel Washington is brilliant as the father, it is almost an alter-ego to Alonzo Harris, the character he played in ""Training Day"".  While Harris likes to corrupt the system, John Q. Archibald tries to make the system better.  This movie is almost a message to health care providers, a plead for better health care for the millions of Americans who have poor or no health care.The other actors do brilliant jobs.  Kimberly Elise is brilliant as the worried mother, and Daniel E. Smith was very brilliant in his first role as the son, the wonderfully innocent Mikey Archibald.  Anne Heche is a cold being in this movie, playing the head of the hospital, who denies an operation until the Archibalds can get them the money needed.  James Woods is another cold being as a doctor.  The hostages are brilliant in their roles.  Eddie Griffin is a stereotypical black man from the urban streets. Sean Hatosy is a wife beating trailer trash punk, and Heather Wahlquist is hisgirlfriend.  There are more hostages, all playing a brilliant and important role in this sentimental film.John Q is portrayed as a hero in this film, a father who will go to any lengths to save his son.  He is portrayed as a nice guy, an innocent father, while the hospital and insurance agency are portrayed as the bad guys, so you can see from what viewpoint this film was made from.  This does not matter though.  My grandmother cried during the film, and the whole audience in the theater enjoyed it.Overall I would like to reccomend this brilliantly composed film.  Though the maturity level might limit this film to teenagers and older, it is still a brilliant film that I reccomend to everyone.Grade: A- or 9 out of 10",John Q

All it does is portray the love of a father for his ailing son and shows the extent to which he is willing to go to get his son back to normal health. There are many loopholes in the story but the portrayal of Denzel Washington as the cornered father whose son needs a heart transplant immediately, but is not able to financially support the huge costs, covers up all those gaps! One of the best performances of Denzel Washington. The song during the final credits, 'The voice inside my heart' is superb and truly makes so much sense after the movie.To provide for his ailing son he takes the emergency room of the same hospital hostage. Only later to made a tough decision to give up his life so that his son can have his heart. The presence of Robert Duvall too is very electrifying. Indeed great actors! Here's the part where the father makes the decision to die so that his son can have his heart.This sort of courage and determination to go to any length does not come easy. At times it sounds insane and beyond logic or reason. Yet that's the love of a parent. A father and mother know no bounds when it comes to their child.http://www.vcastilino.blogspot.in/",John Q
141,Cactus-7,This film NEEDS a doctor,2,5 May 2003,"As the recipient of a kidney transplant, I was not really surprised to see that almost nothing about this film was accurate. The whole phony plot line that a hospital wouldn't perform a heart transplant on Washington's son until he raised thousands of dollars should tip most people off. If a patient can't afford an organ transplant, Medicare will pay for it. Likewise the idea that a perfect donor match would become available within 24 hours is almost too laughable to contemplate. Most transplant patients wait a minimum of two to three years for their donor organ. You don't receive an organ because your dad is holding the ER hostage; you receive it after you've been on the UNOS list long enough to accumulate a certain amount of points. You also have to wait until a suitable tissue match is available. Organ transplantation is an extremely complicated process and this film could have done a lot to educate people as to the lack of donor organs in this country. Instead, it was a ridiculous play for a national health care program. If you like the Postal Service, you'll love nationalized health care.",John Q
142,mcs2k,"Begins wretchedly, ends predictably...",5,20 July 2002,"Right off the bat my biggest complaint is the lack of character development before the crisis strikes the family.  John and wife are crying at their son's bad news, but the first several scenes are so poorly acted, that no empathy is felt for them.
----------***spoiler alert***-----Honestly, the ending was terribly predictable.  You know that the intro sequence of the woman weaving in and out of lanes would be required to hold some bearing on the story.  It's ridiculous to think otherwise.  The movie's hostage situation degenerates by turn John Q. into a hero.  We must ignore the fact that he shut down one of the cities busiest hospitals deflecting patients into other undoubtedly crowded emergency rooms.  Denzel does give an above average performance in the second half, but this movie didn't move me in the slightest.  Another complaint I have is with the fake looking operation.  It didn't look real at all.

The film shows this situation up very well, The acting was first rate and the film in the end is a very worthy effort.

144,pmforster,Exploring moral dilemmas,8,9 June 2002,"I teach an undergraduate course in Child Development. During the course we look at children's moral development and particularly focus on the work of Kohlberg and his 'Heinz' dilemma. The dilemma concerns a man whose wife is ill and needs a particular drug to survive. The chemist who makes the drug is asking a price that Heinz cannot afford and so he breaks into the chemist's shop and steals the drug. Kohlberg determined children's level of moral development from the kind of answers they give to the question, ""Was Heinz wrong to steal the drug."" The youngest children usually say yes he was wrong - stealing is always wrong. As they get older they bring more factors into the equation and will often say that he was not wrong because human life is more important.At the heart of the movie 'John Q' is a very similar moral dilemma presented in a thoughtful and sympathetic way. I give this move 8/10 for its treatment of an issue that is well worth thinking about.BTW, on a 'Health and Community Psychology' course I also teach, most students see the US American health system as too deeply flawed to be a model other countries should adopt. The reasons why are also well set out in this movie.",John Q
145,katyggls,Good Film,7,7 June 2005,"John Q., starring Denzel Washington, who is one of the finest actors around.I really liked this movie. I thought it especially interesting that John Q. (as in John Q. Public) and his family are African-Americans. I think that the director wanted to challenge the audience's perception of the average American family. Admit it, unless you are a member of a minority group, when someone says ""American family"", you probably think of a white family with 2.5 kids, a picket fence, and maybe a dog. I know I do. But I enjoy having my perceptions turned on end. The only potential problem I have with this movie is that I don't know if all the circumstances of the movie are based in reality or not. For example, in the movie, the hospital informs John Q. that his son needs a heart transplant to save his life, but that heart transplant surgery is ""elective"" and so they can't proceed or even put him on the organ donor's list until they receive $75,000 as a down payment. Now I said this was a potential problem because I don't know if this is true or not. If it is, than I have no problem, (other than the fact that I am appalled at our health care system), but if it isn't true, than the movie may be guilty of a little bit of emotional manipulation. But even if that's the case, it's still a great movie that has a lot to say about the health care system in this country. It takes a look at the issue from many aspects, including the effects of HMO's and so-called ""managed care"" health plans to the fact that hospitals are now in the business of making money instead of curing patients. The end of the movie crosses dangerously into sentimentality, but there's enough substance here to keep us from rolling our eyes. All in all a worthy effort.",John Q

Otherwise, it was almost laughable to see how cold and heartless doctors and hospital administrators were portrayed.

How could anyone take seriously a film featuring the unbelievable antics of the TV reporter?  And hostage negotiations?  What a laugh they were!  Ray Liotta, as the police chief, was a joke.

The rating for this movie just confirmed that theory.

153,kevinmanf,Weak screenplay reduces a noble film into an insulting gallery of emotional and dramatic simplicity,4,5 March 2006,"""John Q"" takes on an issue that is as serious as necessary: the lack of a national health insurance in the American health system, where the health of citizens is left on the hands of the insurance companies that treat people who need medical attention like a business. Despite the great possibilities this issue offers for a film, the screenplay does not know how to convey it and instead makes ""John Q"" what it is: an overwritten and over dramatized film. A gallery of forced and artificial situations. A film that is insultingly simplistic in the way it conveys its themes and ultimately, a collection of the most pathetic Hollywood clichés. All this under a cinematography that is dramatically mundane.Once Denzel Washington's character has taken a hospital's emergency room hostage we have the hostages supporting his cause and later on, a crowd standing outside the hospital cheering at John Q's cause whilst the police are treated like the bad guys. Can a drama be more unrealistic than this? Contrieved and artificial to me. I am aware that in real life it is possible to have people who supported Jon Q's acts but the way the film shows it only serves to hero worship his persona and take away the realism. In a lot of movies the characters are easy to describe. Take for example Washington's character Alonzo Harris in ""Training Day"". He is a stereotype, the embodiment of a corrupt police officer who does things by his own methods. But the difference between a character like Alonzo Harris and the ones in this film is that whilst Harris is a stereotype, he does not seem like one whereas in ""John Q"" everybody is portrayed as a stereotype due to the screenplay's insulting simplicity in its dialogue. John Q the good father forced to take justice on his own hands, Rebecca Payne (Anne Heche) the medical director with no heart, Robert Duvall the detective who sympathises with John Q's plight and on the other side Gus Monroe (Ray Liotta), the police officer with no sympathy who feels Q should be eliminated without further negotiation and on and on... Consider dialogue like ""I'm not going to bury my son! my son is going to bury me!"" Sure it sounds good but it also deems the film as totally contrived and again, far too simplistic with little regard for the audiences intelligence. The screenplay should have done the more challenging and better thing of allowing us to judge John Q on our own rather than telling us what to think of him and giving little argument from the opposition's voice (those that are not capable of seeing a lack of a national health insurance as an injustice). The film also tries to deal with the sensationalism in the media when tragic events occurs but it's focus is too thin and lacks conviction.As a thriller it is a poor and predictable one where when a scene is just getting interesting, the screenplay adds a situation, a dialogue or a character that is pathetic. Denzel Washington does a wonderful job but I was kind of uneasy when I asked myself: how could he accept to lend his enormous talent to such a weak screenplay? The performances can not be criticised but the characters all seem to be what they are: supporting actors supporting Washington. In the end ""John Q"" is a noble attempt to denounce a social injustice. It just lacks the skill to do this correctly.",John Q

159,Evil_Will_Hunting,this is a review of John Q,3,10 December 2002,"2 out of 10This is a review of `John Q.'  I said, this is a review of `John Q.'  It is very important that you understand that this is a review of `John Q.'  If I keep telling you that this is a review of `John Q' I think eventually you will realize that this is a review of `John Q.'I'm sorry if I'm being a tad, say, didactic, but I have just spent the last two hours of my life, two hours I can never get back, watching `John Q,' the movie I am now going to review.Don't get me wrong.  It's not that the premise or the message of the film are flawed-that of a father taking a hospital hostage in order to get his son on the list to receive a heart transplant-but the delivery is about as subtle as an open heart surgery, as deliberate as an entrepreneur at the Olympics, and as believable as an Oscar nomination.Consider a scene in which the surgeon-who could have been played by anybody but is played by James Woods because this is a movie-tells Denzel Washington's character that `the only way to save his son is to get a heart transplant,' and his evil-yet-eventually-has-a-change-of-heart-so-the-movie-can-have-a-happy-end ing assistant-who also could have been played by anyone, but is played by Anne Heche because otherwise she would have taken the life of one of the hostages inside her mind every hour-responds roughly, `you do have one more option-you can let your son DIE!!!'Washington's performance is pretty much the only saving grace of the film, though at times I can't help but wonder if the emotions he shows are from the pain of seeing his character's son nearly die, or from being trapped in such a piece of schlock as is this film, or from seeing his character's son nearly die in such a piece of schlock as is this film.There is a good movie in here somewhere, and it was called `The Negotiator.' Not that that film had the market cornered on hostage negotiation or even that `John Q' is all that similar to `The Negotiator;' it's just that my boss Jason at work told me to say that and we're up for raises soon and . ..But seriously, all I ask of a film is that it take an interesting premise and explore the possibilities that come from it.  `John Q' does not concern itself with this, because its primary purpose is to preach from Hollywood to the supposed `movie-going' branch of the government as to the necessity of free health care for all.  Washington's character doesn't actually take the hospital hostage; he merely locks the doors to the emergency room so the people there, naturally representing all walks of life, can have discussions about HMOs and how greedy doctors are.  Outside the evil media and government are represented by a parade of extras dressed as policemen pointing guns at the fake wall to the hospital while Ray Liotta and Robert Duvall spout rehashed cop banter at each other against a backdrop of cheering patrons.  Say, isn't it convenient when the film's focal point is a mass media event?Of course the people are cheering on John Q. Archibald, who is meant to represent John Q. Public.  Get it?  John Q?  Everyman?  Yeah that's pretty clever . . . Mr. President.  And we the lower classes are oppressed.  Boo hoo.  Why doesn't somebody make a movie about how I can't find a damn parking spot anywhere?It's probable that John Q.

Bitter Movie Critic Who Pans All the Films You Like Just to Get Revenge on All the Girls That Rejected Him in High School, but inasmuch as these people won't be smart enough to make any sort of a difference on even a grassroots level, the film fails yet again.If there truly is a problem with the health care system in this country as it is, I certainly didn't gather as much from this film.  The filmmakers would have been wise to model `John Q' more after `Traffic,' a film that showed all the sides of a problem without demonizing any of its characters, after `The Negotiator,' a film I have mentioned twice already in this review, or after `Mission: Impossible II,' a film that features Tom Cruise dangling from the side of a cliff.

I don't know about you, but I think too many people here on IMDb are too picky, and too strict when it comes to reviews. But that's just my opinion. This movie has a great script, great actors (Denzel Washington, James Woods, Robert Duvall, Ray Liotta, etc) and I thought it was directed very well. The movie really brought out the sensitive side in me. Tears of sadness and happiness. I really connected to this movie as I live in a poor family, and we struggle for things, and much like John Q, I feel like this Country is so messed up, I just wan't to really take things into my own hands. So, ok .. this movie is superb, I highly suggest it, as it receives a very solid 9/10 from myself.",John Q
161,aorourke55,Health Care for Dummies,1,4 April 2005,"This movie was so horrible and biased it almost made HMOs seem sympathetic.Among the dumbest moments: not showing the downside to shutting down a city emergency room for the day, and an outrageously callous hospital administrator who then breaks down and cries over one dying child (so the rest of the ICU patients had all been faking?).But the worst failure was reinforcing the real problem of people just mindlessly complaining about not having open-ended access to health care without any consideration of how to pay for it. The only constructive action was the heart surgeon who waived his fee at the outset but he still got portrayed as a villain apparently for wearing a nice suit.",John Q
162,jonathan-972-150139,"John ""Que the Socialist Handwringing""",5,22 January 2020,"In some ways, this movie surprised me. This was an all-star cast of some really exceptional actors. Ray Liotta, James Woods, Denzel, and Duvall are in a class all their own. The story is compelling enough. The sacrifices the father is prepared to make on behalf of his son are enough to resonate with any parent who loves their children.This main thrust of the story is overshadowed by two grotesquely annoying factors: 1) That when you work for an institution, they have the right to change your health insurance plan without your consent. (They don't, by the way.) 2) There is a tired, worn-out montage of ""bipartisan"" representation at the end of the film telling us that the solution is socialized medicine. This is all well and good, until you've lived through the results of those policies.Before the ACA was enacted into law, you could get what would be considered today a ""Gold PPO"" Plan for seven dollars and change. After it was passed into law, the cost of a plan went through the roof. More companies had higher operating costs through insurance mandates so they had to downsize, and independent people and businesses had to pay penalties if they opted out. Competition evaporated from the marketplace in exchange for single payer, and you could no longer compete for the best plan in the market. I know. I was there.Another HUGE flaw in this film is that it is absolutely, positively, completely against the law to deny someone treatment if they have to go to any ER in this country.So while Bill Maher and Ariana Huffing and Puffington care to virtue signal to everyone about how terrible the healthcare system is, an appropriate message for our times to remember is that ""You get what you pay for."" If an industry can't make money, it can't stay solvent. If it can't stay solvent, the supply of its goods and services will diminish. If that happens, medicine becomes rationed, balkanized, scarce, and astronomically overpriced.There are many things to be improved upon in the healthcare system. Redundancies on your statements, charges for procedures and services you never had being attached to your statements, and the absence of torte reform are all improvements, to be sure. But having Karl Marx M.D. ain't the way.",John Q

If you want agood argument for health care reform, which was the thinly veiledmotivation for the movie with a nod toward gun control, this is notthe movie to see. At every turn it contradicts itself including theironic plea made by one doctor not to take the child to the countyhospital (ie. government run hospital) because a heart transplantwould be considered elective surgery there.

To the meeting with the cardiologist and the hospital administrator.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  I read somewhere that Densel studied factory workers for some time prior to the movie, in order to establish credibility.  He was obviously the only person associated with this movie that put any effort into establishing credibility.The hospital in this movie, does not exist.  Ability to pay isn't even a consideration in determining the recipient of an organ.  Our healthcare system is far from perfect, but it has no similarities to the one featured is this movie.

Sometimes you don't want to have to interpret everything.I thought the characterizations of the little family were so sweet. The trivial spats of everyday life earlier in the film. Later, both parents fighting together, willing to do anything to save the child. Some contrived, but heart-wrenching, moments showing each parent's love for the child. Denzel W. gave a very real performance as the decent, hard-working, blue-collar dad. Yes, he was almost perfect. Yes, the bad people were uniformly bad.

There's a heart transplant scene where the heart is located at the center of the chest (hearts are located on the side btw, usually left), and I don't believe any group of people being held hostage will act the same way as they did in the movie.Sorry Denzel, you can't save this one.",John Q

This is not a movie directed towards winning oscars or accolade, but to motivate people to do something about the health-care situation. The film definitely achieves it desired effect, as it had many people in the theater clapping, crying and praising it. The movie is also careful not to overdose on it's political message by adding comedic scenes. I've also heard a lot about it being cliche and predictable. Now someone please alert me if I am incorrect, but I don't think there has ever been a big budget movie devoted to the cause of nation-wide health-care, and for that matter how many film are devoted to a cause other than money. I disagree with the statement that this is a typical hostage movie. The closest thing I've seen to this was Mad City, but the ending are opposites.

My wife began laughing at this movie about five minutes in and I got mad at her for not giving the movie a chance. Well, I soon joined her. I guess this movie just didn't sink in with me.
It's not that the premise of the movie is that bad. The idea of someone making a movie about health care reform doesn't bother me at all. The thing that bothers me about this movie is that it uses cliche after cliche ad nauseam. Why did the director need to make it a Mack truck in the first scene? Why did the director make the ""bad"" doctor unsympathetic to the world until he was forced to change? Why did Ray Liotta need to be so over-the-top glory hungry? Why was the broadcast journalist the way he was? And the best question of them all, why did Denzel and Robert Duvall waste their time by being in this movie?This movie was just poorly directed, that's what I've decided. You can obviously tell there are some good actors to work with, but much like what George Lucas does with his actors in his films, this director somehow managed to mess things up a little. I felt at times that I was watching an intervention program instead of a movie. I felt bad sitting in the movie with many people who actually enjoyed it.

The problem is that instead of making these points with plot, actions, and emotions, the viewers are beaten over the head with obvious dialogue that sounds completely contrived.  In addition, the messages that the movie tries to pass as revolutionary are infact incredibly old and are insultingly simplified to anyone with a high school education or better!  In short, the movie attempts to be deep and comes up extremely short (somewhere between insulting and retarded).  One final note, on top of my previous complaints the movie is also horribly acted (with the exception of Denzel) and has a ridiculous number of side plots that are also contrived and never go anywhere.

The lesser roles filled by people like Ray Liotta and Shawn Hatosy are right on the mark.Even the educational dialogue on the shortcomings of our health care system worked (for the most part).  The only place it faltered was the occasional slip across the thin line between emotionalism and sappiness.  There was also a somewhat muddled message about the morality of John Q's actions.  He was motivated by a good cause and he and his family have been severely wronged . . . but his actions put others at risk; that was wrong and leads to consequences that must be faced.

Disappointing.,6,12 November 2011,"A heart wrenching potential loss of a son and a beautiful scene about the self sacrifice of a father are well acted and touching. Tear jerking and beautiful.However, the movie ""John Q"" presents multitudes of only positive support for universal health care. The argumentation presented in the movie is myopic, however. I wish to devote my review largely to this incredibly important issue of empathy for others.To claim (and I quote) that ""when someone is sick, they get care"" is just policy is very selfish; if we are to respect each others' lives, freedom, and choices, then we are to respect that if nobody wishes to perform a surgery on you, provide their heart for you, or perform other services for you, then we ought not receive them.Sometimes, life can be difficult. To be fair to others, we have to grow up and embrace our misfortunes rather than turn them into the misfortunes of unknown people around us. The protagonist was an unrealistic character in that he was self sufficient and respectful in the end, but throughout most of the movie performed every behavior to demonstrate that he was selfish and insensitive in his providence for his son. Without this implausible character who is simultaneously both selfish and self sufficient, the movie would have difficulty presenting a moving for armed heart robbery and enslavement of doctors.Don't you DARE ruin others' lives. Look at the big picture. Get angry about John Q's dangerous message of mob rule enslaving the non-majority.

John Q was made to open people's eyes to the misery that is the US Health Care System, a shame on any industrial nation, and possibly the most urgent tragedy of the U.S. . Here in Chile, 17 years of neo-liberal dictatorship left a similar system that leaves 80 percent of the population with no decent health care and money as the main factor of your health options. While the US is spending billions of dollars on getting distant countries to submit, millions of US-citizens are excluded from basic health services. On the other hand, countries such as Sweden show that the ""SICK - HELP"" solidarity principle propagated by John Q is a workable option.Although the movie suffers from many cliches and the story is only so-so, the message it sends makes it far too important and relevant to be ignored.

He takes the hospital on hostage until the doctor agrees to give his son the surgery because they were going to release his son when he paid the hospital 6,000 dollars the day before. He then finds out HMO pays the doctors a bonus check at the end of the year if they find something wrong but the doctors didn't tell the family.I was wondering if he was getting treated like this because he was a black male. Who hadn't had any previous knowledge of medical procedures like this. Since before he took the hospital hostage there was a white family the doctor was joking with and the husband just had the surgery.

193,AaronPK,Typical Hollywood Liberal Propaganda.,1,18 February 2002,"This wasn't a movie, it was a political commercial.  The movie tries to beat our brains to death with the idea that the US should have a national healthcare system.  It's irresponsible to make a movie like this that only tells one side of the issue, and doesn't even get its facts right.  It doesn't mention that in Canada (a country with national healthcare system), cancer treatment is so backwards and out of step that many cancer patients come to the US for treatment.  It doesn't mention how Canada and Great Britain often make patients wait for months before they get an essential surgery.  Also, in Great Britain, the survival rate for cancer patients is much worse.  Government waste, embezzlement, and red tape is crippling the health care systems of these countries.John Q doesn't bother to mention any of this however.  The movie is basically a 2 hour long commercial for socialist democrats.  Anne Heche gets to play the role of the greedy corporate villain, who basically is the representative republican in this movie, though it isn't mentioned.
There's also some tripe about hostages, guns, and more, but that was all done in a far superior film, ""A Dog Day Afternoon"" and I suggest you watch that.If you want to get brainwashed by the Hollywood liberal machine, then John Q is a good choice.

194,spawn777,"Cloying, but very effective tearjerker",9,8 February 2002,"I managed to get into a free screening of this film expecting the worse in Hollywood sentimentality. Instead we got some of the best of Hollywood sentimentality care of the only major star that could pull this off: Denzel Washington. The initial portion of the story was cloying, as it beat you over the head with how downtrodden the family was, but they were careful to point out that cliches are called cliches for a reason; they happen.
Once he takes the hospital, you realize that you have your typical motley band of characters inside the hospital, and the usual suspects outside the hospital. You are aware that this is the usual Hollywood setup, but the pacing is so good, the writing is competent and the casting was done so well, that you are still massively entertained as John Q pleads his case. Eddie Griffin really stands out as a good example of this. It's obvious that he's there for comic relief, but it's heavily implied that he's probably the most sagacious one in the room. And he's written for SO well, that everything he said lit up the crowd.For the first half of this movie, I couldn't believe that Anne Heche would take a role like this, in the current state of her career and public opinion, but as her character progressed (easily the most annoying stock character), it made a little more sense. I did like the usual glory-seeking police chief (Liotta) and wise old negotiator (Duvall) situation. It starts off with the usual and ties up in a little better than the usual way. It was also weird to see Ted Demme on Politically Correct in a commentary on health care in a movie about a kid with a bad heart, right after he passed on due to a heart attack with cocaine in his system. (Call Alanis Morissette)But despite deep casting of talent, this movie is about one thing: DENZEL WASHINGTON. I have always liked him. But in this movie, he is amazing. I realize it's hammy material, and maybe that's easier to get emotionally up for it, but he does it in such a human way, that I just can't imagine anyone else playing the role. Period.The political point of this movie (inadequate health care in this country) was pounded home at the end, but along the way you are really pounded on with emotional moments (not all of them manipulative). I tear up at movies a lot, especially when it comes to father-son moments, but not only did I tear up at least a dozen times in this movie, but I actually found myself wracked with sobs twice. By the time we got to the manipulative crying scene in the hospital, I was out of tears. (I managed to find some for the final scene however [my second wracked moment]). I consider myself a manly man, but I couldn't pretend that ""I had something in my eye"" for the ENTIRE length of the movie!",John Q
195,mhaddad-1,It Doesn't Get Much Better Than This... 10/10... And That Is Coming From An Amateur Film Critic!,10,19 February 2002,"In my opinion, this movie is three things. First it is one of the best movies let alone thrillers to come out ever. Second it is a message to all of the people in the country. And third it is an amazing ensemble of extremely talented actors, many of whom are overlooked and underrated. Let me start out by saying that Denzel's performance, as always, is incredible. In fact the entire casts' performances are incredible, and that is why I choose to include many people in the list of whose starring in this movie. That is also why I feel this is an amazing ensemble of talented actors. Each one of the characters in this movie created their own part in the complicated story of John Q. Some were good, some were bad, and some were funny. But without all of them, there would be one less thing about John Q that made it such a good film. Without certain characters, some of the plot line would be non-existent. When I say this movie is a message to society, I say that because it talks about so many, and bashes so many things that our country is having problems with today. HMO and insurance problems (this was an obvious factor of the movie), problems with the stupidity and eagerness of the media (Tuck Lampley the TV reporter called the fact that he got video footage of John Q his `white bronco' and he didn't even care what was going on.typical of today's media), problems with people being mean and beating up their girlfriends (Mitch), problems within the police department (Monroe the police chief talking about elections, and wanting this to get over with so just kill him. He didn't care about John Q or his son.) In my opinion it took a lot of guts for Nick Cassavetes, and James Kearns (writer) to make a movie about these horrible, horrible things that happen. This movie tells people that these problems happen, and basically asks, what should we do about it?Lastly, in my opinion this is one of the best movies let alone thrillers to come out ever. The cast and crew of this movie took many problems that are going on now, took amazing actors, and made this into a tense, sometimes funny, and extremely important movie. At some times I was scared to death, and at some times I couldn't stop laughing. This truly was a great, great movie. Ok, so maybe not everybody will like this movie. Maybe they will say it's too much of a message, and not enough of a movie. But it being a message and still being an incredible movie, in my opinion, is one of the greatest cinematic feats of all time. Kudos to the entire cast and crew of John Q!10/10",John Q
196,scclay74,Excellence!,10,3 March 2002,"John Q is a movie about a father trying to save his son, his only son!  It is superb.  I found the characters to be believable.  No, I don't think a father would actually hold his son's doctor hostage to try and save him, that would require real MEN and real FATHER'S to exist in this country, but I thought the concept was excellent.  Nick Cassavetes surprised me in his direction of this film.  It was great.  As a survivor of an HMO fiasco, I can relate to the trauma experienced by John Q and his wife.  Again, this movie was... EXCELLENCE!",John Q

198,sheycavin,"Suspenseful, but cheap.",5,18 February 2002,"I saw John Q Saturday night.  Not what I expected.  Had I wanted to know more about socialized medicine, I would have read the brochure.  Instead, the writer of this movie read the brochure for me and encapsulated it in an emergency room scene in which the ""hostages"" discuss the woes of health insurance in America.  An extremely unnatural and preachy scene, to say the least.Also, this movie doesn't really tackle the issue of Americans not donating organs.  It makes it seem that the reason people die waiting for transplants is because big mean insurance companies won't pay for them.  When in fact, more often than not, it's because a compatible donor is never located.
SPOILERS in this paragraph.  The movie is filled with tear-jerking, emotion-manipulating, cheap suspense scenes.  The gun's safety being on when he lies down to kill himself at the end is possibly the cheapest bit of writing a I've seen in a movie of this budget.  The movie leads you to believe that he killed himself just as the news of his son's new heart arrives.  My first thought was, ""That's awesome.  This movie is truly a tragedy.""  But no.  He's alive.  Hollywood, no matter how brash a political statement they are trying to make, will not kill a star.  His son has a new heart and is up walking around and flexing for his dad (ala John John's salute to his father in 1963) a few months after the operation.  Good old John Q gets a couple of years in jail.  Violence is the answer once again. The movie never mentions the various charities that help people raise the money for transplants of this nature.  And are we to believe the news agencies wouldn't run a story like this?  Would a little boy broke and dying and in need of a heart transplant not pull in ratings unless his father holds an ER hostage?All in all, I think the makers of this film had the best of intentions. But to blow an opportunity to bring attention to the need for organ donors in this country is a crime.  And while films like ""Cider House Rules"" and ""Traffic"" address social issues, they don't tell which side you should be on.  Our government has been known to spend $50 on hammers and $300 on toilets.  Do we really want them running our hospitals?  Isn't $15 enough to pay for an aspirin?I give it a C because the acting is great and some of the suspense is genuine.",John Q
199,Andrew_321,"Mildly entertaining, but falls short",3,24 February 2002,"I must admit, the premise of this movie is great.  John Q Archibald, a loving father, has his love for his son tested when he cannot get a heart transplant.  Just how far will he go to save his son?This is the question that John Q asks.  This situation is really heartbreaking, and it could have been a truly great movie.  Sadly, the film never managed to even take itself seriously, so how can the audience be expected to?(possible spoilers) The filmmakers go to great lenghts to make sure we like John Q: he is portrayed as a hardworking family man.  A scene of him in church immediately followed by a Little League game closes the deal; look how average he is! When his son has a heart attack, he is rushed to the hospital and told that his son needs a heart transplant.  At this stage of the story a whole new lineup of characters is introduced, each a cardboard cutout from a host of other movies: the heartless hospital staff, the richboy doctor, etc.Despite the filmmaker's desperate attempts to get the audience to sympathize with John Q's plight, it just didn't work for me.  No situation was original or true; they all seemed to refer to other movies.  As I was watching, I kept thinking: ""Haven't we seen this before?""These early weaknesses become blatant as the movie moves into its last act. John Q, desperate to save his son, takes the hospital hostage to negotiate for a new heart.  The Hollywood formula for hostage situations is carefully followed: good cop, bad cop, meddling reporter, list of hostages from every walk of life.  We've seen all this before in other movies, and it was always handled much better.  Consider the scene in which one of the hostages tells another his plan for escape.  Not only is this exchange completely unrealistic, it is completely unneeded.  A better movie would have shown him pocketing the weapons and leaving us to figure it out, but the filmmakers didn't give us credit for any intelligence whatsoever.Another problem is the endless preaching.  Hostages sit around with John and discuss HMOs and health care as if they were highly educated on the topic. People, not only is this completely sickening, it just doesn't happen. Consider the following dialogue:""There are over 50 million people in the United States without health insurance.  If you've got a problem with it, call your congressman.""As if we didn't hear enough politics in our last presidential election! My friends dragged me to this movie on opening night, and all I could do was shake my head at how they praised it shamelessly.  People, we know better",John Q

201,rcrca2,A morality tale,7,20 July 2002,"This film is an archetypal morality tale. The bad guys and the good guys are two-dimensional. The plot devolves from a young child urgently requiring a new heart, while the hospital and insurance authorities are heartless. Hospital administrator Rebecca Payne (Anne Heche) gives a Cruela DeVil-lanous performance. The heart surgeon (James Woods) must have ice sludging through his veins.Denzel Washington (John Q. Archibald) is, good, so good it is hard to believe he could really snap to such a degree.  Conversely, could those mavens of Mammon truly have such--pardon the expression--change of heart at story's end?The Archibalds are slowly losing their shirts, but even so, their lifestyle would look good to most Third World denizens.   Indeed, however, events belie the apparent apple-pie order of their universe. In this Garden of Eden, there is a serpent called the HMO, and the hero has been poisoned by its fangs.  The contrast between the gleaming  hospital and its shabby, profit-oriented medical ethos is glaring.There is even a Greek chorus: onlookers outside the hospital cheer and boo as events dictate. But suspense remains high, and although we know we have been manipulated, it is in such a good cause that by movie's end we feel vindicated. We even feel like applauding. If only real life could be like that.  Therein lies the value of the tale.",John Q

I don't care if there's supposed to be a 'greater good' in all this because the ends do not justify the means.Of course, if it doesn't fall within their own political point of view, then they'd probably abhor those actions done by individuals and groups who don't share their social agenda. In other words it's more of the same; ""my 'freedom fighter' is better than your 'terrorist'"" garbage.How pathetic and sad it is that some viewers of this film have political blinders on and support criminal actions in order to make a point.Grade: F",John Q
203,beatrizmarijuan,Wasted potential to deliver a strong message,1,6 December 2020,"I thought it was all very cliché and plain, it was overly emotional and still I wasn't able to be emotionally involved with the story or characters.
The turning points of the story were either predictable or laughable (i.e. the police shooter falling from the ceiling).
And I can't understand how a movie of this budget did such little research in the medical aspects of the plot, given it's the major theme.
I quite like the basic idea of the movie but I personally think the development is so poor it's left with little backbone.",John Q
204,thogatthog,"Overall, a fine movie",10,9 February 2003,"One can't help feeling that a lot of the negative reviews of this movie have been sponsored by the HMOs or others with a vested interest in the current healthcare system. One can pick small holes in the movie -- for example, Liotta's play-it-for-the-cameras police chief is hamfistedly stereotyped -- but overall this is a story that had to be told and is told well. The performances by Washington, Elise, Woods and Duvall are astonishing -- full of subtleties (that may be _too_ subtle for some viewers to catch) yet, in the case of Washington and one's tempted to say particularly in the case of Elise, also full of power. If you honestly think the healthcare system in this country is perfect you'll hate this movie, because it'll rattle your convictions. Anyone else will be given much food for thought.",John Q

She was so evil.  Even the boy that played John Q's son was great.  The film was almost a tear jerker for me, I had to hold them back.Despite the liberal lean to the movie it was still great.  The movie seems to be pushing too hard for a national health care system.  I saw two versions of this film, and the first version had a lot of liberal mumbo jumbo at the end talking about how many Americans don't have insurance and how many can't afford it and how we need a national health care system. But the final version they removed all that.  I guess they didn't want to make all republicans mad about that.But don't worry about the political messages in the film.  Go see this movie!",John Q

In my opinion John Q is a story that everybody should watch, about a man who has no alternative but to outrun himself. The excellent acting of my favorite actor (Denzel Washington) makes you cry even if you don't use to cry at movies. John Quincy Archibald is a role-model of a human being with the same inner strength like Rubin ""The Hurricane"" Carter (also a personage in another movie of Denzel). This movie will make everyone of you to be a better man with stronger moral principles and more kind.

Yes, John Q is filled with cliches, has a certain made-for-TV feel to it, and isn't going to win any Oscars. So what? It's enjoyable, entertaining, and walks the fine line between delivering a message and being preachy with grace and balance. Quite frankly, that's what I paid $7 for in the first place, not to be impressed by how well a film caters to a critic's narrow view of what the rest of the world should be watching.",John Q

But the holes in the film aside this movie was carried by absolutely brilliant performances by Denzel Washington and Robert Duvall. Possibly Denzel's best acting yet. Also incredible was the young actor DFaniel E Smith who played Denzel's son in the film.

She has a rosary hanging from her rear-view mirror and is listening to ""Ave Maria"" on her stereo. The hospital in the movie is treated as a for-profit corporate monstrosity, but there are Catholic statues everywhere. The sad fact is that Catholic institutions in this country are often too bureaucratic and money-centered. And many traditionally Catholic hospitals have merged themselves with secular institutions, etc. But none of these interpretations are offered by the movie. While the word ""Catholic"" is never used, it is obviously a Catholic hospital and depicted horribly.",John Q
214,janinequinlan,Ethics and John Q,8,11 February 2016,"Burg and Cassavetes' (John, Q, 2002) melodrama about a family whose structure, health and happiness is being torn apart by monetary, political and unethical medical practices, has created an interesting discussion of ethics, more so than cinematographic criticism, on its behalf. Interestingly enough fourteen years later, we are put to task to examine bioethical issues outlined in this film. John Q is a film about a man who takes the healthcare system in his own hands in a violent manner after he finds his son needs a new heart whilst his insurance coverage has been changed and does not cover the transplant. He holds a room full of (ED), Emergency Room patients hostage with an empty gun in an attempt to get his son's name on the transplant list declaring ""this hospital is under new management, Free Health Care for everyone"" (John Q. 2002).(Q) and his family had their self-respect and respect for persons violated. Self-respect entails consideration of the decisions of autonomous persons and the protection of persons who lack decision making capacity as does Q and his family (Phillips, 2000). Lack of health literacy and the inability of the hospital system to engage with the patient are primary problems. Self-respect obligations necessitate treating persons with respect and keeping promises (Phillips, 2000). Promises were violated by Q's employer when they did not inform Q of the insurance change. Rebecca Payne, the hospital administrator, lied when in collusion, in an attempt to ambush Q in the ED. Therefore, Q's initial and continued action may be the result of indignation and ignorance, and rightly so. Says Q to his son before he is about to euthanize himself ""Always keep your promises"" (John Q, 2002).Q technically was acting unethically for he inhibited the autonomy of the other patients in the ED, even though the end justified the means by getting his son on the transplant list and a new heart. Additionally, Q was put to task by his wife's words to do something. I am not really sure why the onus was only on him do that something, though.The guiding, bioethical principle of beneficence was broken by Q when he put other persons in harm's way and instilled fear of death by gunshot, though he had an unloaded gun. The gun could, and did, force hostages to act in a manner that was harmful to one another to trump evil. Actually, the alternate evil character was a physical abuser to his girlfriend and a sociopath who received penance though he seemed to change his ways at the end, trumping evil. Though Q was acting in an evil manner by restricting person's liberty, he succeeded in catching and removing the sniper to remove evil and harm. Furthermore, Q promoted good by offering his own heart for transplant in the end. Informed consent for Q's own surgery is in question. It is not in intact for his son's surgery. He did not consult his wife. Though she would agree to a transplant for her son, she likely would not agree to the transfer of Q's heart to her son. She was not autonomous in decision making for her son. For Q, informed consent was true in disclosure, comprehension, consent and voluntariness, but not in competence. A person needs should not be under duress so they can be competent (Faden & Beauchamp, 1986). Additionally, Q tried to force the cardiologist to do Q's surgery and bear witness to suicide, a form of negligence, disallowing James Woods to do what he thought was necessary in his medical opinion (Faden & Beauchamp, 1986). Q's act of hostage taking was evil but the motive and objective was good in action, saving his son from death (JBC, 2008).The decision of the hospital administration to discharge Q's son due to financial constraint, reeks of injustice and to Michael's parents it is an act of hospice without saying so. The hospital is not doing due diligence through education and discharge planning. So the answer is Q acted morally, but unethically and in the manner of a caring and vigilante father. Q had options which he did not understand due to lack of health literacy. As stated earlier due to the pre-emptive discharge of Q's son in such an irresponsible manner, leaves an opening for Q to argue for a longer stay. Other options one could have taken would be to contact civil liberty organizations, advocate lawyers, the American Heart Association, the ethics committee of the hospital, the State Board of Medicine in Illinois, the AMA, the state insurance board, pediatric medical associations, Shriners, and any relevant benevolent society. I did not see a social worker involved either or a case manager.If Q was in California and on the Kaiser Permanente plan, his family would be in serious trouble. This health care systems are run by the insurance companies with doctors working for the insurance companies. My sister-in law, Mary Lombard died of late untreated multiple myeloma because Kaiser Permanente doctors ignored her pain and refused to do x-rays. Instead they sent her to chiropractors (Lombard, 2013). Within 6 months of her diagnosis, Mary at 45 years old was put to rest by her 83-year-old mother. That is hypocrisy.",John Q

The second half of the movie is too heartbreaking and the strong message is weakened. I don't know who to blame for it, it seems that the director made a mistake by turning the movie to a personal heroic sage, instead to keep the social message, which is extremely important, specially for American citizens that lives this reality, not only in health insurance issues, than also in eduction, culture and other issues.

The film is brilliant and not a single person exiting the theatre did not enjoy it. Everyone was so into the movie and was raving about it afterwards. I think the critics know that Denzel did a good job in Training Day, and another great job in John Q. and they just don't want to give too much credit for two movies in a row that's all it is! Denzel always makes good movies, and if the critics can't face that then that's there problem. The movie is so moving and made me want to cry at some points and also made me happy at other points. It had a great cast of all good actors, and I really admire Kimberly Elise's performance in the film she is becoming one of my favorite actresses and I think she is one the most underrated actors because she is just outstanding! I also love Robert Duvall,Eddie Griffin, and James Woods, and even Anne Heche did a great job as the cold-hearted hospital administrator.

His performance in 'Training Day' was good, his performance in 'The Hurricane' was brilliant, but his performance in 'John Q' tops them all. Words can't describe how good he was.

I'm not sure if it did/could have effect on actual policy, but I'm sure it touched many hearts everywhere.This movie could have been 10/10 but for poor script-writing at very crucial points. The level of drama was simply fantastic when Denzel/his wife were on camera, but otherwise suffered (most of the time), especially with the police scenes.In addition, I agree with some of the other reviewers that the ending was too 'hollywoody'.

Glad I cleared that up! First off John Q has a plot worthy of being made into a film, (a couple can't afford for their son to have a heart transplant so the father takes the hospital hostage). Not a problem there. But c'mon people...how many cliches do you want to cram into a film?Let's start with the characters. We've seen them all before: the cold hearted doctor, the arrogant and obnoxious commissioner, the hyper-full-of-myself T.V. reporter...the list goes on. But what's worse is that there is not a single ounce of substance to them.The scenes outside the hospital are also hilarious. Okay, okay fair enough we want to support the father on his mission but it is poorly executed.
What is a serious issue soon becomes a bore, not because of a lack of twists but the absolute reverse. There are just too many and they are very far-fetched yet simple at the same time! (Confused? I am!!) There is no originality, no depth and the film feels like it is an extremely tacky, simple, plain, rushed job with no attention to detail. Denzel Washington does his best to try and carry the film but quite frankly his filmography has seen much, much better days.Making a film about saving someone's life should not mean wasting the viewer's life!

The act of taking unlawful control of a situation with the use of hostages in order to have certain individual demands met is terrorism. Is the left so radical these days that this sort of behavior is acceptable? Is an individuals feelings on national healthcare reason enough to take hostages? This film teaches us that if we don't agree with something then we should take hostages and make demands. Of course to hide the real truth of the man's actions the lead is black, which of course makes him 'oppressed' and he is saving his young child which is 'honorable.' This joke of a film falls into the same ultra liberal category as ""The Life of David Gale"" another film that supports unacceptable radical actions. This type of film is counter productive for the liberal movement. There is other ways to communicate and solve problems, terrorism is not an option, and if it is, then it is not an option I would honor. Besides my political opinion the film is illogical, horribly acted, cliché ridden, and trite.",John Q

When checking up John finds that his insurance does not cover his sons operation. He doesn't have a high paying job so he can not afford the operation and he cant raise enough money in the time given. He decides he needs to do something. He grabs his gun and he holds everyone hostage in the emergency room while barring off the doors and turning off the power to the elevator. He tells the women in charge of the hospital his son needs a heart and she will get him one or he will start killing people in the room. This goes on for awhile. You witness a car crash and learn that the women who died in the car crash had the perfect heart for John's son. His son will eventually get that heart.Infrequent language.Only Gore is when John is shot,his sons operation,and a mans hand in the waiting room is very bloody.As the movie is based on the premise of a man holding up an emergency room in a desperate attempt to save his son, the movie is intense and has intense thematic elements.Would not recommend for younger viewers.",John Q

I feel like people that are giving this movie a bad review is just over analyzing every little detail. Denzel Washington is as fantastic as ever and makes this movie as emotional as it is. I think this movie is pretty accurate to how American health systems work, yet there are still flaws to how it was portrayed in the movie--THIS IS TYPICAL!! If it were completely accurate, I'm pretty sure everyone would be drooling from napping because the movie would be so boring. This has the perfect amount of drama, excitement, comedy, and everything in between! I think people just need to sit down and relax while watching this movie, because if you're going to pick at every detail you are not going to have a good time watching it. I would love to own this movie, but I see it on TV about once a year and each time I get so excited to watch it. It's so heartfelt and moving and I think anyone would enjoy this movie!",John Q
227,iroquois_pliskin00,"Very unrealistic, but okay.",5,27 July 2019,"I hadn't watched this in over a decade, but thought I'd check it out again today. I remember liking at the time, but finding some parts very laughable. I did not take it serious, but watched it as kind of a dark comedy toward the end. I am for the first time noticing just how bad it is, as far as egregious continuity errors and shaky plot. There are the inconsistent characters, the terrible ending and the glaring inaccuracies throughout the entire film. I can't go into everything, because I'd be here all day. I'll just say that some of the most ridiculous things I noticed were:-None of the hostages attempted to seriously escape once John was incapacitated.
-His wife could run to the door of basically a crime scene, with hundreds of police around, and nobody stopped her.
-The surgeon said ""disbarred"" which refers to a legal profession I thought, not a medical one.
-The terrible 'swerve' where we are supposed to believe that the cops thought Eddie Griffin was Denzel/John Q. Come on, man.
-The fact that after the hostages were released, Robert Duvall's character let John sit and watch his son's surgery. I'm assuming this would've taken hours to complete. He's just standing there the whole time waiting to arrest this man?
-It's a tense situation where John is threatening to kill people, and the crowd is laughing when he comes out holding a gun at the sniper's head?Again, there were a lot of messed up, inconsistent plot points in this one, but Denzel overall is good in his performance. I suppose he did what he could with this role, but I can't give the film anything higher than a 5 for ruining the immersion with all the silly errors and dumb things. I couldn't suspend disbelief when these things occurred. It took me out of the movie tbh.",John Q
228,billfrmstl,Ludicrous One-sided Worship of a Terrorist,3,22 February 2002,"I love Denzel and have seen most of his movies but this flick ranks as a one-note exercise on our current state of healthcare in the USA.I can't believe that the studios were worried about releasing COLLATERAL DAMAGE with its terrorist plot but hadn't the slightest concern about JOHN Q whose main character is a terrorist portrayed in a sympathetic light.  The main character locks himself inside an Emergency Room in a hospital with the usual slice-of-life one-dimensional characters and then proceeds to threaten a surgeon with a gun to add his son's name to a heart donor recipient list.
What leads up to the hostage plot is nothing short of a simplistic one-sided view of the US healthcare/insurance system in the United States. Nowhere in the Constitution does the Federal Government guarantee everyone the right to free healthcare. 15 years ago, HMO's were seen as a white knight to save people money on healthcare. The old system which required most people to pay 20 percent of the cost and their insurance picking up the rest worked fine but people fell in love with their $10.00 co-pay to see a doctor and HMO's became the standard. People failed to realize that HMOs significantly cut down on major medical procedures to cut costs.John Q, played by Denzel, is a father whose every setback on his quest for a new heart for his son, is met with a sound effect that sounds like a dump truck being dropped from the roof of a tall building.  The heavy handed direction and manipulative script really try a movie-goers patience. Yes, we feel sorry that his son is sick but the fact is that, in light of September 11th, the main character who we are supposed to feel empathy for, is nothing more than a terrorist.James Woods does a great job of lampooning an uncaring heart surgeon, Anne Heche is a cartoon character big bad hospital administrator, Ray Liotta is a publicity seeking police chief and some guy with hair portrays a stereo typical news reporter.The exceptions to this cast are Robert Duvall who is a tough but caring hostage negoiator and John Q's wife whose name I didn't see. Also, the comedian named Eddie got off some funny one-liners.The plot is riddled with ludicrous holes from the heartless bureaucracy to the women going into labor. Early on in the hostage scenes, I wanted to throw my popcorn at the screen when the hostages could have easily overpowered John Q and when the police officers being ridiculed by the crowd and cheering the terrorist instead.",John Q

Although it often seems he's playing himself, he's fortunate that he's a sufficiently interesting human being with enough dimension that even when he does that, he's fascinating.This movie has much to recommend it. Although the build-up to the blow-up takes a bit longer than seemed necessary, once the crisis point is reached, the pace is brilliantly done. The predicament in which he finds himself is all too believable in an era of corporate greed run rampant, and his rage is clearly and cleanly focused. The emotional roller-coaster that follows his rash decision to hold the hospital hostage is powerful and compelling.The emotional scenes as the movie nears its denouement are achingly good. When he makes the ultimate decision, then fails to execute it on the first try, any viewer not on the edge of his or her seat is probably already dead.About the only criticisms I have of  this movie are the implausibility of one man holding a hospital hostage as he does and the acting of Kimberley Elise as John Q's wife. The supporting cast as a whole is above average and Robert Duvall is just short of brilliant in what could have been a pretty mediocre role.A definitely good flick that will make you think a *little* but mostly just provide intriguing action as a diversion.",John Q
234,ronnieronb,I don't understand how anyone can like the premise for this film or why kidnapping and holding hostages could ever be seen as acceptable.,1,24 March 2006,"I can understand why someone would ever hold an entire emergency room hostage, but I could never condone or accept it. This movie shows a completely amoral solution to a very difficult situation. I absolutely believe that there could have been another solution.If people think that I don't have a lot of sympathy for Denzel's character, then I agree. I don't. I'll tell you why. My friend and I were kidnapped at gunpoint when we pulled into the parking lot of a popular bar. Three assailants pulled guns on us and forced us back into the back seat of my friend's car. Two of the kidnappers bound our hands and put tape over our eyes. The kidnappers then drove us to a house. They took our wallets and demanded our PINs to our ATM and Credit Cards. We were beaten for more than 30 minutes while at least one robber went to withdraw money from our accounts. The robbers were threatening to kill us if they did not get any money, but I had already made the maximum withdrawal from my bank account. I guess I was SOL. I might have died for only 400 dollars. My friend has a wife and 3 kids. I have my own family. In my own opinion, I wasn't really hurt. But does it make it okay that my friend and I were kidnapped? Think about it, what if you were kidnapped? Or your mother, father, son, daughter, sister or brother? This film is extremely irresponsible. I can't stand films that try to put a positive spin on kidnapping. The Negotiator with Samuel L. Jackson is another one of these films. A rapist is rapist, a murderer is a murderer and a kidnapper is a kidnapper, no matter what. Here are some people that were kidnapped and or held hostage: Daniel Pearl, the Lindburgh baby, Polly Klass, the people on the tragic flights of 9/11. What did the kidnappers want in these other situations? You should already know what happened to these people. Were the kidnappers justified in what they did? Are you ready to applaud theses kidnappers, and pat them on the back? Give them a high five or a big hug and a kiss on the cheek? Some of the kidnappers got what they wanted. Anyone that thinks that John Q. is justified in what he does is clearly mislead and deluded or in need of some mental evaluation.Watch The Clearing, The Pledge, or The Vanishing(Spoorloos 1988) and you will understand what a despicable crime that kidnapping is. Anyone that applauds John Q's actions DOES NOT COMPREHEND HOW UTTERLY EVIL KIDNAPPING AND HOSTAGE TAKING IS. I do understand that John Q is only a movie and is entertainment, but I don't care. I don't like it. The only reason I gave this movie a 1 is because ZERO is not a choice. It is a shame that Denzel did this movie, because I truly enjoy his other movies. It is a shame that someone who was in Training Day, Glory, and A Soldier's Story was in this horrid piece of garbage.",John Q

As he goes against all odds to save his dying child we are kept right on the edge of our seats wondering, what will he do next? I found myself gasping with the rest of the crowd as Jon makes his next move, snearing at the police for trying to stop him and crying, ""no"" when he steps into a snipers crosshairs.Although Denzel did a fine job in Training Day, I wasn't sure if this was his year to be nominated. It didn't seem right to me, but now I see how talented Denzel really is.

I also was not impressed with the rather heavy-handed political message delivered at the end. Yes, we need to provide health care for the poor, but to show Hillary Clinton and lament the fact that we turned down her atrocious health care plan is too much. That weakens the end of the film and weakens what could have been a pure an emotional story. The movie flirts with making its characters one-dimensional, but avoids that at the end.

250,drewclark,Entertaining despite its flaws...,7,18 January 2003,"I was caught up in this movie from the very beginning, and it didn't let go.  I can't say I was disappointed in the least, despite a few problems.One of this movies faults is the long list of stereotypical characters: Robert Duvall as the over-the-hill cop who knows how to do his job so well he ends up going head-to-head with the stereotypical politics-are-everything police chief played by Ray Liotta, for example.  Many of the minor characters suffer from the stereotype bug, as well--but the kicker is, while I was watching the film, the only one that really stood out was the plastic news reporter.  The guy was way overdone--typed to death, as it were.  It took me several hours to realize that so many other cookie-cutter characters were involved in the story, because the story gripped me that tightly.There are plot holes, but most of them are easily explained away, if you want to take the time.  What matters most about this film are its good points: 1) Denzel Washington is brilliant.  Purely brilliant.  He consistently makes me believe that his character exists, and John Q. is no exception.2) The ""Everyman-left-in-a-lurch-by-a-system-that-doesn't-care"" situation is terribly formulaic, but it's also a formula that WORKS.  Even if Denzel Washington wasn't superb, it would be easy to sympathize with his character just because he's getting screwed and choking to death on red tape. 3)  The way tension is built is incredibly well done--there are some moments when you're wondering not what's going to happen (formula is formula, after all) but how the story is going to get past the current obstacle and get us to where we know it's going.  The SWAT sniper sequence is one such example of the director knowing his craft and knowing just how much to give us--it's drawn out, but not for too long, before the situation breaks and we get our relief. I can't say John Q. is flawless.  It has moments that seem a bit contrived, and at times might leave some viewers wondering ""how did that happen"" (one example, which I've seen pointed out here, is the hostages' ""turning"".  To some it seemed sudden and unexplained, but the scenes where the hostages were watching the situation on live TV explained it all to me).What I can say about ""John Q."" is this:  if you want to see Denzel Washington doing what he does best, and if you've ever felt that the system gave you a raw deal, this picture is worth a look.",John Q

How many patient and law-abiding parents did John Q leap-frog in order to get immediate care for HIS offspring? (Talk about the 'selfish gene'!) Of course, writer James Kearns makes it all work out for the best -- to the point that the hospital actually seems to run better when it's being lorded over by a hothead with a gun. But then Kearns had improbably staffed the hospital with a fiendish administrator who was a cross between Eva Braun and Anne Robinson of the Weakest Link -- for which the script writer, incidentally, owes an apology to the vast majority of hospital administrators who (agitprop notwithstanding) actually have a heart -- and are forced to work within restraints that are for the overall benefit of everybody and shouldn't be subject to veto by any angry parent with a firearm.I could tolerate this film if John Q had shown any repentance at all, ever -- but far from it, he rides off into the sunset (to an incredibly short stint in the pokey) with a self-satisfied smirk on his face -- apparently totally uninterested in the fate of the sniper whom he gratuitously sucker punched so hard as to likely cause internal bleeding that could easily lead to death in real life -- possibly depriving that sniper's son of a father. But then John Q has made it clear all along that he's not interested in ""sons"" in the abstract: he just cares about his own son, thank you very much.If I could have rewritten the movie, I would have ended it with the grown Mike (now enrolled in college) chastising his father as follows:Mike: ""Dad, I'm grateful for you saving my life, but..."" Dad: ""But what, son?"" Mike: ""Well, it's just that I've been reading Immanuel Kant in philosophy class and...."" Dad: ""You've been reading WHAT?"" Mike: ""And I fail to see how your actions square with the Categorical Imperative."" Dad: ""Look, you got a new heart, son: be happy.""

However, I hope that the message is not that the action John Q. takes is justified.  Think about it.  Is the message that sometimes terrorism is ok? Is it ok to take hostages and threaten people with death if you can't get things your way?  Are abortion clinic bombers then justified for their deadly deeds?  I see the character, John Q, as another bin Laden and thus, an enemy of civilization. Terrorists in my world are part of the problem not a viable option to solve problems.

The audience I was in was genuinely enthralled here, even if the predictable were to follow. Unfortunetly, the movie rushes so many other points. All the ""tension"" that's builds up in John in the beginning of the movie as he tries to secure surgery for his son is not dealt properly with, and the sentencing at court scene at the end has as much tension as flipping a coin in determining a sentence. Granted, to lengthen the film in the bookends would make this unbearably long. I felt it should of ended after the collage of media clips, ala Traffic.Also, there is a part in the film where John's best friend gives a moving and intelligent speech about the Health care industry. Problem is, the speech isn't becoming of his character. Not that he should be some stereotypical blue-collar worker, but he suddenly develops: 1. great speaking skills and 2. a much deeper understanding of Health Care Industry then I thought he reasonably had.Duvall here is adequate, which is very disappointing. Maybe the remnants of ""Falling Down"" are controlling my opinion.The worst part of the movie, with out a doubt though, is the music. Melodrama music to begin with is just bad, but this stuff is truly terrible. I'm going to investigate who's responsible for that, and see if I've ever heard any of their work before, just to see if it was just an isolated incident. I mean, you don't notice the music that often when you see a movie for the first time, unless it's extraordinary in some way. Unfortunately, it's extraordinarily bad here.I also thought the name Frank Grimmes (Duvall) was especially funny, being it of a one-show character from the Simpsons (the guy who worked his way from nothing, only to meet his down fall in Homer's path of idoicy towards bliss).  If you want to see a classic hostage movie, see ""Dog Day Afternoon"".6 out 10",John Q
261,fhwines,Cliches spoil the plot and the acting,5,8 August 2020,"I'm seeing a lot of ecstatic reviews for this movie, I found that surprising. Yes, Denzel and his actress wife do an excellent acting job. Yes, the idea for the movie is unique, provocative and definitely needs to be addressed as one of our society's worst failing.
But the movie deserved a more believeable set of characters. Anne Heche appears not only heartless when she offers to ""make this a happy time"" but almost takes joy in it. This behavior seems exaggerated for the purpose of making the audience understand that the insurance world doesn't care if we die a slow death. Besides, she sheds a tear at the end, so why this cold front? And doesn't anyone think that, during that fateful meeting when the parents learn their son will die if he doesn't get a heart transplant stat, absolutely no hospital official present would have offered the sobbing parents a tissue? C'mon. That didn't look real.
Other weird situations: why do we not see Denzel when he finds out they found a donor? In one scene, he's about to shoot himself and in the next he's watching the surgery. Why is that scene missing from the movie?
Speaking of missing scenes, wouldn't you want to see the sentencing part? We do hear I can get 3 to 5, possibly only 2 years but you're kind of hoping for a judge's intervention or something. Nope. That's the end of the movie.
Dialogues are full of cliches, too. Who wrote this?
And just Anne Heche's character is artificially cold, the reporter is artificially sleazy and good-looking, the crowd is artificially cheerful (looks like a football game), the young doctor is artificially nasty (before he gets maced and pummelled by his artificially ditzy girlfriend). Anyway... you get the drift. Good movie but not that good.",John Q
262,paulcosta,Beautiful movie that makes you think..,7,7 February 2002,"This movie was a beautiful picture about a man who is fighting for his sick son.  His son has a heart larger then normal and no one realized this until he went into cardiac arrest.  John Q, played by the wonderful Denzel Washington, finds out, to his disbelief, that his insurance wont cover the operation to replace his sons heart, which means he must pay 30% of the fee upfront.  He tries to raise the money only to find out they are releasing his son.  This is where the Thriller part of the movie comes into play. After hearing this he takes the hospitals ER hostage and threatens to kill everyone unless his sons name is added to the heart donars list immediately. To make a long story short this movie is DEFINATELY worth the $10 USD to see it..",John Q
263,anyone_else,good film... we liked it,8,16 January 2007,"The following text is supposed to be a response to the comment of ""Troy (Troy2Slick)"" Dear Troy, we dislike your comment because you tell us what we have to think about the film. We don't want to know if we need to watch a film or not! We just wan't to read someone 's opinion without being affected in any way. Now to our brief comment: We think that ""John Q"" is favoured by the female sex because it's more about emotion and love. There is not enough action for most of the boys or men. But there is not none of it. The director of the film has chosen really good actors. Especially the performer of John Qincy Archibald perfectly plays his part. Best thing was that the film criticized the American health care system and we'd like to know whether politicians have opened their eyes and tried to change something because that would be great!Please write a pm to us if you know about it:)Martin & Michèle",John Q
264,hauntedseb,A question of time...,8,14 January 2007,"There was a musician called Charles Schuldiner. In December 2001 he died, suffering from a brain stern cancer. His story is comparable to John's son Mike. Because he didn't have any insurance company behind him, he was sentenced to pay all the medical stuff and surgeries by himself. There was only one surgery missing, perhaps a few medicals, too, as his money went out. That's how it works in the United States of America. Most people aren't able to pay the insurance and it might be a question of time when they would reach the point where the government divorces poor from rich people. I think ""John Q."" is a movie that's told to open people's eyes. Untypical for him, Denzel Washington plays the role of a father who only has the competition to make his family survive, to give them a home, something to eat and everything a family needs. As his son Mike gets a heart attack during a baseball match, the whole family seems to break down. Full of desperation, because Mike needs a new heart immediately, John tries to bring up the money to get him on a donor list, in a legal way. But nothing seems to work as he believed. Desiring that his ""champ"" would survive, he conquers a hospital and takes the workers - and some patients - as hostages. Unexpected, the whole city is on his side, everyone wishes him the best for his plan and, surely, for his boy. He even is ready to give up his own life to make Mike survive. A few seconds before he pulls the trigger of his gun, after ordering the doctor to put his heart into Mike, his wife hurries in, bringing the news that they found a heart for the boy. In the end John gets imprisoned for taking the hostages in the emergency room. In a fictional way ""John Q."" tells the stories of thousands and thousands of people, living or dying in the USA. These are the ones who might be worthless for all the great great people in the country. Their worth is addicted to the money they own and if they didn't have any, they are dead. Maybe today, maybe tomorrow or years later. But they are DEAD. Living corpses who are waiting for the illness they won't be able to pay. Where is the dream of the endless possibilities? It's hidden under a government of capitalism and war. It's buried under the earth of a state, where gas is cheaper than water, the only ""modern"" state although celebrating the death penalty. Perhaps America's leaders should think about their priorities. At least ""John Q."" gives a hint to them. I wish that every politician of the US recognizes the movie as an emergency call. It's your people, your nation and everyone of them has the right to take part of it.",John Q
265,goerlichtristan,"John Q, Drama how it should be",8,14 January 2007,"First of all I have to congratulate Denzel Washington in the role of John Archibald, his role as a desperate father fighting for his sons life is outstanding. The other actors also did a great job, creating an authentic atmosphere. I especially like the simplicity of the sets, when you come to think about it most of the movie plays in the waiting room of the hospital. Even more than that I was amazed of the complex characters and the way they develop as the story goes on and the way they interact with each other. So in the conversations not only the issue of an unfair health care system is discussed, but also racism, the ethical views of doctors in situations that are everything else than ethical as well as the propagandistic influence of the media on public opinion. I mean when John Q enters the hospital and is taking randomly hostages to force a new heart for his son through he is clearly a criminal, but as the reporters hit the scene, they shape the public view on this desperate gunman. So in the end he leaves the crime scene as a hero. Of course you may argue about the moral integrity of this certainly extreme measure. Can a single man take personal liberties away from innocent civilians to save a child's life? That is a question everyone has to answer for himself. I also don't want to discuss the main theme of the movie. I think the information given by the story is impulse enough to make up your own mind about the health care issue regarding poor citizens in the United States of America. The politics are one side of this movie. But more interesting, in my opinion, are the single hostages in the waiting room and how they develop relationships, to each other and to their hostage-taker. The way these individuals grow in this rather exceptional situation is remarking, a huge accomplishment of the actors and their astounding performance. So at last I can say that I would really recommend this movie to people who like good drama with convincing acting. You are going to have a few good laughs, a lot of sad moments(goose bumps guaranteed) and last but not least a critical view on the American health care system. Even though, I recommend you not to give too much thought to the discussion expressed in the film while watching it and save it up till after viewing it. That will give you the advantage of keeping the focus on the story and developments that take place at the moment.So enjoy the flick and I hope this review was helpful to you.",John Q
266,Trogenvoodoo,Having a lovely family is better than a family with problems!!!!!,8,15 January 2007,What I think about this movie is quiet good?Why? Well the problem in this family is their son is dying so they are trying to save him but that wouldn't be possible without money. So John did everything to save his son but the problem is that the money is everything which even goes beyond the basic humanities morale and that is very bad. So its better to have a family with a ill son who was later on cured and the father going to be freed from jail soon than to have a family with problems. And I think that this movie can teach us many things about morale so I recommends this movie to watched by all age to put a better morale in to the families society nowadays.,John Q
267,efj1973-1,"Another solid film for Denzel, Nick Cassavetes, cast and crew.",8,28 February 2002,"I'm a huge fan of Denzel's and the film was inspirational but the script was a little to preachy at times but entertaining nonetheless.  I felt like the script had potential as we watched Denzel Washington (John Q Archibald) and Kimberly Elise (Denise Archibald) family life unfold and watching Denzel interact with young actor, Daniel Smith (Mike Archibald )  was wonderful, but once John takes hostage of the hospital emergency room the film becomes sketchy.  I love the climatic drama but the infusion of preaching about how HMOs treat patients started to become a public announcement instead of the great film it started out as.  I love Denzel no doubt and Kimberly Elise (I'm so glad they finally let her shine) but I was disappointed in the script's ending it could have been a lot better.",John Q
268,idletime2000,Incredible!!!,10,30 May 2002,"This is probably the best movie I have seen, ever. Period! It is a blow of atomic proportions to the American health care system and to the insurance industry. As a legal alien from a country where nobody asks for payment before surgery, this is almost unbelievable. But, after having had the ""pleasure"" of meeting the health care industry as a patient, I do understand this move all too well. I am lucky, I have the most excellent coverage available, so it didn't cost me much. Every American should see this movie and act. Is this really how you want the society to be? Health care is dependent upon your wallet?See the movie, cry and then start to act. Let John Q be your hero!",John Q

Not quite likely.The ending was way too predictable. Of course the movie begins with the white woman dying in a car accident so we all see it coming. But still it was too predictable.Only one cop taking a shot at John in the air vent? And he messes up and get really easily subdued by John? Ow come on! And the cop only had one bullet in his weapon? So he sees John coming towards him and he does absolutely nothing with the gun in his hands? Yeah right. And when John was punching him he did absolutely nothing to put up a fight.But besides the holes in the movie and the cheesy ending I still loved the movie. 7 stars out of 10.",John Q

Thats just what is preceived from the commercial and the scene from the commercial where Denzel announces free health care for that day at the hospital to the people is just disturbing. its a good movie if your the type of person who likes to feel sorry for yourself and blame everybody for your problems.The film makers put a face to this type of personality and his name is Denzel. Its hard to take in a movie with such selfish values in its main character. its like the writers are so high on themselves and their own self preservation its scary, This Film just stinks of selfish morals, and tries to make a hero out of a felon.

271,dcj54321,"WOW! Unheard-of, but highly recommended",9,30 June 2007,"Denzel Washington, who has won 2 Academy Awards and has been nominated an additional three times, gives an incredible performance in this memorable movie. Practically unheard-of to most people, John Q is not just an average movie in that it succeeds its goal of drawing emotions. A comedy intends to bring out happiness. A horror intends to bring out fear, and a drama intends to bring out suspense and often sadness. John Q is able to bring out every emotion it intended. Viewers will be on the edge of their seat, waiting to see what happens next with an unlikely hero and the most important moments of his life. Viewers will love this movie.Although the story line seems somewhat disreputable (making the bad guy out to be a hero), you can't help but side with John Q and cheer him on because you realize what he stands for. He stands for justice and equality, he stands for life and honor, and he stands for mankind. The message of the movie is simple. Everyone deserves life.I hope that anyone who can agree with the above statement watches this movie. You will not regret it.",John Q
272,srotha,A solid movie but not Oscar material,6,8 February 2002,"Last night I attended an advance screening of ""John Q"", the new movie starring Denzel Washington. The movie, directed by Nick Cassavetes, is about a blue collar worker whose son needs a heart transplant, and whose insurance will not pay for it.Washington gives a solid performance as the boy's father, John Q. Fitzgerald.  The movie is about how an ordinary citizen deals with extraordinary circumstances.  Washington went to great lengths to prepare for this role.  He spent three months with factory workers learning their job, even though only a few brief scenes take place at his place of work. The preparation shows, as he manages to ""stay in character"" and capture the mind-set of the American factory worker.  Anne Heche (Ms. Payne), the hospital administrator. Ray Liotta (the Chief of Police) and Robert Duvall (Police negotiator) give capable performances in supporting roles.The movie highlights the plight of Americans in need of reliable insurance. Nearly 50 million Americans have no health insurance coverage at all. Also, several million ""working poor"" have inadequate coverage.  7000 Americans died last year while waiting for organ transplants.  Hopefully, the movie will bring increased public attention to these issues.",John Q
273,tljones,The movie is definitely worth seeing at the Cinema.,10,15 February 2002,"""John Q."" was an exceptional movie. I have read exactly two comments from this site that states that this movie does not deserve an Oscar. I just would like to say that I completely disagree. This movie deserves as many Oscars as there is possible to be given. One of the reasons given was because it was stated that John Q's actions were not a solution to his problem, however, if one looks at the movie carefully, one would see that he tried several options, and did everything that was told of him to do. He tried. Yes this movie is emotional, is'nt that what all movies try to do? Get the viewers drawn into the mind of the writer? This movie mastered that skill...and that's why it deserves an Oscar, because the writer and the actors accomplished, exceptionally well the art of helping the viewer to feel what the characters feel. To open the door of intellegence, where the TRUTH must be accepted. John Q's actions ""may"" not have been the solution, but when one thinks about it, was it a solution in ""American Beauty"" for character of Kevin Spacey to behave the way he did in front of young teenagers just because he was having marriage problems,or for his wife to do what she did? Does it mean that that movie doesn't deserve a Oscar? Did ""American Beauty"" not absorb the audience? Or was it a solution for the character of Tom Cruiz in ""Rain Man"" to do what he did in order to get what he wanted...were any of these solutions? Did not ""Rain Man"" deserve an Oscar? Tell me, do you really, and honestly think that ""John Q"" does not ""deserve"" an Oscar. Denzel is a wonderful actor. If he wasn't do you think he could possibly charge as much, or be payed as much money as he has for just one movie? Do you think he could possibly bring in as large a crowd to the Cinemas, no matter what the movie is if he wasn't? Denzel deserves this Oscar, no question about it.",John Q

The movie is on very unstable ground because the story of John Q overcoming the hospital and insurance system to save his son is rather unconvincing. Directed by Nick Cassavettes, it would seem that this is a individual's attempt to influence public opinion, a bad one at that.
Casting Denzel Washington, James Woods, Robert Duvall, Ray Liotta, Eddie Griffin isn't going to strengthen a movie without foundation. Eddie Griffin doesnt have any role to play in the movie and is totally wasted. Denzel Washington, Robert Duvall and James Woods turn in good performances but not good enough to turn the movie around.The movie is full of flaws. In fact, every movie has flaws and people do notice the flaws. But a good movie contains moments, scenes which take you away from the flaws and make you the see the beauty. This movie had no beauty, consequentially, the flaws were obvious.The movie states that over 7000 people die of diseases requiring major surgery for which they dont money and that over 45 million Americans are under insured. The movie also brings in footage of Hillary Clinton, Bill Maher pushing for better health care measures. The movie's attempt to convince you that if these needs are not taken care of every man will become a hero by taking a gun and holding people hostage in order to save his kith and kin is meek.Somewhere close the end John Q gets asked what he's waiting for, `I'm waiting on a miracle, waiting on an act of God.'

However, I believe that John Q's efforts are completely futile as an overall solution to the greater societal health-care problem. He caused many people to suffer needlessly because of his unfortunate disposition. Any rational person would agree that it is not legal to force any person (e.g. Medical Specialist) to work without compensation. This is known as involuntary servitude and it is unconstitutional. I'm sure John Q wants to get a paycheck when he does his job. Medical Specialists command respect and are deserved of a competitive salary which reflects their relative skill. One may question whether or not they are overpaid for their work? Well I guess that depends on how much we value our lives. Can we make the same argument for professional athletes? No we can not. At best we can say that they are skilled, and they make a disproportionately large salary. John Q is completely misguided. Why? The HMO system is a move toward socialized medicine, because they base their fee schedules on the Medicare fee schedules. This means that the HMO's pay the medical specialists no more than the Medicare fee schedule will pay as compensation. Thus, HMO's are in lock step with a universal health-care system, and as John Q found out the hard way, the system sucks.",John Q

If only Congress would address this problem by creating a National Health Insurance Program or requiring HMO's to pay for all medically necessary care, people wouldnt end up in John's situation.I don't blame John for what he did.

If you are a Denzel fan and feel like watching a well performed and touching film... then get a box of tissues and sit down and watch 'John Q'.

About a year ago my brother told me to watch this movie, since then I've probably watched it over 100 times. I watch it at least once a week and whenever someone comes into my house, they don't leave without watching this movie. This is without a doubt the best movie I have ever seen, and probably will ever see. If you don't see this movie you are really missing out on an hour and 52 minutes of pure excellence. It is such a heart-warming and meaningful movie that anyone can enjoy. I strongly recommend this movie.",John Q
294,jackierose413,"Once the glitter wears off, reality begins to set in",5,13 June 2009,"I liked this movie the first few times I saw it. It initially blew me away, the level that a man has to stoop to in order to save his dying son. It has highs, it has lows, it has medical drama straight out of the play book of E.R. But the more I watch it, the more it grates on my nerves. The clichés and outlandish plot just unfolds like a broken accordion. Kimberly Elise's crying scenes force me to skip forward because her shrieks are like nails on a chalkboard. The more and more I watch and dissect the movie for its take on the plight of the underinsured in America (of course, the guy just happens to be working-class black), the more I realize that the movie is riddled with inaccuracies.Blah, blah, blah. A little black kid from a working-class burb needs a new heart and dad will do anything in the world to get it for him. To think that the story ends there, even though the director does, is foolhardy thinking. What about the anti-rejection drugs the kid will have to take forever? Who will cover those costs? What about the environment he will have to live in and the limitations he will have on life? What about the thousands the kid will have in medical bills afterwards? What will dad sell then? What about if the kid rejects the heart? The movie would lose its feel-good quality if we looked at that harsh reality, but it's irresponsible not to. Let's demonize the health care industry instead. Of course! John Q is entertainment with a bit of social examination thrown in for good measure. But I hope that when one watches the movie they do not think that government will solve all with national health care. I do hope that people won't think that anyone can be saved just by calling the local news or staging a stand-off in a hospital. Take it for face value: it's a first step in a complicated argument.",John Q
295,hawk66,Very good movie. Says alot about the health industry,7,22 February 2003,"Watching this movie you have to think what would you do in the same situation. You can't blame the John Q for what he does, right or wrong. Only a parent can understand that you will do anything to save your child. I know I would. Like they say a parent should never have to bury their child. It was a very good movie that brought out alot of different feelings in a person watching it.  It sad to see how our health system works and how the movie reflects that in our society alot of times its all about money. Would recommend this movie but for some people have alot of tissue.",John Q
296,petrov180176,One of the best movies I have ever seen!,10,11 July 2003,I would recommend this movie to everybody. It makes you a better person. Denzel Washington really deserved his Oscar. Yahoo movie rating really sucks. The critics gave it only C-. F*** the critics!,John Q
297,jl_cook,Great,10,16 April 2011,"This is a true example of death panels that have been and are already in place determining who gets health care and who doesn't. Other than that you can relate and feel the pain of the father all to well. From the first of the movie it flows nicely and you can attribute that to the great directing. and the skill of Denzel. The moment that captured me was the score during the period of him trying to gather money which I think is Stevie Wonder. Another part would be the when he first takes the hostage, fumbling with the gun, showing genuine ""fight or flight"" responses and acting just how I would react to that high stress situation. This movie takes you some where most fathers would not hesitate to go. Considering that we have had recent debates on ""death panels"" helps the mood even more. This should be viewed by most who oppose health care. The movie is very convincing and relate able.",John Q
298,pickre01,"The movie ""John Q"" theme is about one man fight against the heath care system in our country.",8,1 May 2011,"The movie ""John Q"" theme is about one man fight against the heath care system in our country. Danzel Washington played John Q Archibald where he is a factory worker. John Q is trying to support his family after his hours has been cut. Trying to keep food on the table and a roof over their head is hard enough. John Q and wife Denise played by Kimberly Elise were at a baseball game watching his son Michael played by Daniel E Smith and all of sudden their son collapse on the baseball field. They takes their son to the hospital to find out that their son has a heart condition and needs a heart transplant. At that same time John Q finds out that his health insurance policy won't cover the transplant. So John Q goes to his place of employment to talk to them about his health care insurance policy. He finds out that they have changed their health insurance carriers and went from a PPO to a HMO health insurance. Since they have cut his hours, his insurance that they are on will only cover $20,000.00 and he need $250,000.00 for the transplant. In this scene the angles are over the shoulder shoots. He tries to find away to pay for his son's heart transplant with no luck. He made several calls and talked to several services but he couldn't get any help. His family and friends try to raise the money to cover the transplant, but it wasn't enough. After giving the hospital all the money that he has raised he gets a phone call from his wife Denise that they are going to release their son from the hospital. Then it shows the extremes that John Q will go through to save his son's life, starting off with kidnapping Dr. Raymond Turner played by James Wood. The music that is played during this scene is very intense and the shot that are used are close ups. John Q takes the Doctor into emergency room where he ends up keeping several people in there against their will. After John Q takes over the emergency room he comes in contact with Lt. Frank Grimes played by Robert Duvall. Lt. Frank Grimes tries to talk John Q into releasing the hostages and turning himself in. He even tries to talk John Q's wife Denise into talking him into releasing hostages. In the end he was ready to kill himself so the Doctor could transplant his heart into his son. Right before he could shoot himself he found out that there was a heart for his son. The transplant worked and the hospital ended up paying for everything. John Q had to go to prison for kidnapping but his son received a new heart and to him that was worth it. The movie shows that there needs to be changes made to the current health care system in our country.",John Q
299,coolsurfer7,"A great movie, and a powerful one",9,29 October 2003,"John Q is a great movie that has many strong dramatic performances, led by Denzel Washington. Though this is not the only powerful movie he has made, this indeed is one of his best. The movie begins with a scare, as John's (Washington's) son needs a hard transplant, and his insurance doesn't cover it. Although he tries to save enough money to pay for the transplant, the cost is too much. So John decides to take matters into his own hands by shutting down a part of the hospital and holding the people there at gunpoint, demanding his son have the transplant. A bit of a stupid move, but as the movie progresses, we see it wasn't such a bad move at all. Overall this movie gets an 8, a solid film for Denzel.",John Q
300,dombasas,Denzel saves the movie,6,20 November 2003,"If not Washington's brilliant performance, the movie would be really awful. The story is banal and really nothing special, but you can't stay stony-faced, when you see Denzel playing his role with so many emotions. Just imagine someone else in Denzel's place - then the movie would be real crap. To sum up, watch John Q only to see Denzel's brilliant performance and nothing else.",John Q
301,deadlycookie,Shows the downside of the American Health System,5,13 June 2004,"I liked this film, at least from when the action started. It is a typical film structure where there is a build up to certain events and then a dramatic ending. It shows the downside of the American Health System compared to say the health system in Great Britain. It's a very emotional film for people who get emotional about films, and gets you thinking about what you would do in John Q's situation.Well worth if you like Denzel Washington as his acting is excellent. Kimberly Elise also has some hard scenes to act and does very well. I wasn't too impressed with Ray Liotta in this, as his acting seemed...wooden, but he didn't feature in it a great deal.If you watch this on DVD don't forget to check out the special features, mostly just for the documentary on the health system, as it confirms many of the things featured in the film.",John Q
302,paulmclaughlin703,horrible movie,1,11 April 2004,"This movie was a horrible unrealistic comment on healthcare in the united states.  The public jumps to support a madman who holds up an emergency room, risking the lives of others by not letting patients who urgently need care get treatment.  even the more minor characters in this movie are horrible, not because actors such as james woods lost cant act, but because of horrible writing. the 'evil' people in the hospital cant deciede if they want to let the young boy have a heart or not, each changing their mind several times, and because their characters are not developed at all they seem to do it for absolutely no reason.this movie sucked, despite all the good actors in it.",John Q

304,thepsudo,An incredibly powerful movie!,9,29 May 2005,"This is a spectacular thriller about the problems with the US health care system, a father's extreme measures to protect his son, the troubles and strains of a blue-collar worker, and the manipulation by the police and the press of a high pressure situation. The title, ""John Q"", refers both to Denzel Washington's character John Quincy Archibald and to the typical reference to the everyman, John Q. Public.Denzel Washington gives a truly edge-of-your-seat performance as the father out of options, and the rest of the cast -- while sometimes given less realistic characters to play -- still play their parts very well. As usual, though, Denzel overshadows them all.While I don't agree with the nationalized health care system this movie promotes (dollar for dollar, private charities can accomplish the same thing more efficiently than the bureaucratic government), this move is a spectacular thrill-ride and worth any price of admission or purchase.",John Q
305,amelia1160,"""John Q' Starring- Denzel Washington",9,4 April 2005,"I saw this move last night on the CBS Sunday Night Movie. At first, I thought that this was a movie with a very serious subject matter, which it is. But after the scene where Ann Heche tells the Archibalds that their son will have to leave the hospital, I was sure that this movie was a satire. I am a registered nurse, and I know how things work in a hospital. No one at any hospital would be so cold, nor could they kick a sick patient out legally. That's when I first decided this was a satire. Then I noticed all the really talented actors in this truly crazy movie, such as Washington, Duavall, and Woods. I figured they were all socially conscious people who did this move as a satire, with the purpose of exposing all the heartless, insane, unfair, cruel things about our health care system. This movie was so crazy, I was sitting there laughing at what I was SURE was a satire. But when it was over, I looked in the TV guide, and it was listed as a ""drama."" Sure, it was a drama, but also a satire, right? Just LOOK at all the crazy behavior! What about the ditsy blonde kicking that guy in the ER lobby? Wasn't that supposed to be funny? Wasn't the whole movie supposed to be funny? Just the idea of a parent hijacking a hospital to force doctors to perform a heart transplant on their child indicated this is a satire on our insane health care system.",John Q
306,msfinet,From The Movie JohnQ,9,1 May 2005,"I had a sense of understanding just what it must be like being a father, along with trying to be the best father you know how to be! Watching JohnQ Brought back many memories of family values on love that I was brought up with.I learned a lot about the differences between HMOs and PPOs.I truly was very moved by JohnQ. Denzell Washington did a most wonderful acting job in the role as JohnQ.Watching him play the role of a father who was willing to go the the limit if need be for the love of his son,moved me to tears. I always enjoy watching Denzell,he is and will be one of our great actors of all time.MsFinet",John Q
307,kymmmurphy,"Good, but a little over the top",7,7 August 2021,"Great premise, message. But the ridiculous show if crowds in a nice and neat semi circle all cheering like they're at a baseball game, around the ER entrance is over the top fantasy. Also the number of police staged outside with their little pistols drawn is so unrealistic. This movie could have really made a statement about the corruption of the uncompassionate health insurance and hospital system, but it missed the mark. In any case, great cast and Denzel is amazing as always.",John Q
308,carotweiner,Propaganda piece with a C grade script and an A grade actor,4,11 July 2017,"The most accurate part of this crudely cobbled together propaganda piece, is that Jay Leno is indeed, not funny. John Q is a movie so absurd in its premise and so biased in its presentation that not even Denzel Washington's amazing performance could salvage it. It revels in it's own vaingloriously self-appointed righteousness, expecting you to come along with it. And no matter your views on the healthcare debate, the film insults its audience at every turn, and turns very real issues and a very real discussion into propaganda worthy of the Stalinist Pravda.John Q (Public) Archibald, has his status as an every man drilled into almost every scene of the movie. The only time we aren't being reminded of how much of a blue-collar, truck driving, baseball loving, Christian American he is; is when we busily being told how rich, monstrous and stupid everyone in power is. The doctors wear the kind of designer fashion suits, with pocket squares, that you never actually see them wearing around the hospital in real life, because why would anyone do that? The administrators work in offices filled with ostentatious art, giant sleek desks, and even have an antique medieval shield on display; the exact same way that no hospital has ever actually done, because again, what actual person would do that? Comic book villains spout derivative lines to highlight their villainy, but when John Q threatens to murder people, he is lauded. His hostages applaud his threats on their lives. The hostages don't act like hostages, the nurses don't act like nurses, doctors, cops... on and on, the movie has a very shallow portrayal of how human beings actually behave. That isn't a problem for some movies. Films like Kill Bill will live in an obviously fictional presentation of the world, and it works because the film acknowledges that status and uses it. But the writer, the director, the men and women who made John Q are either obliviously out of touch or more likely, highly aware of the propaganda they are constructing. If you ever start to think for yourself, the movie will helpfully remind you of what side you are supposed to be on, the crowd in the movie cheers and boos for you like a studio audience.The true shame of John Q is that it hides some really excellent scenes between John Q and his son. Driven home by the acting chops of Denzel Washington, who manages to squeeze in incredible nuance and the hurt of a father afraid for his sons life, a man desperate and at the end of his rope. But these alone are not enough to salvage the movie as a whole.My parting words would be these. Enjoy the movie for what it is, not for what it thinks it is. Even as plot hole laden, and unrealistic as John Q is, it's a story about a desperate father... that unfortunately has a political ad jammed into it.",John Q

It's really a touching movie, it moves you. There's action,drama and everything I want in a movie...and it's stressful!!! I think they made a good choice in the cast. Denzel Washington is excellent in the movie. This movie holds you by a thread urging to break any second but in the end all ends well. It's really a movie worth to see many times. I love it.

310,al-carroll-88,EXcellent,9,23 November 2005,i my opinion this is one of Denzel Washington's best performances. when his child's develops a fatal heart condition he rushed to hospital only to find that his insurance policy doesn't cover the illness. this is due to the policy being changed by his company. the film is about John q and his wife trying desperately to raise the cash needed to pay for the heart transplant. when John Q finally admits defeat he resorts to taking the hospital staff hostage and forcing them to operate on his son. the film is very moving and will have you thinking about the injustice of the American health system for weeks afterwards. i think that every Washinton fan should see this film as it is the best film i have seen him star in.,John Q

And those hospitals that prioritizes those who had their insurances, that even if you're already dying in front of them no care would be given to you if u cannot assure them that you're ABLE to pay... so ghasty talaga!

I have a sick child with a tumor and the Medical Insurance doesn't cover so I do know how it feels to be in a situation where there is no way out. It is amazing what a desperate father can do when they feel pushed and with no feasible way out. This movie is compelling, sad, loving, gripping and realistic.
