0,SnoopyStyle,Inappropriately Brilliant,8,22 December 2013,"Willie (Billy Bob Thornton) is a drunk who plays store Santa for Christmas. He and his partner-in-crime Marcus (Tony Cox) case out the department store where they work and rob it on Christmas Eve every year. Willie befriends a chubby loner boy (Brett Kelly), and bartender Sue (Lauren Graham) who has Santa issues. Then store manager Gin (Bernie Mac) muscles in on their action.Bad Santa is demented and destructive. Billy Bob Thornton goes over the edge, and Tony Cox goes right along with him. This is no Christmas special. And I love the kid Brett Kelly. He isn't your average adorable little kid. He's your average loser kid. That makes their friendship so much better. This is a great black Christmas.",Bad Santa
1,Prismark10,Christmas jeers,6,5 December 2013,"This is a cynical and rather amoral film about a man who has had enough of life. He drinks and drinks, swears, pees in his pants and somehow still pull the ladies.He is also an expert safecracker. Billy Bob Thornton plays Santa Claus at various shopping malls every Christmas. However this is a prelude to rob the malls and spend the rest of the time getting drunk in Miami before next Christmas arrives. He is assisted by a a midget who plays the elf.As Santa's go, he is mean, foul mouthed and nasty. He is bad Santa.As a comedy it does not really work unless you like seeing an adult being mean to kids although John Ritter and Bernie Mac do provide the laughs.It is more of a black comedy-drama of one man on the edge who finds some sort of humanity when he encounters a kid and see's some genuine kindness.The picture wrong-footed me as I expected a big lapse into sentimentality at the end of the film but Billy Bob Thornton's Santa has a heart smaller than the Grinch.Although there is some light at the end as Bad Santa does thaw it is not a mushy ending. There are others in this film who more nastier and cynical than Bad Santa.",Bad Santa
2,claudio_carvalho,A Gem of Black Humor,7,27 December 2005,"The drunkard Willie (Billy Bob Thornton) and his partner, the midget Marcus (Tony Cox), work once a year, near Christmas, dressed like Santa Claus and his helper elf in department stores. However, their intent is to rob the place in the Christmas Eve. When Willie meets a lonely fat boy (Brett Kelly) and the hot bartender Sue (Lauren Graham), he learns the meaning of Christmas and gets in trouble.""Bad Santa"" is a gem of black humor, and certainly one of the most ""politically incorrect"" movies I have ever seen. Imagine a drunkard outrageous Santa Claus cursing children, having ""unconventional"" sex with fat ladies, stealing safes in department stores in the Christmas Eve, lying to everybody, beating children and pissing on the clothes and chair of Santa Claus. Billy Bob Thornton does all of these bad things (and more) while working dressed as Santa Claus along a couple of days before Christmas. Further, all the characters of this movie are corrupt somehow or stupid. The hilarious happy ending is not so happy and I really liked this movie a lot. This movie is dedicated to John Ritter, who plays the manager of a department store, in his last work on the screen. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Papai Noel às Avessas"" (""Santa Claus Backwards"")",Bad Santa
3,classicsoncall,"""Go get the next lucky boy or girl, OK?""",7,23 December 2011,"By all reasonable standards of human decency, there's no way that I should have found anything to like about this picture. It's rude, it's crude and it's lewd, but at the same time there's a quality to Billy Bob Thornton's character that rises above loser once he's found his unique purpose in life. Trouble is, that purpose comes in the form of beating the snot out of a punk who treated his new young friend badly. Along with that redemptive quality, Thornton has the unique ability of taking the foulest language and raising it to the level of art form. Pound for pound, there are probably more uses of the F word in this picture than just about any other one I've ever seen. Before viewing, be sure the kids are tucked away safely in bed or otherwise under lock and key before popping this one into the DVD player. You wouldn't want them to be scarred for life by someone like Santa Claus.",Bad Santa
4,gavin6942,Actually Less Racy Than I Was Hoping For,6,16 July 2006,"Previously, I had only seen about ten minutes of this film when flipping through channels and catching it on Comedy Central, heavily edited. This was around March or April, so certainly out of season. Appropriately, I watched the film in its entirety in July.I had expected the film to contain intense vulgarity, but was actually almost let down by the lack thereof. Yes, there are many F-bombs and S-bombs, but they aren't provocative in this modern world of casual cursing. Luckily the midget's creative insults picked up the slack, and Bernie Mac was a pleasantly welcome addition to the cast. Even John Ritter, who I traditionally despise, was quite amusing.This is the story of a serial burglar who uses the guise of Santa Claus as his cover to gain entry to mall safes around Christmas. This film picks up where he is now battling severe alcoholism and a complete lack of Christmas spirit.Billy Bob Thornton was an excellent choice for the main role. I have read Bill Murray was supposed to do the part, and I think he would have been great... but Billy Bob really captures the essence of drunk, sleazy and useless human being. Rumor has it he was often drunk on the set, and I do not doubt this for a minute.I found ""the kid"" to be overly annoying and could have used less of him. His role as a plot device is not convincing. I am also unconvinced that a gorgeous bartender (Lauren Graham) would be attracted to a bum like Billy Bob, but I guess it happens in real life, too. And I freely admit I am personally biased... seeing the mother from the ""Gilmore Girls"" in a very sexual role was quite a shocker and not very welcome (thanks for destroying my innocence).I also disliked the end greatly.But despite my laundry list of complaints, the film is overall quite funny and it is amusing to see Billy Bob in a roll that really brings out his best traits. I would much rather watch this again than anything cheeky like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" or even other contemporary Christmas films like ""Surviving Christmas"" with my beloved Ben Affleck. Best Christmas film of all time? Well, that would be ""Home Alone"" (possibly)... but this gives it a solid run for the money.",Bad Santa
5,jboothmillard,Bad Santa,5,14 December 2008,"I watched this film once before, and probably basing my opinion on the original rating by critics, two out of five stars, I found the film a bit mixed, but I'm glad I watched it again and changed my mind, directed by Terry Zwigoff (Crumb). Basically, Willie Soke (Golden Globe nominated Billy Bob Thornton) and his dwarf assistant Marcus Skidmore (Tony Cox) are professional thieves. Every year, Willie gets a job as a department store Santa Claus and Marcus as an elf to rob shopping malls at night, with Marcus' wife Lois (Friends' Lauren Tom) as their getaway driver. Marcus takes the job seriously, but depressed Willie, a sex-addicted alcoholic, becomes incompetent performing with children, his safe-cracking abilities and affected, much to Marcus's dismay. They are hired at the Saguaro Square Mall in Phoenix, but prudish mall manager Bob Chipeska (John Ritter) is shocked by Willie's vulgarity, he brings him and Marcus to the attention of security chief Gin Slagel (Bernie Mac). At the mall, Willie is visited by Thurman ""The Kid"" Merman (Brett Kelly), a kind but hugely gullible, dim-witted overweight young boy who thinks Willie is the real Santa Claus and is constantly bullied by a gang of skateboarding teenagers. At a bar, Willie meets Sue (Lauren Graham), a woman with a Santa Claus fetish, and they begin a sexual relationship. After some casual sex with Sue, Willie is harassed and attacked by a Hindustani hoodlum (Ajay Naidu) from the bar, but Thurman helps him. Willie gives Thurman a ride home, where he lives with his senile grandmother (Cloris Leachman). Thurman reveals that his mother died and his father, Roger, is ""exploring mountains"", when he is actually in jail for embezzlement. Willie tricks Thurman into letting him rob the house safe and steal his father's BMW 740iL. After further complaints from Bob, Gin starts to investigate Willie. When Willie sees his motel room being raided, he moves in with Thurman, to the kid's delight. Marcus is angry at Willie for taking advantage of Thurman, disapproves of Willie's sex addiction and him making rude remarks about Thurman's grandmother. Gin visits Thurman's father Roger (Ethan Phillips), indirectly revealing that Willie is illegally staying with Thurman. Gin confronts Willie and Marcus at the mall and takes them to a bar. He reveals he has figured out their plan, and blackmails them for half the score to keep silent. Willie and Marcus' partnership is falling apart, as Willie continually shows up drunk, and to the shock of Marcus and Gin destroys the Santa attraction. Willie attempts suicide by inhaling vehicle exhaust fumes. He gives Thurman a letter to give to the police, confessing all his sins and the planned Christmas Eve heist. Willie notices Thurman has a black eye, he abandons his suicide attempt to confront the skateboarders, assaulting and intimidating them to leave Thurman alone. Furious at Gin's blackmail, Marcus and Lois set a trap for him. They trick him into thinking they need help with their car, Lois hits Gin with the car, and Marcus electrocutes him to death. Willie and Thurman prepare for the approaching holiday with help from Sue. On Christmas Eve, Willie, Marcus, and Lois hit the mall for the burglary. Willie takes a pink stuffed elephant that Thurman said he wanted for Christmas. Marcus pulls a gun on Willie, intending to kill him, frustrated with his increasing carelessness. Just as Marcus is about to shoot Willie, the police show up, tipped off by the letter Willie gave Thurman. While Marcus and the police fire at each other, Willie flees. Determined to give Thurman his present, he leads the police to chase him to Thurman's house. Ignoring their orders to freeze, Willie is shot repeatedly in the back on Thurman's porch. Willie survives and writes to Thurman that he is recovering in hospital. He expresses his gratitude to Thurman, and reveals that he was cleared of the robbery, being shot when unarmed embarrassed the police. Sue becomes a guardian to Thurman and lives with him until his father's release. Marcus and Lois are in prison. Willie ends the letter by telling Thurman that he should be out of the hospital soon and to be ready for his return. Thurman stands up to a skateboarder bully who confronts him, he kicks him hard in the crotch and rides away on his bike giving the finger to the downed bully. Also starring Family Guy's Alex Borstein as Milwaukee Mom with Photo and Octavia Spencer as Opal. Thornton is terrific as the grouchy, foul-mouther safe-cracker who doesn't hold back dressed as Father Christmas, Cox is good as his equally foul-mouthed ""elf"" partner-in-crime, and Kelly is relatively cute as the lonely overweight boy who forms an unconventional friendship with the swearing Santa. If you are a real Scrooge when it comes to Christmas, then this is a good alternative to the conventional sentimental and good-natured festive film, full of constant profanity, some dark material, and good deadpan humour, definitely not one for the kids lol, a fun seasonal black comedy. Worth watching!",Bad Santa
6,Tweekums,Crude but hilarious Christmas entertainment,8,21 December 2019,"Willie, a grumpy drunk, and Marcus, a dwarf, work together as Santa and his Christmas elf in shopping malls. This is not for the love of the Christmas season but because they plan to rob the mall when the safe is full of Christmas takings. Each year they change names and cities. This year they are in Phoenix. Willie is drinking more than ever, swearing in front of the children and having sex in the changing rooms... Marcus thinks all of this is unprofessional as it nearly gets them fired before they can rob the mall. The manager asks the head of security to investigate. While on duty Willie is visited by a child named Thurman who seems to actually think he is Santa... which proves handy when Willie needs a place to stay! Before the day of the robbery Willie gets together with Sue, an attractive barmaid with a Santa fetish and helps Thurman deal with some bullies.If you are after a Christmas movie for all of the family this is most definitely not it! Our protagonist is not only a criminal but also a total degenerate whose behaviour is almost always inappropriate. If you are not easily offended there are laughs to be had from start to finish. Most of these come from Billy Bob Thornton's eponymous 'Bad Santa'; he does a fantastic job making the character sleazy but without making him unlikeable. Tony Cox is solid as Marcus; Brett Kelly is great as Thurman, a character I initially feared would be annoying, and Lauren Graham was likeable as Sue. The story moves at a good pace with none of the scenes being dragged on too long. There are one or two surprises before the end but nothing that felt unlikely. Overall I'd definitely recommend this as an antidote to all those saccharine Christmas moves.",Bad Santa
7,BA_Harrison,"Bah, humbug!",2,9 November 2016,"I know it's still only early November as I type this, but the ads on TV are already gearing up for Christmas, so what the heck a big dose of seasonal humour in dubious taste is just what I need to help get me through the imminent long dark winter. Unfortunately, Bad Santa is not the film to fill me with cheer: despite critics claiming it to be uproariously funny, the film delivers about as many laughs as a double bill of Leaving Las Vegas and Requiem For A Dream.Billy Bob Thornton plays low-life drunken conman Willie, who teams up with 'little person' Marcus (Tony Cox) to pose as Santa and his elf to rob department stores on Christmas Eve. When Willie meets a troubled kid at his grotto, it looks a though this might be a turning point for the booze-addled screw-up, but no he continues along his self-destructive path, being thoroughly obnoxious and foul-mouthed for the entire movie. Thornton's grouchy, abusive, misogynistic, self-destructive Santa is the be all and end all of the entire film—a one-note joke that isn't funny in the first place.",Bad Santa
8,moonspinner55,Not too 'Bad'...it overcomes its own gross exaggeration with solid characterizations,7,5 January 2005,"Judging from the advertisements, I figured the plot of ""Bad Santa"" would consist mainly of Billy Bob Thornton being a crass, drunken department store Santa Claus--but the writers concocted an involving plot, and Thornton actually creates a character. OK, so he's a mean, nasty drunk, but he's at the mall for a reason (although I don't believe his reckless behavior would've kept him hired for long; the filmmakers overlook this rather obvious fault for the sake of shock laughs). This being said, the other characters in the film are quite a colorful bunch, especially Lauren Graham as a husky-voiced bartender and a young child actor named Brett Kelly who completely embodies the down-trodden spirit of a dysfunctional, disillusioned Christmas--this kid causes Thornton to stop in his tracks for a minute and think about things. The film doesn't go all soft and gooey when Kelly arrives, and I'm glad for that, but it's blessedly not a one-joke affair. *** from ****",Bad Santa
9,dbdumonteil,Father Christmas is a piece of trash,8,31 May 2007,"Willie (Billy Bob Thornton) got a raw deal. He's a badly shaved, alcoholic human wreck. Every year, he re-enlists for a job as a Father Christmas in a mall he hates and burglarizes the place with the help of his tiny accomplish Marcus. But the landing of a waitress and especially a little boy who thinks he is the real Santa Claus will positively change his life although the progress will be slow.I remember when I went to see Etienne Chatiliez's latest offering, the underwhelming ""la Confiance Règne"" (2004) in the theaters, the trailer was announced and I figured: ""it must be a vulgar comedy. I won't go and watch it"". I decided to give it a go a few days ago and I was pleasantly surprised. I haven't watched Terry Zwigoff's ""Ghost World"" (2001) but I was deeply amused with this trash comedy that John Waters would certainly have taken pleasure in directing it. If elegant films with refined cues are your bag, you'd rather not watch ""Bad Santa"" which will probably make you want to take to your heels. It's a delightfully politically incorrect film that damages the comforting image of famous Santa Claus and which doesn't shrink back before bad taste. Zwigoff shot a festival of filthy (and sometimes witty) cues and enormous gags. I dig his first meeting with the waitress when he reveals to her: ""all I can do is eat, drink and have sex"", ""prove it"" she replies. I let you guess the next shot. However there's nothing gratuitous in this schoolboy perspective. The endless tests Willy went through in his lifetime made him heartless and installed him in a couldn't care less behavior. Remember the opening sequence when he exposes his woes. Because he thinks he has no place in a clean, smooth society, Willie rejects it and it's the opportunity for Zwigoff to dynamite this cozy world. But the pathetic, pitiful portrait Zwigoff makes of his hero doesn't exclude some tenderness and sympathy for him. There appears a quality from the director: amid a sea of crude dialogs, he manages to convey a good dose of emotion for this obnoxious character.One can skip the few weaknesses like some stereotyped characters and a few easy moments (Willie has his lunchtime break, a mother and her little girl walk near him."" Oh! Look darling. It's Santa Claus!"" Predictable reaction from Willie: ""can I have my lunch time break?"" and hail Billy Bob Thornton who excels in a difficult role. Save it for Xmas and consider it as the polar opposite of Xmas movies brimming with joyful feelings.",Bad Santa
10,Quinoa1984,It took two viewings to really get into it- and really laugh my head off,9,18 January 2004,"The first time I saw Terry Zwigoff's latest effort (co-executive produced by the Coen brothers) Bad Santa, I didn't know whether I was watching a comedy that had astonishingly funny and madcap moments, or if it was a really bad movie. At times the script felt like it was under the penmanship of demented cretins off loan of some low-rent porno company. But there were scenes and moments with good old Billy Bob Thornton that had me laughing uncontrollably, so I decided to see it again recently. Now I understand it- this is a dig-in nails, ribald, hardcore satirical look at one (un-kept is a term used loosely) man in the midst of Americana during Christmas time. This man is Willie, played by Billy Bob, as something of a loser, low-self esteem, boozing, cursing, and a thief, though only at Christmas time. In a sense he's a modern day pirate without a shave, though with a yearly plan to rob a large store in a given mall he's given a job at with his co-patriot Marcus (Tony Cox, whom you may recall from uproarious bit parts in Friday and Me, Myself, and Irene). In one season, however, he meets a Kid (Brent Kelly), who for some reason looks up to this con-man in a red suit, giving him a place to stay in turn (never asked for) for some advice and help with bullies and self-esteem. On the first viewing of Bad Santa, along with not knowing whether I was seeing a good or bad film, I didn't know whether Billy Bob was pushing the 'rotten-dude' envelope over the top or just right. This may be a problem for most viewers going to see it once and not thinking of seeing it again. But I think Bad Santa is one of those movies that merits a repeat viewing- you may laugh less or harder at certain jokes and moments of outrageousness, some may fly over your head completely or make you go ""eww"". Yet I think the brilliant aspect about Bad Santa is it never takes itself a bit too seriously. Even in the denouement, when we are sort of assured things will turn out alright; it's like a denouement on a South Park episode. In fact, that's something that can be said about Bad Santa, is that it feels like a work in the vein of Parker and Stone, but since it's from the director of Ghost World it comes off a little fresher, with an appeal all its own.",Bad Santa
11,michaelRokeefe,Are you really Santa?,7,13 December 2003,"Absolutely dark. Side splitting funny in a twisted way. Two criminals join up for the holidays and disguise themselves as Santa(Billy Bob Thornton) and his elf(Tony Cox), traveling across the country to major malls and robbing the stores blind. This year the foul mouthed Santa takes advantage of the passive hospitality of an introverted 8-year old boy(Brett Kelly)who believes he is giving shelter to the real Santa. The boy's father is on a hunting adventure(in prison)so the chubby lad stays with his grandmother(Cloris Leachman) who is in a constant medicated stupor. The mall director(John Ritter) has many complaints on the drunken Santa, but trusts his head of security(Bernie Mac)can keep dirty Santa on the up and up and hopefully from insulting too many parents of the kids that come to convey their wish list. Knee slapping hilarious situations with strong language and sexual content. This is a strong ""R"" movie and small children should really not be in the audience. If so, their idea of jolly old Saint Nick will never be the same. Also in the cast are Lauren Graham and Lauren Tom. Billy Bob is super and I could watch this for many more Christmas seasons.",Bad Santa
12,jotix100,Dear Santa...,7,5 January 2004,"Terry Swigoff has come out with the perfect take off on the commercial side of Christmas with this tale of a raunchy Santa impersonator who is such a loser, but with his heart in the right place.Billy Bob Thornton's dialogue with the kid, an angelic Brett Kelly, is the stuff to make a parent cringe in absolute horror. We have always seen the figure of Santa as the perfect man, but never in our wildest dreams have we ever imagined anyone could be this way at all. That's why some people seeing this satire will get grossed out, while a lot of Swigoff's fans will be delighted by Willie, a down and out petty criminal who drinks too much, but always speaks his mind.Tony Cox as the elf is also very good, but this is Billy Bob's film from beginning to end. Mr. Thornton's work is always outstanding, as he has proven before, and he will continue to do so by choosing carefully the vehicles for his appearances. Brett Kelly is a little cherub. He is the perfect foil to Billy Bob Thornton, as he is the epitome of what a kid that age should be like.",Bad Santa
13,Hey_Sweden,This will become mandatory holiday viewing for this viewer.,9,1 December 2012,"""Bad Santa"" is the perfect antidote for those people tired of the usual run of feel good and family friendly holiday fare. It's got one hell of a funny and extremely profane script, and presents a man who just may be one of the worst Santas ever.He's Willie (Billy Bob Thornton), a miserable alcoholic with a bad case of self hatred who lets himself get dragged into one department store robbery after another by his conniving ""elf"" partner, Marcus (Tony Cox). Things finally take a different turn for Willie when he encounters Thurman (Brett Kelly), a portly, bullied young boy who lives a very isolated existence; he's got a dad in prison and a grandmother (an uncredited Cloris Leachman) who's not all there. The kids' sincerity and need for friendship set off something inside Willie, who after all this time has found something to live for.Thornton is wonderful in this role, one of the best of his career, and the other roles are equally as well cast. Cox is a hoot, as is Lauren Tom as the getaway driver, Lauren Graham as the sexy bartender who lusts after Santa Claus (!), and late talents Bernie Mac, as a security chief who learns the truth about Willie & Marcus, and John Ritter (to whom the film is dedicated) who's good as the uptight store manager. Director Terry Zwigoff (""Crumb"", ""Ghost World"") makes the most of the blackly comic screenplay by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa. It's a delight because it's so fresh and unpredictable in terms of what outrageousness the filmmakers will sling at us.Plus, there's just something irresistible about the time honoured premise of giving a pathetic character his much needed chance at redemption. (The film really isn't too far removed from ""A Christmas Carol"" in this regard.) As much as we laugh at Willie, we're too uncomfortably aware of how much his life stinks, and how well he knows it. As a result, Zwigoff maintains a really fine balancing act between the wilder moments and the more human ones.Provided the viewer is more than ready to handle all of the obscenities, and a story that gets dark at times, they should have a high old time with ""Bad Santa"".Nine out of 10.",Bad Santa
14,Bunuel1976,"BAD SANTA: THE UNRATED VERSION aka BADDER SANTA (Terry Zwigoff, 2003) **1/2",6,2 January 2007,"Disappointing (I've only watched Zwigoff's GHOST WORLD [2001] and am most interested in CRUMB [1994]): fitfully amusing but ugly and overly crude, even obnoxious. Once the film makes its point - that of foul-mouthed, alcoholic wastrel Billy Bob Thornton as the antithesis of a Santa Claus impersonator - it doesn't really do anything with it: the main development concerns his unlikely relationship with the obese and lonely boy and, while this section provides a good deal of chuckles (especially the painful boxing match), it's mostly condescending towards the latter...so that it's not much different from the rest (the bittersweet ending, then, doesn't really work)! Still, the constant sparring between Thornton and Tony Cox (as his colored dwarf sidekick and partner-in-crime) - basically resorting to the uninterrupted spouting of obscenities! - definitely makes for some lively (if, decidedly, repetitive) banter. From the supporting cast, Lauren Graham as Thornton's girlfriend comes off best (no pun intended); John Ritter (whose last completed film this proved to be) doesn't have a lot to do, while Bernie Mac is almost as unsavory a character as Thornton himself; Cloris Leachman contributes an uncredited and rather embarrassing minor role as the boy's senile grandmother. Surprisingly, the ""Director's Cut"" is the reportedly less explicit 88-minute version - rather than the 99-minute ""Unrated"" one (though even this didn't turn out to be quite as ""naughty"" as I had anticipated)!",Bad Santa
15,lastliberal,Billy Bob is a god!,8,7 December 2007,"No one, and I mean no one, could have played the title character better that Billy Bob Thornton. He was just fantastic and supported by a cast that was equally well picked.I never watched ""Gilmore Girls,"" so I was not familiar with Lauren Graham, who was spot on as Santa's girlfriend. I fell for her immediately, and keep an eye out for more.And Brett Kelly as The Kid. He was just too much. You couldn't help but like him.Of course, I wouldn't want to forget Tony Cox and Bernie Mac. Absolute, total enjoyment at every turn.Direction by Oscar-nominated Terry Zwigoff (Ghost World) and a script by the team of Glenn Ficarra & John Requa (Bad News Bears, Cats & Dogs) was a home run for laughter.This isn't a Christmas show for the little ones, but it sure will get the big folks in the spirit.",Bad Santa
16,zardoz-13,Holiday Hilarity Galore!!!,9,27 November 2016,"Sometimes genuinely obnoxious movies can prove entertaining. ""Ghost World"" director Terry Zwigoff doesn't pull any punches in his sarcastic, sacrilegious, but sizzling saga about a pair of thieves that dress up like Santa Claus and his Elf accomplice and rob a departmental store of everything at Christmas time. The first thing that is going to rile prospective spectators is the abundant profanity. According to the Kids-in-the-Mind website, the F-word or its derivative is uttered 130 times. This should slash a third of the audience for this interesting, artsy, crime thriller/ character study. Oscar winning actor Billy Bob Thornton is thoroughly persuasive as a down-on-his-luck individual who has dedicated himself to a life of debauchery and wound up masquerading as Santa Claus once a year as part of an elaborate crime. Willy (Billy Bob Thorton) is not the brains behind this skulduggery. Instead, Marcus Skidmore (Tony Cox) organizes everything. Marcus is as ruthless as he is short. He is a small person. Nevertheless, nobody should let Marcus' lack of height lull them into a false sense of security. He uses Willy to break into the safe so they can loot it for an eleven-month holiday until time comes for them to look for a new target. This time, they run into a challenging adversary, a Department Store Security Chief (Bernie Mac"") who is as smart as he is cunning. In one of his final theatrical appearances, John Ritter plays a sensitive story supervisor who discovers Willy having anal sex with a customer in a ladies' dressing room. The second reason you won't like ""Bad Santa"" is the amoral behavior of the hero. He drinks himself into a stupor and often winds up bedding down a single girl. His only dictum is that she must cry ""Santa"" during their sexual follies. ""Bad Santa"" is a crude, rude, lewd character study with a surprise ending for what is basically a matter-of-fact crime comedy.",Bad Santa
17,Boba_Fett1138,A Christmas movie that isn't a Christmas movie by the usual standards.,8,27 December 2008,"This is one rather special and certainly original Christmas movie. It still has the Christmas spirit and message in it but it delivers it in a never-seen-before package. Never has there been so much profanities and sex in a Christmas movie before and most likely there never will be again. It all works out well though for the movie and it makes its comedy and originality stand out.Billy Bob Thornton is a Santa Clause unlike any other. He swears in front of children, drinks a lot, enjoys anal sex with women and he basically doesn't care about anything. Besides, he's a thief and an expert at safe-cracking. All very convenient, when you as a Santa Clause in shopping mall have access to the safe, after closing time. But as you could expect this all slightly changes, once he meets a young, fat, not too bright kid, who starts to regard him as his second father. This sounds very sentimental and also very predictable for a Christmas movie but due to the movie its approach you can never accuse this movie of not being original. The sentimentality and messages of the movie all work out so well because of this.It's not a laughing-out-loud type of comedy but more of a subtle one, that is funny due to its very profanity and contrasts it shows with the usual Christmas movies. Quite a daring project but yet the movie never raised any objection and protest because of the simple reason that it's such a fine movie. Truly finally a Christmas movie that got aimed completely toward the adult audience.Of course part of the reason why the movie works out so well is Billy Bob Thornton's performance, for which he even received a Golden Globe nomination but lost to Bill Murray, for his role in ""Lost in Translation"". Ironicaly enough Bill Murray was first signed on for the lead role in this movie but later dropped out to do ""Lost in Translation"" instead. The movie also truly has one fine supporting cast with actors like Tony Cox, John Ritter and Bernie Mac involved. The acting feels really natural within this movie, which is really thanks to the approach of director Terry Zwigoff.It's a quite slowly told movie, that never pretends to be more than it is and doesn't feature any big sequences. Instead really little and subtle sequences, with some static camera-work and long shots, with often some nimble editing involved to capture even further the emptiness and also the subtle absurd-ism of the movie.It's like a Wes Anderson-Christmas movie, only done better and way funnier than something he has ever done in his career!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Bad Santa
18,view_and_review,Bad Santa was a bad movie,1,5 March 2007,"I'm no ultra-conservative, nor am I an artsy film type that sticks his nose up at anything that isn't perfectly written, directed, and acted out... but this movie was just trash. Not only was the comedy not funny, but it was just as vulgar as ever (or maybe that was supposed to be the appeal of the movie). And it wasn't vulgar in a clever way, but it was just straight up, undiluted, unadulterated crass humor. I attempted to watch this movie twice, just to see what so many people were raving about, and both times I had to cut it off. Although I'm not fond of foul language and sexual humor, I can stomach it in small doses, and even medium sized doses if it's done right. This movie, on the other hand, just took vulgarity and low life-ness (pardon my neologism) to the Nth degree. I gave the movie a shot, I tried to ride it out, but in the end it just wasn't my cup of tea.",Bad Santa
19,ferguson-6,"Bad Santa, Worse Movie",3,20 December 2003,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Being a Billy Bob fan and a Coen Brothers fan (producers of the film), I had high expectations for this one. Never have I been more disappointed or disgusted with a movie.  This makes the weakest Farrelly Brothers movie look like ""Citizen Kane"".  ""Gilmore Girls"" mom, Lauren Graham is reduced to the pathetic task of trying to maintain artistic integrity while asking Santa to deliver her the ultimate Christmas present.  This little joke is delivered not just once in the front seat of a car, but then again in a hot tub.  Billy Bob Thornton is actually very good in the movie and really captures the nasty sense the writers were after.  However, anyone with any sense of decency cannot overcome the awful jokes directed at the expense of the fat kid (no I am not one and never was) or the terribly uncomfortable position of John Ritter.  Bernie Mac has some moments, but please keep the kids away and if you have anything else to do... root canal, yard work, minor surgery ... stay away yourself.",Bad Santa
20,anaconda-40658,Bad Santa. Great Movie!,9,10 February 2016,"Bad Santa (2003): Dir: Terry Zwigoff / Cast: Billy Bob Thornton, Tony Cox, Brett Kelly, Lauren Graham, Bernie Mac: Unbelievably vulgar Christmas comedy about deceit or the wolf in sheep clothing. In this case it is the con artist dressed as Santa who appears with his trusty dwarf dressed as an elf to spread Christmas cheer before robbing the store. Billy Bob Thornton is hilarious as a bitter alcoholic who hates the holidays, which results in numerous amusing drunken outbursts in front of children. Tony Cox plays his midget partner fed up with Thornton's drunkenness, and practically runs an obstacle course just to defuse the alarms. Brett Kelly plays a naïve kid whom Thornton shacks up with when police search his hotel room. Kelly lives with his senile grandmother while his father serves time in prison for tax fraud. Bernie Mac steals scenes as a corrupt security officer. Lauren Graham plays a bar waitress who has a Santa fetish. John Ritter is featured in his final role as a squeamish mall manager. Superb setup that becomes a well written screenplay that may strike a note of truth to some. Director Terry Zwigoff who made Ghost World, takes a chance in a daring conclusion that works all the better because it doesn't play to the typical happy ending with a give and take. Not for families but it does stress the need to turn the bad into good. Score: 9 / 10",Bad Santa
21,The_Void,Bad Santa ain't bad!,9,2 January 2007,"Well, Christmas isn't exactly my favourite time of the year, so I have to say that these cynical offbeat Christmas films tend to appeal to me. When looking at the plot outline for this film, I was worried that it would start out well and then float off the rails when the central characters come to the inevitable 'moral junction', but to my surprise - Bad Santa is a film that manages to do everything you could want it to do. It's funny, it's crude, it's cynical and it actually has a message hidden somewhere behind Billy Bob Thornton's drunken central character. The plot focuses on a man who proclaims to have been married and 'on the inside', but prefers both to his current job - working as 'Santa' at various malls over Christmas. However, that's just a cover for his other job - which just happens to be robbing those malls! Along with his midget friend, the two work as Santa and elf for peanuts until Christmas Eve, when they use their knowledge of the shop to get at the safe with the money in it. However, this Christmas drunken Santa has accidentally befriended an annoying little kid and the security boss has discovered the scam...I'm a big fan of director Terry Zwigoff's previous effort, Ghost World, and Bad Santa works in a similar way with a bunch of oddball characters giving rise to an offbeat story. Billy Bob Thornton is obviously the centrepiece of the film, and he is excellent as the title character. He fits the role of a cynical conman Santa like a glove, and receives excellent support from the rest of the cast. Admittedly, the film can be a little one-note although when the inevitable shift in mindset comes, it's predictable, but actually doesn't upset the rhythm of the film. I wasn't expecting there to be any emotion involved, but actually the film does have some emotional weight, and even though the central kid is the most annoying I've ever seen in a film; he somehow becomes almost likable by the end. Of course, you have to account for a few nuisances - such as the fact that if I put on a Santa outfit and went to a bar, you could bet your bottom dollar that there wouldn't be a young woman obsessed with Santa working behind there. However, things like this don't matter as the film has more than enough to good points, and overall I have to rate Bad Santa as a big success!",Bad Santa
22,Sylviastel,This film is one of the dysfunctional family films!,9,26 December 2006,"Alright, Billy Bob Thornton as a crooked Santa Claus or Father Christmas as Kate Winslet would call him is a terrific safe cracker and alcoholic too. He takes a job as a Santa Claus with this dwarf actor who plays his elf. Anyway they go from Milwaukee to Phoenix for another score, there Billy's Willie befriends an unhappy overweight kid who thinks he is Santa Claus and saves him in the parking lot. They have an unusual friendship. The boy, Thurman Merman, lives with grandmother played by the multi-talented Cloris Leachman in this small, thankless role. The grandmother stays home and watches television and is oblivious to her grandson's new friend. His father is in jail for a white collar crime. Thurman lives in a nice Phoenix neighborhood and Willy is the only friend he has so far. I think the film needs a little work especially with Cloris' role. She was underused. Of course, this was John Ritter's last film role before his death in 2004. Still it's one of those dysfunctional Christmas movies that we are beginning to see more of now.",Bad Santa

Being myself a bit fed up by all the cheerful people when it's Christmas time this is the perfect antidote for me to make fun out of the Christmas spirit. Billy Bob Thornton as Willie the bad Santa puts down a terrific performance playing the rude and swearing drunk Santa. The Santa you hope your kids will never meet. Tony Cox as Marcus the elf is good as well in his role. But the one you have to feel compassion with is the kid Thurman Merman played by Brett Kelly. His is absolutely sublime in his role. You so feel sorry for him every time you see him. The plot is what it is, it's not great nor bad, it's just a comedy and you should just enjoy the actors. A must watch!",Bad Santa
24,Mr-Fusion,Crudely entertaining,7,22 December 2015,"If there's a subgenre of anti-Christmas movie -- and there should be -- then ""Bad Santa"" is leading the charge. The movie's so rude, you kinda wonder if the whole reason this thing was made was just to see Santa Claus behaving badly; Billy Bob Thornton happily pushes the limits of awful taste. And it's not just Thornton; John Ritter, Tony Cox, Bernie Mac and sugary sweet Lauren Graham all have memorable roles. They contribute to something so wickedly crude and bitterly opposed to the usual holiday treacle. It's a treat.One of the best scenes is Thornton administering a sinister beatdown to a douchebag teenager. That's what kind of movie this is. There's a tender heart beneath all the depravity, but most of the fun lies in the shameful.Very funny movie.7/10",Bad Santa
25,StevePulaski,Dark as a silent night,9,4 July 2011,"I can't exactly recommend Bad Santa to someone who is looking for a heartfelt Christmas movie. I can recommend it to someone looking for a piece of dark comedy art, or someone with a very weird sense of humor. Bad Santa is hilarious even in its darkest moments.Willie (Thornton) is an alcoholic mall Santa who spends the holiday season dressed as Santa having kid after kid sit on his lap telling him what they want. Willie's partner Marcus (Cox) plays a ""real-life"" elf, and after their season is done, they rob whatever mall they are in by breaking into the safe and stealing everything. Then it's on to another state/town.This season in Miami is especially different because now Santa has a kid who thinks the world of him. The kid's name is Thurman Merman (Kelly), and he isn't the cute and smiling kid you see in happy Christmas movies like Miracle on 34th Street. Thurman is an outcast, made the punchline of jokes by a group of kids because of his chunky stature. His persistency and obsession with Santa grows quickly as Willie stays at his house also occupied by Thurman's senile grandmother (Leachman).We also have Sue (Graham) who enjoys having sex with Willie dressed as Santa. The tough mall security chief Gin (Mac) has a sharp eye on Santa, and the mall manager is played by the late John Ritter who died only two months before this was released making this his last live action film role.The hilarity stems from Willie's offensive remarks. In one scene he is eating lunch, dressed as Santa of course, and a woman with her son walk up. The mother tells her son to tell Santa what he wants for Christmas when Willie angrily replies ""I'm on my f**king lunch break!"" Then when the mother threatens to tell management he says ""If you think you can make my life any worse, you go ahead and try."" My favorite scene is probably when Willie is too drunk to work and Gin and Marcus get in a fight when Gin tells Marcus to carry Willie out back. Marcus is angry because he thinks Gin has neglected to see he his only three feet tall, and they get into a scuffle in front of all the patrons in the mall.What makes Bad Santa work is how believable it is. We don't learn a whole lot about Willie's past other than lots of abuse led to his future problems with alcohol. But that is enough to believe Willie's hostility towards everyone, and not just think he has chosen to be miserable. Most recently, in Bad Teacher, that was the main problem. The main character had no good reason to be bad or upset other than the fact she probably just feels like it.What your laughing at isn't the cleanest most humor-orientated material, but in a dark comedy, sometimes even the dirties of jokes make you laugh. Bad Santa's mixing of the comedy and serious drama genre works very well, and while it may not cause holiday cheer, it's sure to please the Scrooges who dread the holiday season. Humbug.Starring: Billy Bob Thornton, Tony Cox, Bernie Mac, Lauren Graham, John Ritter, and Cloris Leachman. Directed by: Terry Zwigoff.",Bad Santa
26,Smells_Like_Cheese,It has it's moments,6,28 July 2004,"""Bad Santa"" does deliver it's title. I wanted to see this movie so badly because the trailer was very funny. But I figured this is a movie not worth spending 7 bucks on, so I'd wait for the rent. I'm glad I waited for the rent. There are some very funny moments in the film, but it does have a lot of dirty humor. Some humor I can stand, but it seems like ""Bad Santa"" was trying a little hard. I thought Billy Bob did a great job and I loved his character, but the rest of the cast doesn't add up. The kid and Willy were the only people you could get into. Over all, it's not a bad film. In fact, I wouldn't mind seeing it again. But it's not the comedy of the year.6/10",Bad Santa
27,=G=,Excellent casting,7,23 June 2004,"He drinks and smokes and pukes and wets his pants and has sex in public places. He has a horrible attitude, a trash mouth, is mean to little kids, hates himself, and robs department stores. Ok, so he's not all bad, but he is without a doubt the worst department store Santa ever. There's not a lot of stretching required of Thornton to get into character in this flick which capitalizes on the grosser than gross sense of comedy/humor as it wends its way through a simple tale about a scamming Santa and his dwarf/elf sidekick who rip off a department store a year to avoid honest toil. A mildly creative love it or hate it flick which tries as hard to be disgusting as funny, ""Bad Santa"" has, for obvious reasons, received mixed reviews. Only for the thick skinned who aren't easily offended by bad language, bad attitudes, or bad, bad Santas.  (B)",Bad Santa
28,DKosty123,The Anti-Christmas Movie,7,27 November 2016,"If there were ever a movie that is not the usual holiday movie, this is the one. Tony Cox elf is a classic example of that as he is not one who you want to be near children. Billy Bob Thorton is not a Santa for children either as he appears to dislike them more than anyone. Yet he has a boy adopt him here in a strange sort of way.With Bernie Mac and the deceased John Ritter here, this movie has grown enough in stature that it has finally be sequel ed. While Thorton carries this, and the release was not long after the shock of Ritter's on TV set sudden death, it is still the standard among ""R"" Rated holiday films.That is not to say it is the best holiday film to watch. It is not perfect. It is an evil sinful delight of a film that plays against the traditional holiday film in many many ways. The folks around Thorton are just as far off as you can possibly imagine. Yet this movie works, and you have to see it to understand why.Bleep, Bleep, Bleep",Bad Santa
29,Red-Barracuda,"Ah, the spirit of Christmas...",6,30 December 2010,"Bad Santa is probably the best film about an alcoholic Santa and midget elf sidekick who rob shopping malls. The comedy is black and it certainly isn't a typical Christmas film but perhaps that was the point. This is probably a film aimed at an alternative festive audience; very likely for those who don't really like Christmas all that much. Billy Bob Thornton is certainly convincing as the unpleasant central character. Seemingly he was drunk on set a great deal of the time. It's not surprising. He is perfectly cast as a bad tempered jakey. The other character who stands out in the film is the fat kid played by Brett Kelly. I don't know anything about this actor but his performance was very good. His scenes with Thornton were often borderline wrong, with the Bad Santa shouting and swearing at him. Kind of unusual to see a little kid being exposed to this sort of thing in a movie but Brett Kelly never once flinches. The chemistry between these two was definitely rather odd. Ultimately, that's what this film is too. It's a crime-comedy with not so much crime, and a comedy that is so bleak that it isn't always very funny; while as a Christmas movie it doesn't really fit anyone's idea of a normal festive film. But with all this in mind, it's a good alternative to the usual fare. Even if the ending is a bit of a cop-out.",Bad Santa
30,disdressed12,"Badder Santa,the unrated version",10,20 December 2008,"i really enjoyed this Christmas movie that's actually the ultimate anti Christmas movie i have seen.by that,i don't mean it's against Christmas.i mean it's totally the opposite of what you would normally think of as A Christmas movie.it's rude,crude,offensive,totally inappropriate and absolutely a riot.this is definitely not your father's Christmas movie,that's for sure.it's loaded with vulgar and/or offensive dialogue,and shows Santa in a much darker light.i guess you'd call him the anti Santa.it's bold,and brash,and pushes all kinds of envelopes without apology.it has the beautiful and talented Lauren Graham,from The TV series,The Gilmore girls.this character is a total departure from that character,pretty much the exact opposite in fact.yet Graham is so skilled that i never once thought about Gilmore Girls.and she is very funny.Billy Bob Thornton plays the title character and is hysterical.the supporting cast is also great,including Tony Cox,Bernie Mac,John Ritter.i should also mention the writing and the dialogue,which are brilliant.the dialogue is witty an fresh.but be warned,if you are someone who gets easily offended,avoid this movie.if not,sit back and laugh you're a$s off.a very enthusiastic 10/10",Bad Santa
31,cherold,the cure for heartwarming Xmas flicks,7,8 December 2003,"Very funny, fun movie that was well worth seeing. Not brilliant, but quite funny. Ending is absurd and unconvincing, but we can be charitable and assume they're poking fun at the typical happy endings of Xmas movies. And of course it's absurd to think bad santa would ever be able to hold a job as Santa for more than a day, but they wouldn't have a movie without a little suspension of disbelief.I hate to say it, but I think the biggest mistake the movie made (and it's not a very big mistake) was casting Lauren Graham as the girl. I love Lauren Graham, I would marry her in a second, she's cute and sweet and that made it utterly absurd that she would throw herself at a disheveled drunk. She's also the only main character who's not a caricature, and you can't just have one token normal person in a movie of weirdos. The part would have made a lot more sense with an actress like Laura Dern or Juliette Lewis who can seem a little weird, someone who might seem cracked enough to feel a bond with Billy Bob. You wouldn't need to rewrite the script, just change the actress, or get Lauren to be less cute and sweet and normal seeming (and yeah, I know there are people who are super normal seeming who are total freaks, but that's hard to show in a movie, and this movie didn't have the time or inclination to flesh out the character). It was just too weird to have Lauren hit on this guy and unquestioningly enter his world.But it's a small part so it doesn't do a lot of damage, and she is darn cute, but I can't believe this is how the part was originally imagined.",Bad Santa
32,sol-kay,Don't get me wrong.. I was against the Clinton impeachment!,6,30 December 2009,"***SPOILERS*** Things were going pretty good for shopping mall Santa Wilie, Billy Bob Thorton, as his little helper the midget or elf Marcus, Tony Cox, over the last five years with them ending up robbing the very shopping malls that they worked in. With Willie a master safe-cracker as well as a hopeless alcoholic and Marcus despite his sized, of 3 foot 7 inches, the big brain of the duo there's wasn't a chance these two would ever get caught by the police since they were always one step ahead of them. After knocking off a mall of all it's profits they just skipped town laid low and waited for next Christmas and a new shopping mall, where the local police don't know them, to both work at and rob.It's when Willie and Marcus staked out their latest heist at the Phoenix Mall that things started to turn sour against them. It's not that the mall officials were on to them it was that Willie suddenly got stung with the spirit of Christmas in the person of chubby 12 years old Thurman Merman, Brett Kelly, who mistook Wille for the real Santa Clause. With Willie doing everything to persuade Therman, also known as ""The Kid"", not to look up to him by him constantly using the ""F"" word and drinking himself numb, to the point where he wets his Santa outfit, the ""Kid"" just couldn't disbelieve that he wasn't the real Santa! There's also lady bartender Sue, Lauren Graham, a Santa groupie who tended the bar that Willie spent most his time and money in who, despite him being smashed and puking all over the place, was just absolutely crazy about the guy! With Christmas now almost at hand and criminal master-mind Marcus planning to rob the shopping mall on Christmas Eve he realizes that his partner in crime Willie has gone a bit soft in the head and is more of a liability then asset to him.***SPOILERS*** Somewhat contrived ending with Willie getting cold feet and Marcus, planning ahead of time, setting him up to get whacked by him and his new found crime partner Lois, Lauren Tom, after they rip off the mall at the stroke of midnight Christmas Eve. Uneven black comedy in that it's hard to really feel sorry for the fractured hero in it Willie who's non-stop drinking and fornicating, a word that he doesn't know the meaning of, is anything but heroic. Despite his sudden change of heart more then halfway though the film Willie never seemed to really clean himself up only until, as Marcus & Lois turned against him, he's faced with circumstances that were beyond his control.P.S there's also in the movie John Ritter as the straight as an arrow Phoenix Shopping Mall manager Bob Chipeska in what turned out to be the last motion picture he was to star in. An almost unrealizable Ritter was such a wimp and so afraid of both Willie and especially Marcus that he came across far more of a guilty party in the crimes that they committed! By him being so scared out of his wits to do anything about stopping them Ritter, or Bob Chipeska, not only allowed but even encouraged Willie and Marcus to commit them!",Bad Santa
33,Robert_duder,One of the darkest most messed up comedies ever,7,16 January 2015,"You should know exactly what to expect going into Bad Santa. For some it has become something a modern day Christmas classic for adults and people were always shocked when I said I hadn't seen it. So this year I decided to give it a try. It isn't easy to make a film with main characters that are meant to be truly unlikable and horrible human beings. Bad Santa is exactly that. Willie is a deplorable person and a criminal to boot. This is the sort of character that you won't ever necessarily ""root"" for. Instead you have to find the middle ground where you can laugh at the absolute absurdity about how awful he is. The film makers decided to aim for an empathy vote. Willie might be horrible but he's also so messed up and pathetic that you can't help feel sorry for the guy. The comedy in this film is so black you wouldn't be able to see it in the dark. You have to really be prepared for this sort of adult comedy. Some people would find it too black. I think I'd heard enough about the film to know what I was in for. Its a heist movie, its Christmas-y enough (obviously he plays a Santa) and it uses awkward situations with children and Willie's penchant for being always drunk (apparently Billy Bob Thorton did some method acting when it came to this and was actually drunk) and the moral of the story is so paper thin that it'll make you laugh in itself.Love him or hate him, Billy Bob Thorton is a very versatile actor. However, I feel like roles like this are closest to what he is most comfortable doing. He just likes being a jerk and he fits the role very well. This is a tough role because he can't take this already extreme role too far or you'll hate him (Cameron Diaz ala Bad Teacher...a terrible film of similar idea) You don't hate him. You feel sorry for him and he's very entertaining at being darkly comedic. He's perfectly suited for this part. Tony Cox is amazing as Willie's sidekick. He's clearly the brains of the operation and he is a little more composed mentally. Its hard to see why the two work together and yet they work so well together. Cox and Thorton have great chemistry. Brett Kelly is amazing as the overweight and rather pathetic kid that Thorton cons and ends up with a very bizarre friendship with. Their chemistry is fantastic too and Kelly works at being the butt of a lot of jokes. Lauren Graham seems like a very strange choice to me for Thorton's love interest but she is actually very good and while her character is underdeveloped, her and Thorton are good together and it works. Bernie Mac and John Ritter are decent in small supporting roles, both very underused and underdeveloped. It seemed weird to see Ritter playing such a laid back sort of comedy role. I still miss him a great deal.People love Bad Santa because its edgy. There are a few adult Christmas comedies out there but nothing with as much edge as this has. Its very jaded and dark and twisted and it works and the cast is very good at bringing all that to a head. Director Terry Zwigoff has done a good job but honestly I think almost any director could have pulled this off because the cast knows what they are doing, its a straight forward and obvious script and maybe even just a tad predictable but Zwifoff holds it together well and weaves a good tale. You definitely don't want to expose kids to this but if its all adults and you are in for some genuine shock comedy then check this one out. It wasn't mind blowing by any means but it was decent. 7/10",Bad Santa
34,paul2001sw-1,Merry (not happy) Christmas,7,3 November 2010,"Director Terry Zwigoff's 'Bad Santa' is the Christmas movie to end all Christmas movies, the story of Billy Bob Thornton's alcoholic, depressed, safe-cracking Father Christmas. Thornton is a great fit for the role and in places it's very funny, although in others it seems merely profane. Still, perhaps that's the right side to stray on in a Christmas film; and although there's a hint of redemption in the ending, it's only a very small hint. Don't watch it with your kids (although they'd probably love it!). And check out Zwigoff's excellent 'Ghost World' too, which similarly avoids the feel-good clichés of its genre.",Bad Santa

This movie looked appealing to me because Billy Bob Thornton is in the movie and he is a fine actor.This movie is about a fake Santa who got a job in a mall. This is not your normal Santa. He cusses, drinks, and talk smack in front of the little kids. Also he's part of a heist that involves stealing things everyday. He must learn the importance between naughty and nice when he meets The Kid.The acting was better than I expected. Billy Bob Thornton of course did an excellent job. Tony Cox is absolutely hilarious as the midget. The lates John Ritter and Bernie Mac were amazing.

37,CuriosityKilledShawn,Suffocatingly Hilarious,10,4 December 2004,"For far too long we've been denied a decent Xmas movie, one that can become an annual tradition. There are movies like Christmas Vacation, Scrooged and Home Alones 1 and 2 that you have to watch every year. Bad Santa is now, definitely one of those movies.Billy plays Willie, a shopping mall Santa who is the sleaziest and filthiest scumbag ever. The kind we all aspire to be. A man who would rather pee himself than be bothered getting up to go to the john. He loathes kids (as we all do) and the Santa thing is only a front for robbing the mall on Christmas Eve. It's the same old scam him and his midget pal have been pulling for years. Only this year it's all about to change.Santa meets a fat, retarded kid who likes to ask LOADS of questions and seemingly lives alone in a massive, empty house (grandma is everything but dead). Seizing the opportunity, Santa moves in and ends up being a (very, very, very reluctant, surrogate father) for the kid (charmingly named Thurman Murman).But this ain't no tale of redemption. Santa maintains his sleaziness and keeps on drinking, drinking, drinking...though he does manage to get a totally hot girlfriend.There is some nice support from Bernie Mac and the late John Ritter (as a fan I especially appreciated the appropriate tribute to him at the end) but it's the kid who ends up being the one who steals the scene with his glazed, dead-eye look and unending, never-ever ending questions. Come on, what other character has mortally wounded themselves carving out a wooden pickle for an Xmas present?I suppose I have no option but to buy the Badder Santa unrated DVD coz more of this movie will always be better. Willie is no Kris Kringle but that doesn't mean this movie isn't suitable for kids. I would still love this film even if I were 10 years old. Sure there's lots of swearing in it but point out one kid to me that won't swear when he/she grows up.If sickening sugary rubbish like Miracle on 54th Street and Home Alone 86 are making you suicidal then watch Bad Santa. The real miracle is how a film this foul can end up being so endearing.",Bad Santa
38,ironhorse_iv,Bad Santa is really not that bad. It's honestly pretty good. I kinda like this movie.,7,26 December 2019,"This holiday dark comedy stars Billy Bob Thornton as an alcoholic bitter & depress criminal Willie Stokes who works with his dwarf assistant Marcus Skidmore (Tony Cox) as Mall Santa in order to gain access to rob the mall on Christmas Eve. However they soon run into trouble when Strokes starts to rethink his life after befriending a naive innocent child, Thurman Merman (Brett Kelly) who assumes Willie is really the real jolly St. Nick. Without spoiling the flick directed by Terry Zwigoff too much. With extreme violent, excessive profanity, sexual innuendo and lots of drug use, this film is probably not the best Christmas flick to show to children during the holiday season. It's the polar opposite, suitable only for adult viewers. Anybody with eyes can see that with the very obvious title. Bad Santa means Bad Santa. Thornton really does live up to the job title with his repulsive foul mouthed, drunk & promiscuity character even if it seems like he's not acting much different than what he does in real life in the eyes of the public. In truth at the time while Thornton does struggles with liquor and was genuinely intoxicated during some of scenes. One thing he did take seriously was his health toward food. He follow a very strict vegan diet and avoided junk food as he is allergic to wheat and dairy. Hints why Stokes is mostly seen eating salad in the film. While it might seem out of character for the criminal not consume fatty foods. Thornton does makes the salad eating works with spitting out greens when yelling at people. I never once saw a person look so ugly looking when chomping on the stuff. Nevertheless this role gave him the persona of the wasted up antihero that he would later be typecast as in films such as 2005 'Bad News Bear'. Like that, this movie also paint his character enough with decent qualities so that the audience wouldn't be turn off by the individual's mostly selfish offensive actions and mental health issues. Under Dimension Films, with Glenn Ficarra and John Requa writing the screenplay, they made Stokes into a somewhat of a likeable character by having him interact more with Thurman in a fatherly matter than the directors or the producers the Coen Brother's version of the script. It really help the movie a lot. The on-screen chemistry between Kelly and Thornton was surprising very good. The way Thurman doesn't reacted to Strokes negative bellowing while keeping his innocent dumb founded look is pretty damn funny. Kelly was an amazing child actor. That's why the original version is a lot better than the Director's cut or the Unrated Version that focus too much on several pointless scenes of non-needed for the plot Lauren Tom character scouting the stores for loot or offensive jokes that doesn't land like the out of the blue parking lot attacked by a Hindustani hoodlum played by Ajay Naidu. Regardless in nearly all versions, the movie does take a little bit too long to establish Stokes backstory. Honestly did we need the opening monologue nor those vacations scenes in Miami, Florida? It felt out of place and not needed, seeing how things get repeated by Marcus quite often about his troubles. Those moments felt like filler. Nevertheless, I felt the same way with the relationship Strokes had with the nympho bartender Sue (Lauren Graham). It didn't really led much to anything. Also the relationship was really hard to believe as the character of Willie is completely repulsive and doesn't really look like Santa. Plus, its' not like he's loyal to her. He still sleeps around. Regardless, the actress did a good job with her limited one dimensional pixie maniac girl dream girl role. As for Strokes relationship with Marcus. I found Cox & Thornton to have great chemistry as partners in crime. The way Cox reaction in shock and disgust of Willie's actions felt real. Even with his intense scenes with Bernie Mac character of Gin Slagel Mall Security seem genuine. I love that moment when Gin whispers 'half'. I get goosebumps every time. Bernie Mac was equally as impressive. He does seem intimidating during the first half. I just wish the screenwriters didn't make him look like an idiot in the last part of the film because it killed compelling smart top of his game look that Mac was really reaching for in the beginning. As for John Ritter as the mall's general manager Mr. Chipeska. He shines as the upright prissy highly anxious foil to the duo's schemes. It's just sad that Ritter died, just a few months after taking this role. Glad to see that this film was dedicated to the actor. I also did that both the beginning and end play Chopin's ""Nocturne'. It sounds so peaceful after all the chaotic. Overall: This movie found just the right tone for its dark, vulgar humor that its 2016 sequel fail to do. There's no question that some viewers will still find 'Bad Santa' to crude and irreverent. But while some might be shocked and disgusted, others will find themselves laughing all the way through this unconventional Christmas tale. For those like me that like it. I say go fix some sandwiches & see this movie. This is one St. Nick that doesn't deserves to be eternally banished to the icy nether regions of the North Pole.",Bad Santa

I so love this movie and it's amazing that Billy Bob Thornton really got drunk for the role.",Bad Santa
40,Floated2,Offers right but not for everyone,8,26 December 2015,"Bad Santa is not a movie for everyone which is what makes the film a great Christmas classic. Bad Santa started as a concept by its executive producers Joel and Ethan Coen, who turned their idea over to John Requa and Glenn Ficarra, the screenwriters of the edgy kids' movie Cats & Dogs.Started off as a career criminal Willie T. Soke (Billy Bob Thornton) has found himself the perfect profession. As one may put it, he just has to work three weeks every year to keep himself in all the booze, cigarettes he needs for the other 49 weeks of the year. Willie is a mall Santa whose partner in all things criminal is dwarf named Marcus (Tony Cox). Marcus has three important jobs: He plays Santa's elf and keeps Willie just sober enough to snarl at the kids who come to the malls' North Pole castles.Others may find it stale, while the reviews have been overwhelming great and the film is just popular today, even more so than when it was released back in 2003, now after watching it on Christmas day 2015. The greater of Bad Santa is that it's unrelentingly and unapologetically delightful.

After a rewatch 12/27/18' Bad Santa still remains quite a decent and funny thrill dark comedy. Filled with a lot of good dark humor and interesting designs, one remembered some scenes, then overall a lot of differences between the original and Bad Santa 2. Bad Santa seems to have more heart and a greater message, where as the sequel simply throws anything in its way to get ""shock value"". As stated before, these films are not for everyone.",Bad Santa

All I do know is that this movie is good.It's funny in many parts and it can also be pretty dramatic.But this certainly isn't for children's eyes.A drunken and swearing Santa isn't something they want to see or should see.But for adult audiences Bad Santa can be a splendid movie to watch.Merry Christmas everybody!,Bad Santa
42,damianphelps,Just Another Xmas Movie? .....Hell No!,9,8 November 2020,"This is a classic movie that should be part of everyone's Christmas festivities.A perfect movie for Billy Bob to showcase his comedic skills.Funny, crass, ridiculous and brilliant.One of the best Xmas movies EVER!! :)",Bad Santa
43,insomniac_rod,Great dark comedy that works because of Thornton's wicked performance.,7,5 February 2006,"If you enjoy dark humor please give this movie a chance. It's mindless fun.Everyone knows the plot. And I think that this movie is all about Billy Bob Thornton's performance. The man shines and shows his skills as a sarcastic comedy actor. The way he expresses his repulsion against life overall in such a sarcastic way is hilarious. The portrayal of a man that hates his work (even that the job is supposed to bring ""happiness"") is a representation of frustration of the lower class. Also, the portrayal of the abuse of alcohol and sex addiction is shown in a crude but comical way. There are some jokes that have to do with physical discrimination and race but I wouldn't consider them as major or very offensive. If you think the opposite, I apologize. Most of the scenes are filled with raw humor and hilarious performances by Thornton, Cox, and Mack. The kid was hilarious in his own way. Excellent acting that needed actors with comedic skills; not dramatic actors who felt funny.Anyways, I would recommend this movie for people who can take raw humor and mean jokes. It's a mindless dark comedy with great performances. My favorite scene is where Billy Bob comes to his job totally intoxicated while children and their mothers watch him in repulsion as he gets off the electric stairs. Then he says (totally drunk) ""I peed myself"". I like that scene mainly because it's the perfect way to describe Willie. Some scenes tell you more than 1000 words. But the movie is not all about crude humor; it has only a message towards the end. Willie demonstrates he has feelings and that he isn't that bad overall. I liked the final scene where he manages to give the kid the pink elephant even though he's shot by police. It was a great scene because it mixed different emotions. My respects to Billy Bob who once again demonstrates that he can portray ANY role. He kind of reminded me of the Al Bundy character.",Bad Santa
44,Anonymous_Maxine,Yes. VERY bad.,3,26 January 2004,"First of all, I am a HUGE fan of Billy Bob Thornton. He is without a doubt one of my favorite actors working today, but with Bad Santa he illustrates, unfortunately, that even he is capable of providing a wonderful performance in an awful, awful movie. The abysmal script for Bad Santa calls for a relentlessly unlikable, distasteful person, and Billy Bob does more than necessary to fill that requirement. He is a remarkably versatile actor, I can't help being reminded of the diversity of such roles as the government official in Armageddon, the greasy mechanic in U-Turn, the intense racist in Monster's Ball, the rather slow brother in the shocking film A Simple Plan, and the peculiar character that he played in Sling Blade.
Unfortunately, the fact that Billy Bob is among the most powerful actors acting today is not enough to add something to the empty script of Bad Santa, which scarcely has any more reason for existence than do the ridiculous Scary Movies, which are abysmally awful films which I am notorious for repeatedly badmouthing - and for good reason - in dozens of my other reviews.(spoilers) Billy Bob Thornton plays the part of a dedicated drunk named Willie (who deserves no last name and so is given none) who plays the part of the shopping mall Santa Claus once a year, with his sidekick Marcus (Tony Cox who cleverly gets upset at being called ""you people,"" something which he hasn't done since Me, Myself, and Irene. These writers are so creative!!!). Marcus and Willie do not do the job because they enjoy it or because they are interested in earning a little extra cash for the holidays, they do it because being employees at the mall gains them access to the mall after closing. Marcus hides somewhere, then jumps out of hiding as the last security guard arms the alarm and walks out of the mall. Marcus jumps out and disarms the alarm before it can arm completely (thus eliminating the annoying need for a code or password), and he then lets Willie in from where he has been waiting somewhere outside. The two proceed to rob the mall blind.Thus enters the premise which allows room for the comedic content, if you can call it that, of the film. Willie's an alcoholic who apparently survives the rest of the year on the money that he steals from one mall after another on his nationwide bad Santa sprees. Since he makes all of his money from stealing from the malls, it's not hard to see that he's not going to really enjoy being surrounded by slobbering kids all day since he is not interested in the hourly wage in the first place. Thus follows lots of groan-inducing streams of profanity sprayed at unsuspecting kids and their equally unsuspecting parents.Now, the profanity is one thing. It got real old real quick, but it's still, as they say, just one thing. Then you have the fact that Willie is constantly falling over drunk, smashing empty booze bottles against fancy SUVs in the parking lot on his way into the mall, and a whole array of other hideous infractions of basic decency. When I think about the character of Willie from this movie, I'm reminded of Melvin Udall from As Good As It Gets whose communication with the world, as Roger Ebert noted, was `limited to insults intended to harm.' But Jack Nicholson provided a charm to the character that I believe Billy Bob could also have provided Willie, had this ridiculous script called for it even in the most distant way. I'm also reminded of Billy from Buffalo '66, another hideously unattractive and straight-forwardly mean person who displayed the social skills I expect must have been common sometime around the Cretaceous Period, but Billy was an ugly person in a movie that was also deliberately ugly. It was a compilation of cinematic skill that made Buffalo '66 (and Billy) look and act the way it/he did. Bad Santa is ugly and mean because the humor is simply bad.
If I were to summarize, I would just say that if you are entertained by seeing an aging drunk screaming streams of profanity at a preteen boy for a HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE MINUTES, then PLEASE watch this movie, you are sure to enjoy it. Personally, I think that there are some things that simply have no place in modern mainstream entertainment. Mostly all of them can be found conveniently compiled in the Scary Movies (which collectively play like a `What Not To Do' list for aspiring filmmakers), but there are plenty more examples found here in Bad Santa.While I didn't HATE the movie, I can't help automatic feelings of surprise and disbelief whenever I hear anyone say that they enjoyed it, even on a basal level. The movie is so callous and so ugly and so uncomfortable that even the good elements, like the fact that Willie supposedly is `changed' for the better (really, could he possibly have been changed for the WORSE?) by the little boy who inexplicably falls in love with him, are not enough to counter the intense ugliness of the character of Willie himself.
Ugly movies can be successful and impressive (epitomized most recently, I think, in the case of Buffalo '66), but violence, alcohol, extensive criminal activities, and mass quantities of profanity mixed with the almost constant presence of young children is the absolute extent to which an ugly film can go horribly, horribly wrong. Personally, I always find it a little bit sad that filmmakers think that modern American audiences would be entertained by something like this. Even more than that, I find it sad that, a lot of times, they're right.",Bad Santa

Another one was Silent Night Deadly Night, where this one is a guilty pleasure comedy, and again not for kids. BBT is one lucky son of a bitch, when you see the women he scores with in this. Bad Santa is a winner on a roll, it's rude, sexy, immoral, and downright right funny. Don't underestimate how funny this film is. It will surprise ya. BBT, that great actor is perfect here, right in his element as a boozing ex con loser. Him and his foul mouthed midget accomplice, work every Xmas doing that gig for all the kiddies, then robbing the store blind, to finance their next year of relaxation and pleasure, something that BBT revels in. This Christmas Billy Bob, stumbles upon this safe in this big house, unbeknown to him, is currently tenanted by an old woman and her little overweight grandson, the butt of ridicule and torment by a group of bullies. But victory is sweet for him him at the end and tenderly painful for the head thug. BB has a lot of vices, and he takes these to his work role too. He's the worst and baddest Santa, ever, especially on lunch breaks. God knows what the little actors who sat on his lap felt like. His midget assistant, I've never heard so much blasphemy spouted out of a little mouth. The store owner, the late Bernie Mac, finding out about this little enterprise, cuts himself a greedy slice of the action, where his demise is a vengeful delight. Willie (Thornton) ends up taking permanent residence at the little boy's house where a friendship does develop, something I really like in the story, that does have a bit of heart, but not much. BB sort of inadvertently comes off as a father figure, where in between, he's sharing sexy interludes with a barmaid (Graham). He does some other hot numbers too, one quite young for him, jailbait material, at a pinball machine. I do admit at times, the chubby kid gets a little annoying, though. Bad Santa is not for all tastes. If you like a lot of expletives, some sexy women, and want a lot of laughs, this is the film for you. The late John Ritter as a store employee, shares one hilarious scene, carried on brief responses he shares with Mac. Ritter's physical state here isn't hilarious, where he was in the final stages of his illness, and like Mac, is not with us now, but both of these good actors won't be forgotten, but this film won't be too.",Bad Santa

48,dfranzen70,Coulda been badder.,5,19 July 2004,"Not quite as good as I'd hoped it would be. Billy Bob Thornton plays a con man who, with his vertically challenged pal (Tony Cox), plays a department-store Santa for a month out of the year - and then robs the store at Christmas.Thornton's Willie isn't a good guy in any sense of the word. He's an alcoholic, he cusses like a sailor, he pisses himself, and he's unshaven. He treats others like dirt, he's lascivious, he's perverted. No class act, this one. That is, until one of the little kids in line to see Santa (known only as Kid) strikes some kind of chord with Willie, as little kids in movies are wont to do. The good news is that it does take a while for the kid to win over Willie. The bad news is that it happens at all - or, at least, that it's handled rather clumsily. Sure, it's a comedy, but the Coen brothers were the executive producers. As with Intolerable Cruelty, the brothers simply didn't know what to do with this film; was it a laugh-out-loud comedy? A feel-good picture? A dark comedy? It could have wound up being any of those, but instead it was all three at different points in the film.None of the characters was particularly well drawn, but since the focus was on Willie, this isn't a huge debit. Thornton's not bad, but Cox easily steals the show from him as his blue-talking partner. There were a few belly laughs in the movie, mostly from Cox's lines, but by and large this one missed the mark.",Bad Santa
49,dee.reid,A little Christmas cheer... BLAAH (Hum-bug)!,10,16 August 2004,"The above does pretty much sum up the amount of Christmas cheer that is to be found in ""Bad Santa"" - if there is any Christmas cheer at all. And after reading that quote, it doesn't help much that ""Santa"" is in reality, an anagram of ""Satan,"" thus adding deeper irony to the title ""Bad Santa.""When watching Terry Zwigoff's ""Bad Santa,"" it helps to try to keep an open mind about what you're about to watch; this is not a movie for the children.This is one of the most twisted, sickest, and damned funniest movies I've ever seen; it's actually best that you DON'T watch this film on Christmas, as it will likely destroy any remaining optimism for those who already despise the holidays.""Bad Santa"" is funny in the same way that you laugh at the humor in ""RoboCop"" or ""The Evil Dead,"" in that you may find yourself laughing at one moment, and then later kicking yourself for doing so. I like the way that Roger Ebert commented in his review of ""Bad Santa,"" in stating that for Billy Bob Thornton to play the film's lead character ""Willie"" would be an act of career suicide, and that Thornton, ""...put the script to his head and pulled the trigger.""The story is pretty simple, since it isn't the film's main source of strength. Thornton plays Willie, a miserable, depressed, alcoholic conman who works as a department store Santa Claus. His partner is Marcus (Tony Cox), who is diminutive, and works as his assistant, foul-mouthed elf. Together, these two perform daring after-hour heists at whatever store they set up shop in. But this year will be pretty different for them, especially Willie.Willie's drinking is at an all-time worst, and Marcus is growing tired of it, as this is posing a problem for their ruse as a Santa and elf at an Arizona shopping mall that's managed by the overly sensitive Bob Chipeska (John Ritter, in his last screen performance). To make things worse, they've got a tough-as-nails security guard (Bernie Mac) after them, who eventually stumbles onto their plan and decides that he wants a share of the score. Willie meets Sue (Lauren Graham) and the two of them screw whenever, wherever - in the hot tub or his car; it hardly matters and Willie is being menaced by the Kid (Brett Kelly), who just shows up at the store one day and latches onto him like a leech. Before you know it, however, Willie has eventually taken up residence with the Kid and his barely-alive grandmother, and Willie begins to discover some much-needed Christmas cheer.It is true that ""Bad Santa"" is the movie that Santa Claus doesn't want you to see. Frankly I'm surprised that this film even made it out of the studio, being that some executive who could've been working under orders from his handlers didn't ""accidentally"" take a match to a reel of film that had the label ""Bad Santa"" written on it. Simply put, movies like ""Bad Santa"" either make or break careers; in this case it really doesn't do much of either, since somewhere in between, we seem to get a career best from Thornton, who appears drunk throughout the film and according to IMDb, was genuinely intoxicated during filming. How's that for a real performance?Parents should definitely take heed to the title ""Bad Santa""; that will be their first warning to steer clear. But you can't bother some parents these days, as it seems that they'll take their children to see anything, no matter if they're mature enough to handle it or not.With all this negative press that I'm bringing up about ""Bad Santa,"" one might get the impression that I loathed every minute of it and that I'm venting my frustrations here. Quite the contrary, I loved every minute of this masterpiece and I laughed myself stupid during some instances. This movie is destined for some kind of cult following.With ""Bad Santa,"" a new level of demented greatness has been achieved regarding Christmas-themed films. If you think hard about it, we actually need more movies like this with themes about our most beloved holiday of the year. Try to think of the darkly comedic situation that Denis Leary found himself with in 1994's ""The Ref,"" where he plays a burglar who makes the mistake of taking a bickering couple hostage on one turbulent night during the holiday season.That movie succeeded because it was funny, outrageous, and in some ways, at least to me, satirized family values and upper-class hypocrisy. ""Bad Santa"" is sort of the same way, except it's less tame and much more... rude.""Bad Santa"" is one of the best Christmas movies that I've ever seen and probably ever will see, that is until they make a movie that is actually about Santa Claus and how he is a drunken, foul-mouthed, bumbling fool.*** On a personal note, from reading all of this, one might get the impression that I hate the holidays. Quite the contrary again, I love Christmas; it's just that I rarely see good movies that destroy or mock popular beliefs about it.10/10",Bad Santa

52,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Unapologetically crass holiday fun,8,15 December 2015,"Terry Zwigoff's Bad Santa is as delightfully nasty as holiday comedies get, a hedonistic gut punch of dirty deeds and amoral lowlifes. Billy Bob Thornton is the lowest of them all as Willie, an alcoholic dirtbag criminal con man who poses as a mall santa every year just so he and his 'elf' partner in crime Marcus (everyone's favorite black midget, twitchy Tony Cox) can rob the department stores blind after hours. Willie is truly a glorious example of deplorable human behaviour. He's profane, crass and verbally nasty in almost every scene of the film, engaging in conduct so cringe worthy and sleazy that the laughs which come hard and fast are often at the expense of our consciences. Thornton is pitch perfect for the role, and not to sound mean but there's just something inherently sleazy about his demeanor that lends itself perfectly to playing pricks. Whether he's swearing at kids, banging a hooker in his santa suit or drinking himself into a holiday coma on an hourly basis, he's endless fun. Life throws him a curveball in the form of two fellow lost souls. Spunky bartender Lauren Graham, pissing on her goody Gilmore Girls image as a kinky chick with daddy issues as far as the eye can see and a thing for doing it with Willie while he's in the Santa Suit. He also meets a lonely, bullied kid with some kind of mental disposition that reminded me of Ralph from The Simpsons (Vancouver's own Brett Kelly). They show him that you can still be a marginally OK guy while doing nasty stuff, and you don't have to engage in appalling R rated antics alone. That's about all you'll get in the way of a 'message' from this one lol, it's just not that type of flick. Kudos to it for sticking to its boozy, stripper tassel guns and not deviating into sentimental mush. Throw in Bernie Mac as a preening mall detective and the late John Ritter as the moronic mall manager, and you've got a feel-bad holiday gem that's always worth a watch.

For some reason I was in the mood for something outrageous and at the same time ""Christmas-y"" so I chose this from our video store (it was the Unrated version known as ""BADDER SANTA""). I knew all about its spicy content way beforehand -- how Billy Bob Thornton is a mean and drunken loser who hates everyone and swears at kids while playing a store Santa Claus -- but the thing is, I expected it to be much funnier than it came off. Cruel and nasty can be humorous if done right, but this was just nonstop boring cussing and repetitious ugliness just for the sake of it. When Thornton meets and winds up living with a pathetic little fat boy who looks up to him, we expect that Bill Bob's going to be driven to change his ways and ultimately de-Scrooge himself... but while this transformation is hinted at here and there, he's really still just the same miserable a**hole until the bitter end. I got a chuckle or two when Bad Santa's dwarf friend, who's also his store elf, would tell him off and try to set him straight, but even that took a wrong turn later on. John Ritter (who died of aortic dissection the same year BAD SANTA was released) is pretty decent as the frazzled store manager, but he's got to be rolling over in his grave now to see that this lousy movie has a dedication to him at the end.

The kid that gets himself attached to Santa was very adorable,, yeah he was kinda annoying, all those questions, but really was a sweet kid. The movie was a little disjointed, meaning that it seemed like the writing didn't seem to be very contiguous, there wasn't a constant flow, but that aside, the story as a whole did flow well, the premise was average, but with lot's of comedy, Bernie Mac,, thought his role should have been bigger, the Elf character stole the show, lot's of racy humor in this one. now i love John Ritter, great t.v. actor but his last role, this film very dry, not John Ritter like. Anyhow Billy Bob Thorton was a laugh a minute to say the least, the unrated version will have you rooting and cheering for him, I loved the cute Bartender, his Mrs Santa's sister,, she was very cute, likable, very alluring, sexy, pleasure to watch her,, overall thumbs up, enjoyable holiday viewing, wouldn't recommend to under 13 years of age though.",Bad Santa

I tried to go in blind as I could to this movie, since I heard such good things about it. Sadly, it made no impact upon my viewing, and I found myself incredibly disappointed. Sure, I laughed a few times, the scene at the boxing ring was pretty funny, but there is hardly anything memorable or even worthwhile throughout this film. Its sense of humor is predictable and really lazy, doing the same joke over and over again, with forced swearing, forced obnoxiousness, and just plain stupidity. I feel like all the actors fit their roles, but the script made it hard to like anybody on screen, it just wasn't a pleasant film to watch. It had its entertaining moments, but often enough I found myself quite bored as the dull and depressing nature of the film just continued to repeat itself into the film finally decided to wrap up. In the end, I won't be watching Bad Santa again anytime soon. It lacks the intelligence, wit, and spirit that made so many other Christmas films, Christmas comedies, and just comedies in general as fun as they are to watch today.

A great consumer of alcoholic his attitude towards children is somewhat peculiar and almost always full of profanities. When his apartment is raided of what he thinks is the police, he moves in in a luxurious home were just a odd kid (Kelly) and his Grandma currently lives. An extremely odd relationship form between the two, Willie and the kid that is. And then there is Willies girlfriend Sue (Graham). Willie now finds himself in a complicated triangle drama consisting of a) his personal-life b) his ""professional"" life and c) alcohol. Things don't get easy.An interesting story were Thornton is perfect as Willie. It actually is a great performance (alcohol or not) that carries most of the movie. Sometimes the movie is hilarious, but unfortunately, that are mostly isolated scenes. Cox is also good as Willies partner Marcus and Kelly is also good as the peculiar kid. Graham as Sue is the only somewhat ""normal"" character and she too is good. However, that adjective describes most of the movie. It is good and interesting but not great. I do recommend it though, as an refreshing unique Christmas story (not for young children).7/10",Bad Santa
59,Boyo-2,Ask me if I stopped laughing,10,23 December 2004,"Without overstating it, this is the funniest movie in a long time. It destroys every other Christmas-themed movie with several thousand sledgehammers. Maybe it goes too far at times, but I literally could not believe how much I was enjoying this. Its really in a category by itself and for that reason alone I respect the hell out of it.Outrageous, raunchy and touching, all in 90 minutes is no small accomplishment. The movie is a masterpiece.I heard director Terry Zwigoff say that if Brett Kelly could walk and talk at the same time, he'd be in the movie. I don't know where they got the kid, but he's brilliant, like everything else. It can't have been easy to play the sweet kid without overdoing it, and what he accomplishes is nothing short of a miracle.I cannot overstate the value of this movie. Its over the top and touching, sometimes at the same time, and its a credit to all involved that it all works so well.Billy Bob is great and I'm not his biggest fan, but I sure am glad he was cast instead of Bruce Willis or some other drone. Tony Cox, Bernie Mac and the late great John Ritter make this one for the memory bank.Easily 10/10. It feels great to love a movie so much.",Bad Santa

I'm not a big lover of Christmas movies and American comedies don't fall high on my list of favourite movie genre's either, so by rights , Bad Santa should not have done much for me. Wrong! I loved it. Bad Santa is a fantastic comedy that had me laughing out loud several times. Billy Bob Thornton is not the most obvious choice for a Santa who drink and swears too much but he takes to the role perfectly. His Dwarf friend played by Tony Cox gets nearly all the funny lines and the two actors work together brilliantly. Bernie Mac is funny ( especially the eating the orange scene) and the Kid ( Bret Kelly ) is great. It's not often comedy films have as many funny scenes as Bad Santa does and Director Terry Zwigoff deserved a great deal of credit by getting Billy Bob Thornton to produce he's defining movie performance. Bad Santa is without doubt , up there as one of my favourite Christmas movies of all time. If you have not seen this before you must. Just don't show it to the kids!",Bad Santa

The reason is that i'm not a big fan of Christmas films and also i'm not a big fan of Billy Bob Thornton (only in The Man who wasn't there, that's a great performance). Finally about two months ago i buy the DVD of Crumb and i love it and well i buy also Bad Santa because is the same director. And i really like it. Great characters and really great humor with the style of the producers (Coen brothers) but i put 9 because with Billy B.

63,Sandcooler,Never gets old,8,24 December 2011,"At first sight ""Bad Santa"" probably looks like a one joke comedy, but at least the one joke seems built to last. Billy Bob Thornton playing Santa, it's so out there you're surprised they didn't think of it sooner. He drinks, he swears, he beats people up, and that's funny because he's Santa. There's a lot more to this movie though. Some of the lines are just pure genius, these writers didn't rely solely on their basic premise even though they totally could have. The movie's also pretty touching all in all, just not in a typical Hollywood sense. Teaming the main character up with a kid is sort of a Christmas movie cliché, but the idea definitely has its merits here. ""Bad Santa"" is not a typical family film, and that's where it gets all its strength.",Bad Santa
64,philip_vanderveken,Not exactly the Santa you are used to see in movies.,8,6 December 2004,"Bad Santa may well be the best Christmas movie I've ever seen. Not because of its exceptional qualities, but because it isn't as sugar sweet as all the other movies in the genre are. It certainly isn't the best movie I've ever seen, far from it. It's just too vulgar to be the best. Kicking in the crotch, spitting in someone's face, it may be very popular, but it isn't my kind of humor. So what is it that appealed so much to me in this movie? Well, the main reason why I like it is because Thornton really plays the worst Santa possible. He drinks, he smokes, he swears, he steals... He does everything you wouldn't expect from a man playing Santa Clause. No sugar sweet crap about a man who loves all children and wants to give a poor kid the best Christmas he has ever had... No, this Santa is mean and he doesn't want to change that attitude. I love it! But the movie has it's downsides too. As I already mentioned, it is very vulgar from time to time. But that's not the only problem. Of course our dear Santa will get to know a kid that will learn him the true Christmas spirit, making this movie not that much different from the other Christmas movies. The ending may not be exactly what you'll expect to see, but the producers should have gone further if you ask me... Even though I don't think it's the best movie ever, I still liked it. I give it a 7.5/10 because it tries to break some boundaries. It doesn't always succeed, but at least it tries...",Bad Santa
65,Christmas-Reviewer,Not For Children,8,19 March 2017,"BEWARE OF BOGUS REVIEWS. SOME REVIEWERS HAVE ONLY ONE REVIEW TO THEIR NAME. NOW WHEN ITS A POSITIVE REVIEW THAT TELLS ME THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH THE FILM. IF ITS A NEGATIVE REVIEW THEN THEY MIGHT HAVE A GRUDGE AGAINST THE PRODUCTION. NOW I HAVE REVIEWED OVER 200 HOLIDAY THEME MOVIES. I HAVE NO AGENDA. I AM FARE.The story of this film is Willie T. Soke and his assistant Marcus Skidmore are professional thieves. Every year, Willie disguises himself as a department store Santa Claus and Marcus disguises himself as an elf in order for both of them to rob the store at night, using Marcus' wife Lois as their getaway driver and accomplice. Marcus takes his duty as an elf seriously, but Willie is a sex-addicted alcoholic, and is gradually unable to perform his Santa duties appropriately with children, plus likewise a diminish in his safe-cracking performance, much to Marcus' dismay. When they are hired at the Saguaro Square Mall in Phoenix the following year, the vulgar remarks made by Willie shock the prudish mall manager Bob Chipeska, who brings them to the attention of security chief Gin Slagel.Now this film has had 4 different cuts. 1) The Theatrical Cut 2) Unrated Extended Edition (Aka Bader Santa) 3) The Director's Cut 4) The Television CutNow my preferred version of this film is the ""Unrated Bader Santa"" edition. This film is funny! It is mean spirited at times but it is not trying at all to be a ""Politically Correct Hallmark Movie"".Billy Bob Thornton is very good in the role. However the late John Ritter and Bernie Mac are gold here! Lauren Tom is unrecognizable here but she is funny! There is several upsetting images in this film but if you have a funny bone and you want to laugh then watch. Watch this Anytime of the year. It will make you laugh.",Bad Santa
66,screenman,Yo-Ho-Yuch!,4,12 December 2008,"'Bad Santa' looks like a rather gross and surreal take on 'A Christmas Story', whereby an irrevocable cynic finds rehabilitation.Maybe there's an Anglo/American culture issue here, but for me the concept failed. Santa struck me as being just a bit too bad.Problems arise with the character himself. Nobody with such a miserable, embittered outlook could possibly have got the job. And even supposing he had jumped that hurdle, there would soon have been so many complaints from customers that the sack ('scuse the pun) would have been inevitable. All the nonsense about morally blackmailing the manager over discrimination against the ethnic dwarf simply didn't stack-up. The elf wasn't the problem; Santa was. Keep the one and sack the other. With paedophilia so much to the fore these days, it is almost certain that Santa would have been under video-surveillance, if only to counter any bogus law-suits. That evidence would just as easily have served to get rid of him. Another thing; anybody with such chronic depression and alcohol dependency as Billy Bob Thornton's character, would be highly unlikely to retain such a manifest libido, let alone arouse interest from the opposite sex. Most women, I believe, would have found him pathetic, smelly and repulsive. One suspects that female tastes were not consulted in this tiresome 'GQ' bloke-joke.Okay; it was supposed to be a comedy, and that requires a certain suspension of belief and objective criticism. But this 'comedy' was so close to the knuckle as to almost pass for reality - rather like Ricky Gervais's characters (who manage to be hilarious without the least bad language). Like many of the critics, I found Santa's gross-out behaviour and foul language a little uncomfortable at first. But for me, it just became too much. The screwing and swearing got to be so repetitive that - like any other repeated 'joke' - it quickly dissolved and simply left a bad taste. Once was enough. I have no moral axe to grind against swearing per-se; when executed with flair or conviction like Tarantino's characters, bad language adds an extra dimension to drama. But here; its continuous employment as a character trait 'gag' soon wore thin.Also, I was expecting some kind of heist plot. This was billed as such. But instead, the 'Bad Santa' routine just went on and on, with the abortive robbery taking place in about the last 5 minutes of the movie. It was as if the director had become so infatuated with bad taste that he'd forgotten the plot himself.And that's about it. Billy Bob Thornton et al turned in very capable performances for a script whose humour rested largely in fulmination, insults and bickering. I've given 4 stars to them. The rest of it simply wasn't worth watching let alone making. Give me Dickens' original anytime.Parents should be very clearly warned; This is not fit for kids.",Bad Santa
67,Lady_Targaryen,Get Naughty this Holiday Season.,6,29 December 2005,"''Bad Santa''...well,how can I start to talk about this movie? Billy Bob Thornton plays Willie, a politically incorrect Santa Claus who hates himself and his life and together with Marcus,they rob each establishment they work. But Willie's life is about to change when he meets a 8 years old kid named Thurman and a woman called Sue (Lauren Graham, from th Gilmore Girls), who has a fetish in Santa Claus. Although I like black/dark humor, I didn't like this movie very much because with few exceptions,it didn't make me laugh. The best about this movie, is his final message, when Willie seems to feel finally happy and with objectives in his life.The little fat blonde kid steals the show!",Bad Santa

This movie was great and it was shocking at the same time. I was just sitting here at home when it came on the encore channel. Now Evereybody Loves Raymond is on, but let's move on. What really kept me interested was that fat kid. The best scene was when (spoiler) the bad Santa kicks that one kids butt. Yes, that was actually one of many good scenes. Would Jake like this? I think so. Since we both have a strange perception of Santa, this movie is for us. It's dark, twisted and warped. I suggest this movie to anybody who likes that kind of movie.",Bad Santa

It will offend the PC crowd for sure but there are definitely good reasons for the movie to push the limits of bad taste as it fits the story and message perfectly. Also Billy Bob Thornton was born to play this role. All in all it's hilarious and always a breath of fresh air to play around Christmas time when you feel suffocated by all the other sappy feel-good Christmas flicks!,Bad Santa
70,blott2319-1,So hard to care about someone this awful,3,19 August 2020,"There's clearly an audience for movies about people who are despicable human beings that drive everyone around them crazy, particularly in the form of comedies. Ever since Bad Santa there has been a run on films that simply take a job title and slap ""Bad"" before it so they can tell the story of some person that doesn't adhere to civilized society's idea of what is decent. I was hoping there was something magical in Bad Santa that inspired this trend, but it was everything I expected. Billy Bob Thornton plays a character that is completely reprehensible in every sense of the word, and somehow as the movie progresses we're supposed to sympathize with him because he doesn't completely screw over a clueless young boy that admires him for no good reason. Or perhaps we're supposed to sympathize with him because some of the people around him are even worse. Either way Bad Santa asks us to laugh simply because this guy is bad, and I don't find that kind of non-joke to be funny in the slightest.The entire film takes place in some kind of fantasy world where this drunk would be allowed to interact with children for more than 5 minutes despite cursing like a sailor, and looking worse than a wino who's been living on the street for his entire life. The strange living situation of the child is also out of an Airplane-style spoof, and doesn't make sense in the real world. The concept of a mall Santa who roams from town to town every Christmas with his elf and pulls off one big robbery each year is intriguing, and would work if it weren't for the excessive layers of ""Bad"" that they have to pile on this Bad Santa in order to make the title work. The first conversation with John Ritter would have any sane person sending them on their way, and yet they get hired for the job and keep it. Not to mention the strange sexual proclivities of Lauren Graham's character that allow her to not only find this creep attractive, but actually want to engage in some sort of long-term relationship. None of this struck me as funny, instead it was all an odd amalgamation of nonsense characters that told a story about a guy I hated.",Bad Santa
71,sarastro7,A feel-good tale of misery,6,8 December 2004,"I was afraid that this movie might be really obnoxious, but Bad Santa is eminently watchable, and definitely held my attention. I'm not a big fan of foul language, but it wasn't out of place here. The movie ended up being a feel-good experience with plenty of laughs. I liked its use of classical music. Very atmospheric.I give it a 6 out of 10. It was pretty good, but other than making me smile, it didn't really achieve anything special. It was like a low-key holiday-comedy equivalent of your average big spiffy-looking summer action movie. Nicely entertaining, some fun moments, good one-liners, but not a heck of a lot more. It was OK.(Actually, I watched it because of the delectable Lauren Graham, but her role in it was fairly small. It's a good thing Billy Bob Thornton is no slouch in the acting area! That man can do just about anything!)",Bad Santa
72,mentalcritic,If only all Horrorday-season films could be like this...,10,2 December 2004,"If the insipid, family-friendly, Christians-über-alles propaganda that is unleashed every holiday season has you dreading the end of every year, do not despair. Relief is at hand, and it is a supreme irony that it should come from mainstream media sources that normally drown us in the garbage I just spoke of. Columbia Pictures woke up and realized that there are people who don't fit into the Nuclear Family, 2.3 children mold that MoneyMas is normally marketed to. That's what Bad Santa is all about.Our story focuses on a failure who fritters away his years by working stores as a Santa. As the film opens, we learn why he bothers with the Santa routine. His midget sidekick sneaks into the store he is casing, then disables the alarm, and together, the team loots the store for all they can get. Our main hero, however, wastes away everything he makes from this endeavor. As a result, he is there casing a store the next year, but things don't go quite as smoothly as he plans during the year depicted in this film.First, he meets a rather attractive bartender. Played by Lauren Graham of Whingemore Girls fame, her turn in this film could not be more far removed from what she is known for. It is almost as if she wanted to take a big dump on people's expectations of her. In this endeavor, Lauren's character is a foul-mouthed nymph with a Santa fetish. Speaking of foul-mouthed, it takes some real nerve to make a MoneyMas film that, at 243 profanities, sets the record for MoneyMas films. Before Bad Santa, I doubt there even was a record of this type for MoneyMas films.Two major names were signed onto this film, but had to drop out due to other commitments. These being Bill Murray and Jack Nicholson. It is just as well that they did, because the casting here is perfect. Who else but Billy Bob Thornton could deliver lines about what his female costars aren't going to do right for a week with such conviction? Billy Bob says that he was actually drunk during filming. Which adds a whole new dimension to the film - trying to determine which scenes were filmed drunk or sober.There are going to be people crying that this film is offensive, or not in the ""true spirit of MoneyMas"" (whatever that means). Quite honestly, with the saccharine feel of MoneyMas, we need *more* films like Bad Santa, not less. The holiday suicide rate would be reduced if people who saw this time for what it was, a time of worshiping the bigger wallet, had greater access to material like this.I gave Bad Santa a ten out of ten. There is no film on Earth that has been marketed to tie in with MoneyMas, not Santa With Muscles or even the Star Wars Holiday Special, that I have enjoyed this much. See it once, see it twice, see it as many times as you need to get through the so-called Holiday Season.",Bad Santa
73,Karl Self,"Bad Santa, So-so Film, Great Acting",5,23 June 2007,"This one is kinda tricky to review. On the one hand, it didn't make my list of ""definite must sees"", and it's not a movie I could heartily recommend to inquiring friends. Very much unlike Zwigoff's earlier documentary ""Crumb"", by the way, which I consider to be one of the best films I've ever feasted my eyes on. On the other hand, Bad Santa did have its moments, and mostly a lot of memorable acting (Santa, the kid, the Santa fetishist, and the mall manager -- rest in peace, John Ritter).A big problem with this movie is that it comes a few decades too late. Had it been made in the, say, 1950ies, when Christmas still meant something and society was, if anything, less jaded, it would have been absolutely sensational. Of course there would have been less cussing and references to plumper buggery (which actually would have added rather than detracted to its quality). But as it is, disparaging Christmas cheer after the millennium is a bit like informing a San Fernando valley queen of DVDA that babies don't come from cabbage patches.I come away thinking that Zwigoff is an OK director for feature films, but a genius for documentaries. Probably mostly because he's less about make-believe, and all about people. So, Terry, quit the day job and go make another documentary.",Bad Santa
74,CitizenCaine,Bad Santa Is Good,7,9 March 2004,"Up on the housetop click, click, click. Billy Bob plays Santa as sick, sick, sick. All for the good little girls and boys. Santa prefers beer and cursing to bringing toys. It came upon a midnight clear, a little black elf strolling through a mall with pointed ears. And so the story begins, as Billy Bob Thornton and Tony Cox star as a phony department store Santa/con-man and his once a year elf/sidekick.They play Santa and his elf as time clock jobs in order to get at what they're really interested in: robbing the mall! They meet an odd assortment of characters, really odd, along the way, including a dopey, loser, fat kid, who really has a serious Santa worship issue. Kudos to the fat kid for being absolutely perfect in this pivotal role. Cloris Leachman plays the fat kid's weirdo, near comatose grandmother, and she is very funny in her few scenes.Bernie Mac is on hand as an unconventional mall security chief, who knows a good thing when he sees it. John Ritter, in his last role, is a passive mall manager that doesn't know how to deal with Billy Bob's unique Santa. Lauren Graham, from the WB's Gilmore Girls, is anything but a hard working single parent here. From the opening bell, where Billy Bob has an accident in his Santa pants, we can see this is not going to be the usual holiday film. However, this does not mean there isn't good cheer. Thornton's bad Santa eventually meets Graham, and the fat kid clings to him like a dust bunny. Eventually bad Santa wants to do a good thing. Many reviewers panning the film focus on the swearing, namely the F-word, the alcoholic behavior, and seemingly mean-spirited Santa as being a blight in a holiday movie about Christmas.However, that's like complaining about the navel-bearing clothes of Christina Aguilera, and forgetting that she does have one of the best singing voices in today's pop music. The film is hilariously in bad taste, and is often screamingly funny. The two scenes that stand out are the cardboard reindeer scene, and the safe scene with The Anvil Chorus playing. At the same time, it pulls us in to Thornton's comedic redemption. It's a different kind of holiday movie. One that is certainly not politically correct, and one that skewers tradition as if it were a roasted pig. This is THE Christmas movie for those of us that tire of all the holiday hoopla every year, even before it starts. It is simultaneously bold, different, entertaining, and risky. Bad Santa is like a package waiting to be discovered, if only by open-minded non-traditionalists. *** of 4 stars.",Bad Santa
75,phubbs,Bad Santa,7,16 February 2014,"No this isn't a National Lampoon movie although you could easily be fooled into thinking that with this title. As you might have expected this is a Christmas set film and its about a naughty Santa character. Again you could easily be fooled into thinking this is a silly kids movie with lots of fart gags...but no, its actually a black comedy and most definitely for the grown ups.The whole point of this film is the ever so slight redemption of the main character played by Thornton. This guy is a low down permanently drunk criminal who drags his way through life whilst robbing department stores with his dwarf partner. The dubious duo take yearly jobs as a department store Santa and his elf worker, this way they get to know the ins and outs of the store so they can easily rob it. Things change for Thornton's character 'Stokes' when he meets a tubby little boy who he kinda befriends and takes a shine to...eventually.This film is kinda unique in the sense that the main character has many flaws and issues which you tend to think he will sort out at some point by the end of the film. The twist and funny part is he doesn't really change at all, he does a little bit with the help of his little fat young friend, but not too much really, he still ends up as the same bum. The amusing things about the film are the constant little moments where Thornton's character gets angry or frustrated with the fat kid and swears at him. The little fat kid (eerily played by Kelly) seems to be a bit slow and just takes the abuse, in one ear and out the other. At times it can be very funny to watch these outbursts yet at other times you do feel sorry for the kid or Stokes because you know he sometimes doesn't mean it.The heist aspect of the film is quite good and offers some reasonably tense moments, especially near the end. The various Santa sequences are probably the films highlights as we see Thornton getting sneezed and coughed on by lots of pant wetting tots. Of course his reactions and the way he treats the kids are the best bits, he basically sneers growls and scowls at them, finally nudging them off his knee and virtually kicking them to the curb. Watching the reactions of the parents is great, as a man pushing 40 and with no kids I love it, if I was a parent I might feel differently I guess who knows.The darkest sequence must be when a severely sozzled Stokes crawls up the escalator towards his Santa grotto. His beard and clothes now filthy stained and damaged, he looks like crap, can hardly walk and promptly falls into a reindeer display. This whole sequence starts out funny but descends into a more cringeworthy incident as he freaks out and starts to smash up the Xmas display in front of everyone in the store, its still amusing but also poignant and depressing...much like the plot as a whole really.The finale was a tad of a let down for me, it does seem like you're gonna get the predictable ending where Stokes will die trying to achieve a small slice of decency in his life, the right ending. A bit like the finale in 'The Wrestler' where Rourke's character goes out doing what he loves but also reclaiming a small part of his dignity right at the end. Even though this ending is predictable as I said, I think it would have been stronger for obvious reasons. Instead Stokes lives on and we get some mumbo jumbo about how he survived and what he plans to do after he heals up. This simply feels like an open ending so they can roll out a sequel which this film really doesn't need in my opinion, if it happens that is. I think it should have wrapped up there and then.All in all I like how this is basically an anti-Christmas flick which sticks two fingers up at the sweet yuletide greetings side of it and embraces the Scrooge side with extreme profanity. Its not exactly original in idea, the drunk rude Santa schtick has been done before but you can't deny its amusing. Crude rude edgy and drenched in cynicism...but there is a soft warm heart buried deep in there and it just about manages to shine through in the end.7/10",Bad Santa
76,tim-764-291856,Naughty Santa!!,8,8 May 2012,"When I recently wrote a review for Cameron Diaz's 'Bad Teacher', I made reference to - and comparisons with - this, Billy Bob Thornton's Bad Santa.Both are deliciously crass and deliciously dire human beings and as such, we can revel in their animosity and loathing for all things decent and their twisted antics fuel a gross and profane humour, that I find are both a real tonic and irresistible.Many won't - and indeed, don't but that's personal choice for you. Bad Santa is as an antidote as you'll ever get to syrupy, cloying and very annoying precocious normal Christmas 'family' movies. Willie T Stokes (Thornton) always says what we'd love to as brat after brat line up with their overbearing parents, but wouldn't dare, of course, cos we'd be arrested, or at least barred for life from the shopping centre!His alcoholic antics are surprisingly realistic and that means they're both gross and funny, often at the same time. Thornton easily turns from condescending snarl to deadpan jet-black humour with skill and at a turn of a hat. He's also a randy old son of a and is always eyeing up what he shouldn't and quite often can be found in cahoots with his black dwarf assistant Marcus (Tony Fox) staying on after department stores close and liberally helping themselves to the merchandise. Bernie Mac also features in one of his last films.Meanwhile a wonderfully ever-questioning chubby young boy befriends Willie and takes him to stay with him and Grandma. Willie's reaction to the advent calendar that the kid opens to him is beautifully first class non-reactionary, whilst barmaid Lauren Colman who has a fetish for Santas gives this Santa some good old rumpy pumpy action.Like Bad Teacher, Bad Santa is best served post-pub, late evening and with some mates around. Take it for what it is - a cleverly and vibrantly scripted wicked adult comedy and not for what it isn't and what it doesn't try to be.",Bad Santa

It's very unlikely that you will want to sit down with the kids and watch this during the holiday season, or any other season for that matter, as it will certainly produce many awkward moments. It is one of the funniest, crudest, and most inappropriate movies I have ever seen. There is so much politically incorrect and just plain wrong behavior in this movie that it's hard to stop laughing. This movie is definitely not for prudes or anyone who is the least bit uptight or anyone heavily invested in upholding society's mores (like maybe some of your aunts), but, for everyone else, this film is so twisted, it's brilliant.",Bad Santa
78,tbills2,B X d S X nt X,8,16 May 2013,"It's offensive, repulsive and foul-mouthed. It's rude. It's lewd. It's entirely filthy. It's constantly depressing. It's completely irresistible, outrageously funny, and it's inherently decent. It's holiday fun for everyone, except for kids. Rated R for vulgar language and gross humor, this is an adult's comedy. At its heart, Bad Santa displays the bonding relationship between Willie and The Kid. Willie is a miserable alcoholic sleazebag crook who makes his due by pulling apparently clever department store heists each X-mas while posing as a mall santa. The Kid is bright, inexperienced, and irritating and in assured need of a father figure. These two have a lot to offer each other. Billy Bob Thornton plays a very bad santa, and gives one of the top performances seen from a comedy. Bad Santa is Thornton's movie. Bernie Mac and John Ritter do their best to try and steal the show. Mac is deplorable, and Ritter is adorable. I cannot stress enough John Ritter's pleasant performance. This was his best role, and he was on the verge of soaring into a greater stardom. The same could be said for Bernie Mac. God rest their souls in loving memory. Tony Cox has a number of enjoyable roles, though he is at his best here as Marcus, Willie's loathsome partner in crime. Brett Kelly is fine and perfect as The Kid. Lauren Graham fits this movie well, but is relatively out of her league.

This is a finely tuned redemption story, that just so happens to pitch directly to where I'm coming from. Chiming in with so many other commenters, it's true: You can watch Billy Bob's heart begin to melt as the story winds up, and this builds to a masterful climax.That's enough. This one's a gem. Yeah, it's dark, but that makes the hero's modest achievement one of the greatest miracles of the holiday season. Watch this; and you might want to bring a clean hanky.UPDATE re: Director's cutI recommend the director's cut. It's simple: If you enjoyed Bad Santa purely for its ""bad boy"" elan, then stick with Badder Santa. If you found yourself being touched by the redemption angle in the storyline, then the Director's Cut is a safe bet. Zwigoff cuts out the superfluous wood, and leaves a finely tuned product; better suited to those who expect a little more artistry from their movies.",Bad Santa
80,Rogue-32,Thurman Merman?!?!,10,4 December 2003,"Tired of all those jaded, faded tv Christmas specials, all those cut-from-the-same-lame-mold Christmas movies, fellow seeker?   Well, look ye no further, for you have found the film that is the virtual pure embodiment of the ultimate Christmas spirit - Bad Santa. Poor Willie (a brilliant Billy Bob Thornton, at the top of his game, a la Sling Blade) is at the end of his sordid, twisted and drunken rope, barely able to cope with his once-a-year Christmas gig as S Claus.  Enter salvation, in the form of overweight, parentless 12-year-old Thurman Merman, who instantly becomes fixated on the wasted Willie and, in the course of the film, teaches him the True Meaning of Christmas.Of course, there's a lot of bad road that Willie must travel to reach redemption (in the form of what he refers to as the 3 Bs: Booze, Bull**** and. . .well, can't mention the third one here, folks, just use your vivid imaginations - hint: it has 3 syllables).  But reach it he does, and you will not be sorry you have made this most poignant of journeys with him. *wiping away a tear.*",Bad Santa
81,TheNorthernMonkee,anti-Santa's greatest gift? At times yeah,7,5 November 2004,"SPOILERSEvery year, Christmas arrives and despite the whole spirit of good will to all men, a lot of people get REALLY angry at the whole occasion. Christmas is a Commercial, over-rated time where we are all encouraged to be good to each other and to see our families.Christmas films normally follow the similar sort of trend to the festival itself. In 2003's ""Elf"" we had Will Ferrell teaching people to love each other and to embrace the spirit of Christmas. Thankfully, counteracting this, we have the bad tempered feelings of ""Bad Santa"".Willie (Billy Bob Thornton) and Marcus (Tony Cox) are two robbers who team up every year at Christmas to rob department stores. Dressing as Santa and an elf, the two stumble around making money breaking into safes on Christmas Eve, normally with Willie being drunk at the time. With Willie constantly miserable however, events begin to get complicated, especially with the involvement of a strange little fat kid (Brett Kelly).As the depressed Santa stuck in a rut, Billy Bob Thornton has created another superb character. In a role which could have ended up with Bill Murray or Jack Nicholson, Thornton has made this vomiting, anal sex obsessed, Santa his own. At the same time, Tony Cox, Brett Kelly and Lauren Graham (as Sue, Thornton's lover) all put in quality performances.Directed by Terry ""Ghostworld"" Zwigoff, this film is well made in design and style. Sadly however, the script is inconsistent and doesn't always click. Written by Ficarra and Requa, the writers of ""Cats and Dogs"", the plot trundles along and makes us laugh a lot at times. With jokes involving anal sex, kicking people in the groin and a LOT of alcohol, the story is never anything but low brow. This is in itself a problem. Whilst laughing at someone kicking someone else somewhere sensitive, the idea can definitely get repetitive and gets tiresome after a while.All in all, ""Bad Santa"" is a wonderful idea. By getting a drunk with a filthy mouth to dress up as Santa (Thornton even admitting to being drunk during filming), Christmas takes on a whole meaning. Sadly however, at just over an hour and a half long, the story does drag at times and can't keep the humour going throughout. The film is well worth a watch, but it seems unlikely that we'll be remembering it within five years time.",Bad Santa
82,jpschapira,"""A classic"" (a friend of mine said, and he hadn't even seen it)",9,31 July 2005,"For a lot of reasons, ""Bad Santa"" finds itself near excellence during its running time. It's not difficult to explain how a movie becomes great, I always explain that when I watch a drama, thriller...But comedy? A great comedy? It could be ""Bad Santa"". I haven't laughed so hard with movie situations since ""Liar Liar"". This movie has a way of creating laughable experiences no comedy uses these days. I'll go on to that later.Terry Zwigoff has directed some movies; a few. But there aren't any movies, he directed recognized movies so he was recognized. He took long enough periods between each film, but some may say it was worth to wait. Sometimes writer, sometimes director, Zwigoff places his characters in their stories and begins to direct. It's not visually outstanding or beautiful; but I just can say that it looks like everybody is listening to him and doing what he says. At times he creates some long distance shots, as if he was a mere observer, just passing by.And Billy Bob Thornton's story...I was recently thinking he is one of the most important people in Hollywood, and the story is quite interesting; it began with a film called ""Sling Blade"". Thornton wrote the screenplay and acted in the movie. I heard he turned out to be outstanding at both jobs, so he wasn't just in for the writing, he was in for the acting too. He proved to me he could act, brilliantly, in ""The Man Who Wasn't There"". He proved to me he could write, with his script of ""The Gift"". Then he is no fool.His character in the movie, however, is a fool. A fool, a drunk, a sex fan ad ultimately a thief that works as Santa in malls just to rob them with a partner, Marcus (Tony Cox), who is the elf. Plus, Marcus is a midget and they can both be sure they'll never be fired. They are, alongside The Kid (Brett Kelly), the most important players in the film and they both swear a lot in some situations that give magic to the film and I won't reveal. When has saying bad words been magical? I'm coming to that, but just needed to say how Thornton finds the note here. How he shines throughout the ride, stealing the show with his lines, with his faces. Those faces that are not Bill Murray's faces in ""Lost in translation"", neither Jack Nicholson's known faces. With his study of the character he invented his own faces. His movements also; it is everything. He's sitting in that Santa chair and when a kid comes and asks for a present he doesn't know, says: ""What the f**k is that?"". He doesn't care, and that's great. It is also great to wonder how serious the man can be with his work. I'd heard he had stopped smoking, and in the movie I see him always with a cigarette in his hands that I wonder if he wasn't smoking all the time. Same thing with the drinks...Probably he walked drunk in the set. After earning money from a robbery, his character says he'll go to Miami and manage a bar, when his partner believes he'll be drinking to death and come back as soon as he is called. Then a camera shows him in the middle of a bar, as if he was running it, but as we get closer we realize he's not.Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, the writers of ""Cats & Dogs"", must be two intelligent men. After a movie like the one they wrote before, you wouldn't expect something like ""Bad Santa"" out of their hands, but they created those magical bad words. Because, as I wanted to say all along, the script is so loyal to the reality of its characters that laughs come easily. Not like in other comedies, where they have to used forced elements to make us laugh; disgusting excrement, bathroom scenes, stupid swearing...It's not good. Here, the loyalty Ficarra and Requa generate with their characters, with their main character, almost makes this comedy look like a character study; like a drama or a character piece, although it is just another comedy.",Bad Santa

No, I'm sure this movie is super funny and totally raunchy and makes good use of the word ""bad"" and all the possible meanings that word has, the problem's probably on my end, like I didn't watch the movie right or I wasn't paying attention whenever the funny stuff happened.

85,JohnRayPeterson,"Lewd, crude and in time for Christmas",10,18 September 2011,"Get your hand on this movie before Xmas because it's much in demand by the time that week comes around. Watch it by yourself or with someone very close, otherwise be prepared to be embarrassed, laughing uncontrollably in all the right places, meaning it's a dead giveaway as to how much of a pervert one is. The general consensus in the ratings and reviews bare my assessment that you will laugh uncontrollably; you've been forewarned.Let me provide you with arguments for my highest recommendations for this film, in the form of some descriptions of the characters. Your main thespian, Billy Bob Thorton, plays the role of Willie (Oh what a perfectly well chosen surname!), your everyday despicable sociopath drunk whose lack of will to live, other than for whatever is the immediate gratification available, plays opposite Tony Cox, in the role of Marcus (similarly well chosen surname) who must aggressively motivate Willie, once a year, and has for many years, to pull a Christmas heist at some chosen big department store, providing them a score big enough to meet their financial needs for the remainder of the year; that task of motivating Willie annually has become a chore, as we quickly come to realize. In real life, Tony Cox, a 'little person' to be politically correct, has stated this role of Marcus to be the role of a lifetime for him, a dream come true. Both men are as fowl mouth as it comes, considering their cover as Santa and his little helper.Lauren Graham in the role of Sue, Willie's lust interest for this season is a good looking horny barmaid who crushes on Santas and particularly on Willie; okay it's more a fetish than a crush. Bernie Mac, plays Gin (another superbly well thought of name), the department store head of security, and as crooked as lobbyist with a gambling addiction, is charged by the department store manager Bob Chipeska, played by the late John Ritter, in the role of a prude and very wimpy sap, to find a way to fire the seasonal part-timers. The scheming duo's behaviour, whose dismissal is justified because Willie is either incoherently drunk or banging any fat woman consenting to it in the women's clothing department change-rooms, is an opportunity for Gin to extort a hefty percentage from the thieves; Gin provides the unwilling partners with his support, in the form of corroboration, when they threaten Chipeska with legal action on the basis of discrimination against 'little people'.Brett Kelly, plays a self-sufficient yet clueless socially retarded child who believes Willie is the real Santa, and invites him to stay at his home; 'the kid' (no name) lives with his mostly unconscient grandmother, played veteran actor Cloris Leachman, as his father is in jail for fraud and his mother is not in the picture. Willie squats in the luxurious home, without shame and despite the objections of Marcus who feels this jeopardises their plans. The kid is void of any expression of emotion and oblivious to Willie's debauchery in the backyard Jacuzzi; however, he does pester Santa to no end and to the point where Willie feels compelled to rescue 'the kid' from bullies. The movie has even more to offer in the way of a story. This is a first class comedy better enjoyed in the uncensored version and no other Santa movie comes close to matching it.",Bad Santa
86,tomimt,Well written comedy with laughs,9,18 December 2006,"Willie (Billy-Bob Thorton) is an alcoholic dead beat, who, dressed as Santa and an elf, robs department stores with his pal Marcus (Tony Cox). Willie's life is in a stand still, only thing he does is self destruct. And of course when he goes on a new job with Marcus he begins to change because of an unexpected event.Sounds standard case for a bad comedy, doesn't it. But That isn't the case. The whole film is filled with weird characters and situations. The jokes are funny and most of them work without any hint of forcing. Almost all ""in your face"" type of skits are missing from the film and that is pretty refreshing.The role of Willie looks like it's tailor made for Thorton. It seems, that all the antics of the character flow from the backbone of the actor. It's very easy to believe in him.If you are looking for a cure for the nausea caused by all the other Christmas movies, 'Bad Santa' is it. It's very well made comedy, which manages to hide the pretty standard story inside of the great acting and well written script.",Bad Santa

89,gigan-92,"""You got some lip midget!""",10,17 March 2012,"Single handedly one of the most cynical comedies ever, and yet still one of the most hilarious. Probably the greatest aspect of this movie is how original the plot is, and how the writing does not hold back at all. It spares no profanity, and it makes no real attempt to make its protagonist anything more than an asshole. Who better to play such a character than Billy Bob Thorton? The beautiful thing is while no doubt he's no doubt a hedonistic drunkard, by the end of the story you'll end up feeling quite a bit of sympathy for him.The supporting cast is just great, with Tony Cox and the awesome Bernie Mac (R.I.P.) giving us plenty of laughs. Brett Kelly is kind of like the gum at the bottom of your show at first, but you end up embracing him as well. It's really quite miraculous, because when you first see him, hear his obnoxious little voice, I thought there was no way I was gonna like this kid, but somehow I did. And believe it or not it was actually co-written and produced by the Coen Brothers, what a surprise yah?

I'm one of them and I don't like ""Miracle on 34th Street"" either.""Bad Santa"" is destined to be a seasonal classic for me.  Billy Bob Thornton is deliciously mean-spirited as a drunken, foul-mouthed lout whose only real skill is safe-cracking.  Each Christmas he works as a department store Santa with his dwarf sidekick so that they can make a one-shot killing that will let them veg out until the next season beckons.Desecrating the traditional schmaltzy Christmas film genre, Billy Bob befriends a tubby, snot-running-down-his-face little boy who believes in Santa and eventually warms up to the kid, teaching him some important life lessons (thankfully not including blowing a safe).A neat reversal of the traditional Yule tale, Billy Bob is the all-time perfect sleaze Santa of the cinema.  If I laughed any harder I would have been on the theater floor.I can't wait for the DVD to come out.

91,movieguy1021,Bad Santa: 6/10,6,30 November 2003,"As foul-mouthed and dirty as it is, Bad Santa is one of the most surprising and desperately needed movies this year. Not everyone gets in the holiday cheer, as Hollywood would want us to think, and Bad Santa illustrates that perfectly as the first scene has Willie (Billy Bob Thornton) in a Santa outfit, getting drunk in a bar. Soon afterwards, he's outside vomiting. Not exactly the ho-ho-ho St. Nick we all know and love.Willie and his elfish friend Marcus (Tony Cox) move around to another mall in another city each Christmas with the intentions of robbing the mall Christmas Eve. They've done this for eight years, but this year Willie has gotten drunker and drunker, spewing out insults to all of the kids who just want a sit on Santa's lap. However, everything changes when he meets Sherman (Brett Kelly), a lonely, naïve kid. Willie's in trouble with the law, so he shacks up with Sherman for a while, and starts to realize the true meaning of Christmas (what else?).Bad Santa is a dark, hateful comedy. There's nothing light and cheery about it, for the most part. If seeing Billy Bob insult anyone who comes into his way makes you laugh, then Bad Santa was made just for you. To me, I found that it had its moments, but there wasn't anything that hilarious in it. Some of the insults were funny, some weren't. It was pretty much hit-and-miss. The funniest part of the entire movie was during the opening scene, which I have already described, a woman sitting behind me said, `I know THAT feeling.'I do appreciate, however, the courage that everyone, especially director Terry Zwigoff, had to make such a daring picture. This is not a normal movie, and everyone involved knew it, so I think that in itself deserves applause.Thornton seemed to know too well how to be an unlikable drunkard, but I think he was great in Bad Santa simply because he took a character that no one in their right mind would like to be next to and by the end turn him into an all-around nice guy. Cox was great, too, but his so-called `plot twist' at the end disappointed me. Speaking of disappointment, many people who were in this movie were wasted, specifically Lauren Graham, Lauren Tom, Bernie Mac, John Ritter, Ajay Naidu, Alex Borstein, and Cloris Leachman. They all had very small roles, and more could have been done with them.I could see some people not liking the ending, for it's the typical gooey Hollywood ending, but I felt it worked well and not tacked on, as many endings like that are. I liked how it didn't really explain everything and didn't wrap the ending up in a nice little package with a bow and express ship it to our hearts. It was somewhat open-ended and closed on a completely different note than the opening began with, and change is what the movie's all about.Bad Santa is a refreshing and sometimes funny comedy that most people probably won't like because it's crude and profane. However, if you can put up with that, you'll find lots to like.My rating: 6/10Rated R for pervasive language, strong sexual content and some violence.",Bad Santa

The kids will find the movie unsuitable. It's better to see the movie first before you decide to show it to the kids. I wouldn't. I did like the name of the movie ""Bad Santa"" considering we all see Santa as a good fatherly figure, and this movie believe it or not actually lives up to its name. You get to see Santa's bad or ugly side, and this movie depicts it very well indeed. Willie is the main character. He's Santa Claus. Willie is someone you won't like. He's an alcoholic. Willie has an assistant or friend named Marcus who happens to be an Elf. Yes, Marcus is a man with a short stature. Their job is to rob department stores on Christmas Eve.

For some reason the release of this film was postponed to the Christmas of 2004 where i live so i had heard quite a lot of buzz about it almost a whole year before.Willie is a miserable and drunk Santa Claus. He works in shopping malls every Christmas even though he hates children. What drives him though is not the Christmas spirit, rather the robberies that he and his elf henchman perform every Christmas. Every year a new town, every year a new robbery. And this year is no different, even though things are going to change before the end...Billy Bob Thornton is in my opinion the main reason why this movie works at all. He is perfect as the sour, heavily drinking and swearing Santa Claus. And i don't know when i last saw a movie where there was so much cursing going on towards children. And this is maybe also the problem this movie faces. How do you find the right level? How far do you take it before it's not even funny any more, just insulting. I feel that most of the time this movie hits the spot and manages to stay on the right side of that border. But of course there are occasions where the character Willie just becomes obnoxious.Maybe what i appreciate most is the deviation from the usual Christmas movie that ""Bad Santa"" provides. It's actually a movie released at Christmas, featuring someone who hates Christmas, that doesn't end in an overly cute way. Rather the ending fits the movie quite well without becoming sugar-sweet.I rate this 6/10.",Bad Santa

There are also quite a few laugh-out-loud moments.  The funniest scene has Willie getting drunk and tearing up the Kid's advent calendar, to a drunken brass rendition of ""Silent Night.""

Then, it picks up.This is a cold, verbally and sexually explicit dark comedy that is probably a little bit too cynical in tone, but that holds itself up just about well enough all in all.There's certainly a sense of lingering and repetition, with the constant redundant swearing, scenes that are practically built off facile swearing dialog lines, but if one persists enough there's a pretty fun plot at the center of it, a sort of anti-Christmas Christmas magic about it with the kid and the relationship he builds with 'Santa', pretty funny secondary characters like the late Ritter (major stuckup), the late Bernie Mac or Naidu's hilariously random and unnecessary cameo scene.There's even something of a moral at the end.

The buzz was it could be unpleasantly crude. I'm glad I decided to see it and thoroughly enjoyed the movie in spite of myself! The film actually starts off with strains of Tchaikovsky's ""Sleeping Beauty, Ballet Suite, Op. 66"" and it sets one in a pleasant mood. Ha! Billy Bob Thornton is truly fantastic -- he completely inhabits the role of the ever drunken Santa, a safe cracking one at that. I conditioned my ears to simply 'glide' over any cursed words, taking them as punctuating pauses, and focused on the story proper and performances of the characters. Tony Cox is just the right dose of a sidekick to Thornton as his crony that controls all the likely fiscal endeavors. Brett Kelly as the Kid who is oblivious to the obvious drunkenness of Santa Thornton. He single-mindedly insists on 'seeing' and treating Thornton's Santa as Santa himself. And yes, there is heart to the whole plot, sprinkled with believable surprises and dashes of Hollywood action sequence. Lauren Graham as Sue who can't help falling in love with Santa, and an angel to The Kid and grandma (Cloris Leachman); brief supporting essentials with Bernie Mac as store security and John Ritter as store manager. It is a Christmas story and there are plenty of songs and tunes included in keeping with the spirited season: Andy Williams singing ""It's the most wonderful time of the year,"" Dean Martin's ""Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow"" to name a couple. There's even ""Papa loves mambo"" by Xavier Cugat to liven up some more. Kudos to director Zwigoff who deftly delivered a movie, though may not be for everyone (NFE) -- scripted by John Requa and Glenn Ficarra -- has a runtime of 93 minutes which is just the right length for a fun and entertaining time. And how can anything be vulgar with classical music a-playing -- besides Tchaikovsky, there's also Chopin, Rossini, Verdi, and Shostakovich's ""Waltz No. 2 from Jazz Suite No. 2"" (notably used by Kubrick in ""Eyes Wide Shut"" 1999).

The Coen brothers gave us ""Intolerable Cruelty"" 2003, another fun stab at the predicament of a successful lawyer played with aplomb by George Clooney, impeccable equal tempo by Catherine Zeta-Jones, and brief but always outstanding appearance from Geoffrey Rush, who opened the movie singing the S&G song ""The Boxer."" Also produced by KL Line (seems like Coen brothers related) which has three films to date: The Man Who Wasn't There 2001, Intolerable Cruelty 2003, and Bad Santa 2003.Coen brothers' films always come with that touch of aplomb without fail -- cool assurance, poised self-confidence we readily feel in ""Raising Arizona"" 1987; ""Fargo"" 1996; ""O Brother Where Art Thou"" 2000; and ""The Big Lebowski"" 1998.

This film is actualy fairly entertaining if you can get past all the foul language and bad behavior to see a pretty solid acting job from Billy Bob that carries the movie. GRADE: B+",Bad Santa
100,abcvision,ho ho ho,8,19 December 2014,"Trying to get into the ba humbug spirit of things for the holiday season is not easy with all the cheer. But Bad Santa comes close. In it Willie who portrays a mall Santa with side kick elf Marcus is everything you expect a Santa not to be. He is crude, cynical, drunk most of the time, and a skirt chasing pervert. Along the way he befriends a kid and discovers a whole new purpose in spreading Christmas cheer. Really nice to see John Ritter and Berne Mac on the big screen and their humor. Not a movie for all but a fun story of the dark side of Christmas. It is perfect modern classic and tale of the unexpected.",Bad Santa
101,AKS-6,Hilarious,8,26 March 2005,"Bad Santa is everything I wished it to be when I rented it: funny, funny and funny. In fact, I thought this movie was hilarious. However, what surprised me, and made me like the movie even more, is the fact that it is not only a foul-mouthed comedy, it is also very touching and sweet.Billy Bob Thornton is brilliant as the foul-mouthed mall Santa who hates the kids that sit on his lap. I even liked Lauren Graham in this movie (I don't particularly like her in Gilmore Girls). Also, the young boy who plays the rather slow Merman kid is also great.So, Bad Santa is a hilarious movie with some sweet elements and great performances from the cast... Can't give it less than an 8 out of 10.",Bad Santa
102,bbewnylorac,The antidote to schmaltzy Christmas movies,9,18 November 2015,"This movie is a breath of fresh air in so many ways. It's hilarious. On the surface, it's off-putting. Just for starters, there's the profanity, and the dedicated immorality of Billy Bob Thornton's mall Santa character, Willie, and everyone around him. In a way Willie is like a particularly evil version of Bill Murray's grumpy curmudgeon character in Groundhog Day. But Bad Santa has so much the ring of truth to it. When Willie -- a thief, alcoholic and conman -- is forced to look after a determinedly sweet little boy, he discovers he does have a heart somewhere in there and he might just be a rough diamond. The little boy is just the best actor. In fact, you will rarely see a better performance from a child. Some of it is the script, but also the boy plays it so naturally deadpan that most of his lines are hilarious. Good on the directors for going with someone unconventional and not just the cookie-cutter cute kid. The caustic, crude, very un-jolly Billy Bob Thornton is born to play the role of Bad Santa. The movie won't be to everyone's taste, but those with any sense of subtlety and a wicked sense of humour will find it a joy.",Bad Santa
103,ethanbresnett,A complete and utter waste of time...,4,11 December 2020,"This film was such a disappointment, and wasted so much potential.I liked the idea of the premise, but felt that they went down completely the wrong route with it and executed it so badly. The plot just didn't really seem to go anywhere, and did absolutely nothing for me. It felt very repetitive, rehashing the same jokes and ideas from start to finish.Speaking of the jokes, I didn't laugh once. I don't even recall cracking a smile. In truth I'm not even sure you could call them jokes. The script was essentially just Billy Bob Thornton swearing for an hour and a half. That may have passed as humour in 2003 but not these days. If this film was ever good, it certainly hasn't aged well. There was no intelligence or creativity in the screenplay at all. It felt like it was just lowest common denominator and as a result was pretty cringe at times.The one and only saving grace was the performance of Billy Bob Thornton. He was the light in this dark tunnel, and performed the role excellently. Unfortunately though, the character was awful. All of the characters were. There was no one in this room to route for, no one to like. I couldn't have cared less about any of them.I would highly encourage people to stay away from this film. This film neither delivers as a comedy or a Christmas film, so give it a miss for sure.",Bad Santa

Billy Bob Thornton plays Willie, a professional thief that uses a job posing as Santa to rob malls, along with his Marcus, a little person that plays the elf and brains of the group. Willie is a hard core alcoholic and is seen pissing himself more often than not. This is not a feel good kind of movie, though there are some touching moments between Willie and a kid that he sort of unofficially adopts for sake of a place to stay.
As I said earlier though, there is a shadow of sadness over this movie as it does touch on the reality of life around the holidays and how difficult it is for some people to cope. This is a good movie that is a yearly holiday watch for me.",Bad Santa

106,Flagrant-Baronessa,Coenesque 'blacker-than-black' comedy,7,15 October 2006,"Every year we are showered with an overdose of goody-goody saccharine Christmas tales with family morals, holiday miracles and heartfelt messages. Coenesque dark comedy Bad Santa bluntly distinguishes itself from these hackneyed templates by being blacker than the night and funnier than the bulk of all Christmas comedies (but a polite nod to Home Alone).'Bad Santa' is the story of two conmen who go on a road trip to malls dressed as Santa and his elf. Rather than spreading good cheer, the duo's motive is to rob each establishment, a strategy that becomes complicated when they encounter an 8-year-old who teaches them the true meaning of Christmas. Billy Bob Thornton is at his best and most hilarious as a booze-drenched, bitter, cursing, fu cking, shitting and perverted middle-aged nobody with an unapologetic lust for teenage girls and alcohol  the aforementioned providing for a great deal of laughs in the film. He is The Dude and Julian Noble (of The Matador) all rolled into one  a Santa so fundamentally 'wrong' that he becomes so right.In fact, the first scene of the film opens on a blunt, bitter and raw note that sets the hilarious tone for what is to come; a tired, cynical and drunken Thornton sits alone in a bar telling us what a loser he is and how he should have killed himself long ago. He then stumbles into an alleyway and vomits in a trashcan. Brilliant. Honest. It came as no surprise for me to learn that Thornton was in fact genuinely intoxicated for large parts of the shooting and sure enough, it invests 'Bad Santa' in that extra bad attitude quality.Yet for all its Coenesque humour (the brothers are executive producers for the film), it does not quite reach the sheer level of absurdity that The Big Lebowski can boast of. The little kid is primarily annoying and disgusting and although he arguably makes the story, his character often feels redundant. Ultimately, it also lacks quite a bit of direction and focus. If anything that is its fatal flaw but 'Bad Santa' undoubtedly remains afloat in spite of it. And hilariously so.7 out of 10",Bad Santa
107,majikstl,Ho-Ho-Horrible ...,1,29 March 2005,"The things that are wrong with this stupefyingly awful and utterly vile pseudo-Christmas saga are so plentiful and obvious that to list them all would become simply tiresome. It is easier just to say that there is absolutely nothing right with it. But, it is worth pinpointing at least one aspect of this mess that goes to the heart of the matter. The film is about a third-rate scumbag thief who is ""redeemed"" (yeah, right) by his affection for a child. The child in question is named Thurman Merman (ha-ha), who is short, fat and stupid. The poor kid exists in this film only because he is short, fat and stupid, because the callous hateful, pathetic excuse for a screenplay by Glen Ficarra and John Requa thinks it is hilarious to make fun of a child who is short, fat and stupid and to show others making fun of the child because he is short, fat and stupid. The film offers up several tsk-tsk moments that show it is not nice to make fun of a kid just because he is short, fat and stupid, but not until director Terry Zwigoff has served up a not-so-healthy helping of short, fat and stupid jokes. They get to have their short, fat and stupid cake and eat it too. As played by Brett Kelly, Thurman also has a certain sweet innocence about him. You care about him and not just because the poor young actor playing the part has been set up for humiliation by the abusively mean-spirited filmmakers to be the butt of their short, fat and stupid jokes. However, the film makes it clear by the end that this sweet innocence can be cured and the heartwarming moral of this third-rate scumbag film is that it is okay to be short, fat and stupid if you have the potential of also becoming a third-rate scumbag jerk -- like the thief and the makers of this stupefyingly awful film. The mind-boggling thing about this cheesy piece of dreck is that -- not only does it exist in the first place -- but that it was overwhelmingly embraced by a majority of critics who thought the cruel spiritual sadism that saturates it was funny. And more than that, they applauded it because of it's willingness to go to the extreme to trash everything and be as unredeemably offensive as possible. As if such goals were noble. It is like saying ""Yes, he is a child abuser, but golly gee, he abuses children so well that he deserves a round of applause!"" To aim for the gutter and fall face first into the gutter is not an achievement. Hasn't years of soul-sucking garbage by the likes of Adam Sandler, Tom Greene, the Ferrelly brothers and the Wayans brothers taught us anything? Tastelessness for tastelessness sake means nothing. Unlike, say Mel Brook's ""Springtime for Hitler"" number from THE PRODUCERS, a classic bit that worked on so many brilliant levels, the bad taste spewed forth by works like BAD SANTA doesn't elevate either the art or the viewer. It is a film with nothing to say. It only illustrates the contemptuous depths that filmmakers -- and unfortunately, critics -- will plunge to in order to show they are cutting edge or outrageous or bold. Yet, BAD SANTA proves to be none of those things; just the pathetic work of a sad little bully. Setting aside BAD SANTA's dubious aim to offend it's viewers; overlooking its casual contempt for childlike innocence and the simple pleasures of the Christmas season; showing a momentary indifference to the way it churns out obscenities like snowflakes in a midwinter blizzard, the film still remains awesomely incompetent. This is just simply a badly made film on every conceivable level.The story, being neither short nor fat, is nonetheless mind numbingly stupid. Billy Bob Thornton plays the scumbag thief who every year works as a shopping mall Santa so that he can rob the safe of one of the department stores. The flimsy thread of humor hangs on the idea that even though he is repeatedly falling down drunk while on duty; shouts obscenities and abuse at the children and their parents; and even is caught having sex in a dressing cubical with a prostitute, for reasons that defy logic, he can't be fired. Fired? Heck, he should be arrested. No, he should be committed. But then the feeble plot would collapse. Even the most illogical, scatterbrained farce at least makes an attempt to create some sort of rickety skeleton on which the illusion of logic can be built. BAD SANTA is too lazy to bother. But then, the plot isn't the important thing in this film: the main purpose here is to show endless scenes of Thornton in his filthy, sagging Santa suit behaving like a drunken, psychotic mental patient. BAD SANTA is a pitiful one-joke film which desperately milks its one pitiful joke endlessly, even though that one pitiful joke isn't funny in the first place. There will be those that will argue that you shouldn't make too much of the fact that BAD SANTA targets children and Christmas for its abuse, because, after all, it is not a kids' film; it is made for adults. And by that token, drug pushers should be allowed into the playground, put only during nap time. Films like BAD SANTA (and DEATH TO SMOOCHY and BIG DADDY and SOUTH PARK and TEAM AMERlCA among others) pollute the waters; they represent an ooze of contamination that is slowly eating away the whole concept of childhood. They vandalize adult memories of childhood, while leaving behind for the children nothing but a pile of broken toys beneath the Christmas tree. But it is done with no sense of irony or remorse; just the dubious joy of being bad for badness sake. I guess some things are sacred, or should be.",Bad Santa

It's also probably Billy Bob Thornton's best role since ""Sling Blade"". I can't think of many actors who could play such a crude, sexist, self-pitying lowlife scum... and still make him sympathetic! Billy Bob and his trusty elf-sized pal (the very funny Tony Cox) are professional thieves who make one big score every Christmas... getting jobs as a Santa and an elf in a major department store... and then sneaking in after hours to crack the safe. Trouble is, Billy Bob hates himself and his work more and more every year... drinking more and more to compensate. It also doesn't help that he seems to hate children. Eventually one weird little boy takes a shine to this lewd, crude Santa... using him as a surrogate dad (despite the non-stop abuse that Billy Bob heaps on him). Lauren Graham (of TV's Gilmore girls) also takes a liking to Billy Bob... but that's because she has had a weird sexual Santa fetish ever since she was a little girl... which Billy Bob is only too happy to indulge. Bernie Mac also has some good scenes as a store detective who uncovers the scam. John Ritter's last movie role is kind of a nothing part... but he probably gets more mileage out of it than anybody else would.Extremely crude humor will not be for everybody... but Billy Bob's delivery of his lines is just about perfect. More than just funny, he also delivers a great performance of a self-loathing man who is at his lowest... with nowhere else to go but up. A pity that the movie wimps out a little at the very end... but, hey, it can't erase what went on before. ""This is Christmas, and the kid's getting his f***ing present!""",Bad Santa

One for it's crude humor, and two for the swan song of John Ritter. If you've ever heard or read anything telling you not to bring your kids, you'd better believe it. This movie rivals ""Scarface(1982),"" and ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back(2001),"" with the use of the F-word. Billy Bob Thorton is a believable rotten Shopping Mall Santa Claus. Part of the problem is that he's too believable. Willie is of course a crooked Santa working with a black dwarf named Marcus(Tony Cox)and his wife Lois(Lauren Tom) on a burglary racket. After finally pulling off what he thinks is going to be his last heist, he's convinced he's going to quit the low life, and live the high life in an outdoor Florida bar. One year and 10,000+ bottles of booze later, he's right back in the dumps, and has to go back to his crooked Santa routine to get back on his feet. His ex-partner invites him to a shopping mall in Phoenix, Arizona -- not exactly a part of the country known for being a winter wonderland to fill your heart with Christmas cheer. That mall is managed by Bob Chipeska(John Ritter), who is nowhere near like Jack Tripper. He's a meek, ultra-conservative type who would be baffled and repulsed by the antics of the former Three's Company character, which means Willie's hardcore drinking, profanity and sexual trysts with overweight female shoppers displease him even more. Threatening to fire Willie and his partner in crime, they both play the race card on him, so he buckles.Bernie Mac is Gin, the no-nonsense head of mall security who's not as much on the side of law & order as you might think, which is something you'll find out later on. Lauren Graham is a barmaid with a Santa-fetish, which means she found the perfect boyfriend in Willie. Interestingly enough, she's Jewish. Brett Kelly is one of numerous kids who visits Willie at the mall, but unlike the others, he saves him from a psychotic man who accuses him of homosexual advances, but can't save himself from a gang of skate punks who frequently harass him, his own bad grades, and an embarrassing name. Cloris Leachman is the kid's senile Grandmother who's assigned to take care of him while his widowed father, a white-collar criminal is in prison. This Kid doesn't exactly have the best childhood, but it's still better than Willie's. When he stars using the kid's father's car to get to work, the bar, and everywhere else, Gin looks for the license plate and traces it his jailbird Daddy. Finding out he's not involved, and that the job is strictly that of Willie and Marcus, he blackmails them and tries to muscle in on their scheme. Don't let the reviews fool you. As bad as Willie is, he does develop a conscience...to some extent. While attempting suicide through carbon monoxide poisoning, he notices the kid he's taking care of had a black eye from the skate punks, and proceeds to beat the holy hell out of the ringleader. I would've flung some of the skateboards at the heads of his fleeing gang, but that's just me. Still, things seem to end up working out for the gang. On the night of the big heist, Marcus and Lois turn on Gin. Unfortunately, they also turn on Willie, who's no longer content with pretending to be Santa at the mall or in the bedroom. Like Jake and Elwood Blues who were determined to get money for the orphanage to the tax collector even if they get caught by the law, Willie's determined to get little Thurman Murman his gift even if he faces similar circumstances.As evidence that Hollywood isn't as cruel as Willie, John Ritter's memory was honored in the credits. Still, it'll leave you to wonder if there were more scenes and lines planned for him.",Bad Santa
114,Cinema_Fan,"Christmas Comes but Once a Year, but Beware, Bad Santa is ALWAYS Near.",7,4 March 2006,"You can very quickly become admirers of other peoples work, be it acting, art, music, charity, or in this case writers, such as Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, who both having written between them the exceedingly funny movie, Cats and Dogs (2001). Here, they have given us a very grown up adaptation of a Christmas fable, Bad Santa. Their interpretation consists of a very witty and realistic polar opposite of what we have been very much used to as towards Christmas Movies and their message of Love, Forgiveness, Faith and Charity.Bad Santa touches on the concept of the Chinese Yin and Yang philosophy, which even the dark Yin can some times transcend into the light that is Yang. To understand that the narcissistic mentality that is Bad Santa will, one day, but not on his own terms either, realise that there is a wider World of responsibilities and self worth, this is done in a sensitive manner, even when the humour seems coarse, offensive and callous, to say the least.Having gone all out crude, rude and lewd, the script never fails to sag, and with great zest, to shock, but if you see through the adult language and theme that Bad Santa holds, then you will see a movie of self awareness, sensitivity and compassion, and through its quick delivery of witty dry sardonic humour, this is a first class exploitation of sentimentality, seen through the eyes of the drink afflicted loser of no fixed abode that is Bad Santa, and The Kid, that bonds himself to Santa, as his substitute guardian. Leaving you to feel utterly charmed by The Kids determination to have someone to look up to and to be Loved, even through his choice might be a little misguided.It's The Kids performance of the lonely but ostensibly naive performance that wins us over, in the face of adversity and parental neglect.Besides a very good script, it also takes a good team in front of the camera; this is done by a great combination of talented actors, via Billy Bob Thornton, as Bad Santa, Tony Cox as his assistant Marcus and the amazing young ten-year-old Brett Kelly as The Kid, also, as the Store Owner we have Bernie Mac. The late John Ritter, (1948  2003), plays the uptight Store Manager, he also played the role of Police Chief Warren Kincaid in the 1998 movie The Bride of Chucky.It also goes to show that when a movie, such as Bad Santa, has nine nominations for various Awards, such as the BET Comedy Award for Bernie Mac, 2004, the Golden Globes Award for Billy Bob Thornton, 2004, and the Phoenix Film Critics Society Awards for Best Performance by a Youth in a Lead or Supporting Role  Male, for Brett Kelly, also 2004, amongst other nominations, the only actor to actually win was Brett Kelly. Well done.Bad Santa delivers the goods on time, with it's hidden message, that Bad doesn't always mean Bad, but that even good honest all year round Christmas Sprit can win over the meanest of Scrooges, Bad Santa is a hugely funny movie, try it out, as Christmas only comes once a year, but Compassion is a Human trait that should never be left for any one Season.Merry Christmas SantaHo, Ho, Ho.",Bad Santa

⚪
All in all, this flagrant Christmas comedy brings you a nastily funny experience, as it shows what happens when Santa is the one who has been very naughty, and even if it could have been a little more vicious and uglier, as well as it could have used a some more laughs that don't only rely on vulgar language, Thornton's performance as the heartless and bad-mannered conman, as well as the heart it eventually displays make up for it and make it a crude character study with comedic elements rather than a black comedy, but in the end, it pays off and manages to become a flawed but weirdly fascinating festive flick.
⚪
Continuing my undertaking of watching festive comedies, I thought it'd also give one a try that is generally claimed to be one of the best genre titles of the twenty-first century. I had planned on checking it out for years, and now that the time has finally come and I was able to witness what the fuss is all about, I am actually kind of surprised by the outcome. From what I have heard, this flick is supposed to be the ultimate Christmas black comedy, full of naughty jokes and inappropriate humour, but honestly, I was admittedly underwhelmed. Indeed, there were moments of dark humour and crude jests, but there were only a handful of them. Instead, the film consists mostly of coarse language, the same repeated jokes and well, questionably unfunny conversations with no real punchlines. Was it still a terrible film, though? Well, funnily enough, it wasn't that bad, nevertheless. The reason why it somehow worked out was undeniably Bill Bob Thornton's performance as the miserable conman. With seemingly no effort he breathed life into the character who ends up being the only one that is fully elaborated and not bland. He is an antisocial, vicious, drinking and smoking jerk who treats all people accordingly terribly, and even he isn't thoroughly funny, he is utterly interesting as a character. We learn that he has had a rough past, that his father abused him and that he was always a criminal. Surprisingly, the villain begins to befriend a little boy who believes he is the real Santa, even though he is obviously a robber. That moment I knew what this film is really about: it is a character study rather than a black comedy, as it depicts the way the cold-hearted conman develops and turns into a man that is able to show sympathy for others. The rest of the story is solely a means to an end, the lack of jokes somehow explained. However, even it that is a factor that distinguishes it from other titles of the genre, it is still no excuse for certain other issues. As mentioned above, the humour is monotonously vulgar, in many scenes non-existent, and, well, anything but hilarious at all. Honestly, the few moments I laughed can be counted on the fingers of one hand, and that is somewhat sad for a black comedy. Furthermore, the writers put way too much effort into designing the protagonist that they seemingly forgot to give the supporting characters any notable personality. His sidekick Marcus, played by Tony Cox, is only defined as a small crook, The Kid is only described as being dumb, and his love interest Sue, portrayed by ""Gilmore Girls"" superstar Lauren Graham, is a bartender with a fetish for Santa Claus (as a fan of the series, it was utterly disturbing to see Lorelai Gilmore behave like that, tbh). The thing is, their personalities are kept at a minimum and appear poorly conceived in direct comparison to Willie. It is simply way too tame to make its reputation of being a black comedy justice. It surprisingly has a lot of heart in the end an even manages to be extremely touching, but in terms of comedy, this film disappoints completely. Don't get me wrong, it is rewatchable in some unexpected way, but since the Coen brothers produced this, I was hoping for a little more wit and ingenuity. Not a terrible film, but by far not as hilarious as I expected it to be.",Bad Santa

You can have a main character who's a terrible person, but if he's not interesting or funny at all, then it will likely be the most annoying thing imaginable. And for the most part, it was.Yes, there are a few chuckles to be had, and the acting is actually pretty great from everyone, but everything else about this film is either irritating or boring, and on top of that, it absolutely reeks of bad early 2000s comedy, with one scene in particular being a knockout one-two punch of a little casual racism and homophobia, but even if it didn't have that, it's just not pleasant to watch. It feels overly mean-spirited and nasty, which makes its relative lack of laughs sting even worse.I know there aren't all that many really great Christmas films out there, but there are definitely better ones than this.",Bad Santa
119,basrutten,Hollywood needs more comedies like this one!,8,7 January 2005,"I normally dislike comedies. First of all because they usually clock in at around 90 minutes, which means that they offer very little value for your money. And secondly because most of them really aren't that funny. The typical comedy is predictable and plays it way too safe. I also dislike Christmas movies because they're all basically telling the same sugary sweet story all over again.Enter ""Bad Santa"", a comedy and a Christmas movie that breaks just about every written and unwritten convention for both genres. There's no message, no cuteness, and no morals whatsoever. In this movie, Santa is a womanizing, cursing and drinking bastard who ""befriends"" a seriously troubled little boy just so he can rob his parent's house, and robs department stores together with his calculating little Elf helper. Just about every other character in the movie is severely anti-social and/or disturbed as well. Good taste is nowhere to be found and this is about as politically incorrect as movies get.Of course, all of this does not guarantee a good movie. I've seen more movies that fit the above description (""Scary Movie"" and its sequel come to mind), but in this case I found everything to be hilarious. I can't remember having laughed so much and so loud during a movie in quite a while. ""Bad Santa"" is rude and crude, but not just for the sake of it.You can't pull of a brilliant movie like this without good actors, and there are plenty of them in bad Santa. While just about every one of them plays a role that's fairly atypical for them, they all do a great job. Most notably, Billy Bob Thornton has the time of his life as the foul-mouthed title character, but it's also great fun to see Lauren Graham from the very family-friendly ""Gillmore Girls"" series play a crazed bimbo for once.Of course, that's a highly subjective statement. I can understand that there are people who are disturbed by all the foul language and politically incorrect behaviour and will NOT find this funny. Those people should IMHO take note that everything in ""Bad Santa"" is so deliberately over the top that it's hard to take it seriously. There's a lot of antisocial behaviour, but it's perfectly clear that everybody involved in the movie KNOWS how ""wrong"" the movie is, and no attempt is made to justify the behaviour whatsoever. I've seen movies that appeared to be a lot more civilized, but contained far more disturbing things.All in all, in daringly breaking with just about every convention of the comedy genre and Hollywood movies in general, the makers of ""Bad Santa"" have created a very rude but equally funny movie.Recommended (but don't show it to your children).**** out of *****",Bad Santa

I've started watching it as a Christmas tradition and it's still gut-busting rollicking whenever I view it.

It is so uncouth and offensive that most people will and probably should stay away from it, but those of us that like many good laughs will love it. Billy Bob Thorntons performance is pure brilliance. One of the best comic performances ever, it is so annoying how the Acadamy Awards always ignores comic performances. The screenplay is also particularly strong. It is brave with great character development and dialogue. The direction and the performances beyond Thornton are all also very strong, particularly Bernie Mac. Watch the movie only if you are not offended easily, and like to laugh",Bad Santa
123,ldavis-2,"Bad Santa! Bad, Bad Santa!",3,11 December 2003,"Willie is, as his partner likes to remind him, a pathetic loser whose only redeeming quality is that he's a crack safe cracker. Marcus, the partner, is a foul-mouthed midget with even fewer redeeming qualities. For the past six years, they have hired themselves out as a cut-rate department store Santa/Elf act so they can rob the place blind on Christmas Eve. But in order to make it to Christmas Eve, Marcus must keep Willie in line, which is getting harder and harder to do, because when he doesn't show up blasted, get medieval on Rudolph, swear at the kids, soil his beard, and urinate on himself, he's giving large-sized ladies ""stocking stuffers"" in the fitting room. Their new employer throws over a perfectly good Santa for our dynamic duo (forget wondering why their reputation hasn't preceded them), only to find himself stuck when realizing that firing an African-American little person would not be good for public relations. Then there's Sue, a bartender with a Santa fetish; Gin, the mall's security chief who gets wise to our heroes; and Thurman, a friendless and disturbed boy who lives with his senile grandmother and thinks that Willie is the real Saint Nick!Yet, on it's giddy, anarchic E-ticket ride to Hell, something even worse than Willie's idea of a tostada happens: Bad Santa loses its nerve, turning on a plot device totally out of Willie's character - an obvious cave to the pressure Disney put on its Mini-Me, Dimension - and becomes the very sticky-sweet Christmas story it's sending up!Unlike Zwigoff's brilliant Ghost World, Bad Santa is clunky, the scenes are disjointed, and the movie degenerates into a one-joke premise. The characters' actions are baffling at times: Willie has berated Thurman all film long but turns on him with righteous anger when Thurman berates himself.I wonder what Brett Kelly's agent was thinking when he passed the script onto his parents, and what were THEY on when they said yes? What is said at and happens to Thurman is nothing less than child abuse. Worse, Zwigoff legitimizes the abuse by having Thurman taking a page out of Willie's book (after a boxing lesson, which, I admit, had me laughing silly!) Humbug!",Bad Santa

125,Brogan,"Ho, ho, ho. Ha, ha, ha!",9,25 November 2003,"Leave it to director Terry Zwigoff to make a movie like this.  It felt like I was staring at a pile of vomit on the ground for 90 minutes, yet I was fascinated and intrigued while looking at the vomit.  What I mean to say is that what I saw on screen was offensive and vulgar, however I was entertained and even enjoyed what I was watching. Willie T. Soke (Billy Bob Thorton) is a drunken loser, a man who is not afraid to drink until he pukes, or urniates on himself in public.  During the holiday season Willie and his short partner Marcus (Tony Cox) work at shopping malls or department stores as Santa Claus and his little elf. Then when Christmas Eve comes, Willie and Marcus make a late night visit to the department store, breaking into the store safe and running off with the money, and plan on doing it again the following year. The next holiday season, Willie and Marcus arrive in Phoenix and take a job at a shopping mall, convincing the mall manager (the late John Ritter) that they will work for almost nothing and by not hiring ""little person"" Marcus is discriminating against short people.  Yet this time around, Willie meets a attractive and sultry cocktail waitress Sue (Lauren Graham) who gives out a unique pleasure of why she wants to fornicate with Willie. Plus Willie befriends a shy yet sensitive kid (Brett Kelly) who has Willie stay with him at his fancy house with his clueless grandmother (Cloris Leachman). But the head mall security guard Gin Slagel (Bernie Mac) has his suspicions of the mall's new Santa and friend and does a investigation of their background. For starters, just because the title of the movie has ""Santa"" in it, doesn't make it a sequel to ELF.  This is one movie that the kids should stay away from.  But this is one of the most enjoyable dark comedy I have seen in a while.  Like I said eariler, you normally wouldn't be laughing at what is being shown on the screen, but you can't help but chuckle. Thorton's character of Willie has to be the most sleezy character in cinema history.  Willie is so vulgar that he makes Travis Bickle look like a saint.  But Thorton since a lot of us have seen Thorton's personality and behavior in public, this is a role that is very fitting for him.  Willie is the opposite of the typical hero, just when you think he might possibly redeem himself and become a decent person, he'll get drunk and do something foolish. I not only enjoyed Thorton's performance but also the supporting performances of Tony Cox, Lauren Graham, John Ritter, Bernie Mac, and Brett Kelly.  I am always pleased to see short people being given the chance to show their acting ability, such as Peter Dinklage in STATION AGENT, and Tony Cox is given the chance to show his wonderful acting in this film.  There are even some scenes in which Cox shares with Throton that has Cox steal the scene for comedy.  Graham also gives an enjoyable performance as the woman who still finds Willie attractive despite how disgusting he can be.  John Ritter (who is already being missed) shows his talent by playing the shocked and stunned mall manager who catches Willie doing some obscene actions at time.  Child actor Brett Kelly gives a good performance as the kid, avoiding the cliche standards of being a adorable and cute kid and instead appearing to look more like a real kid who could exist.  And Bernie Mac, who I always find enjoyable, gives a enjoyable performance as the corrupt and egotistical mall manager. Terry Zwigoff has made films about the ""outcasts"" of society with his films CRUMB and GHOST WORLD, which I highly enjoyed both of those films. Zwigoff does a good job again by being the person who likes his protagonists to be different from the Hollywood standards.  When other director's could have easily made Willie a likeable character right away, Zwigoff manages to keep Willie and other characters in this movie offensive throughout the film. This isn't going to be a box office hit, then again name one Xmas film that was successful in the box office and well liked (GRINCH and both SANTA CLAUSE films were successful in box office, but not well liked by many). But given some time, I can see BAD SANTA being a cult film, similar to other holiday films including A CHRISTMAS STORY, and IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. But this is the type of movie that isn't really a genuine holiday film, like GREMLINS and DIE HARD 1 & 2; which is where I would put BAD SANTA along with.  Yet it is entertaining and enjoyable, but when you are finished watching the movie, you'll more than likely say, I can't believe I watched that movie, and enjoyed it. **** (out of five)",Bad Santa
126,ScottDMenzel,Bad Santa is an extremely bad movie,1,2 December 2003,"I have seen the trailers and TV commercials for this movie. It looked different and I thought the stars in the film were decent. I love Terry Zwigoff's last two great films Ghost World & Crumb. I wanted to see John Ritter in his final role and I wanted laughs from the talented funny Bernie Mac. Unfortunately, I didn't get anything I wanted from this film. It just turned out to be another movie that proves that Hollywood keeps creating movies for the dumbing down of America and the fact that people laugh at anything.The movie starts off with Willie (Billy Bob Thornton) who is posing as Santa and his little friend Marcus (Tony Cox) who is posing as an elf. They are just finishing up their job at the mall, the day before Christmas. The mall is closing and then we see Marcus hiding in a snowman costume in the mall when it closes. He then lets Willie in the store and they go to rob the mall. They do this and have done this for many years before. They rob a mall and then disappear for a year and then go to another mall. That's what Willie and Marcus do for a living. They pretend they are a Santa and Elf combo and then rob the mall when Christmas comes. That's basically the storyline of the movie. Willie happens to be an alcoholic and can't stop drinking. It supposed to be funny that he's an alcoholic and does nothing but drink and curse throughout the film. Santa curses at the kids and comes into work drunk but no one ever seems to notice. This movie is so stupid on so many levels and I can't believe it actually got made. Mafia movie like cursing, plot holes and wasted performances ensues.The acting, well what can I say about the acting besides it was bad. I mean Billy Bob Thornton playing an alcoholic mall Santa, who would have thought he could do that? I mean wow it takes a lot of talent to play an alcoholic and curse throughout the movie. And Tony Cox another great addition to the movie actor hall of fame. The late great John Ritter, who was extremely wasted in the film and had a look on his face throughout the movie, which seemed to pose the question `Why, am I here?' John Ritter acted along side Billy Bob Thornton in a movie called Sling Blade, which was brilliant.  I guess the last movie ever made curse continues because I remember a lot of good actors and actresses whose last movies were horrible.  An example of this includes Chris Farley in Almost Heroes, John Candy in Wagon's East, and Aaliyah in Queen of the Damned. Well to continue on about the acting, there is Bernie Mac again who is also wasted. The guy is funny! Why can't they give him good lines, why do they always put him in these lousy 10-minute roles that serve no purpose? Why? The Kid (he didn't even have a name) played by Brett Kelly was really annoying and very stupid. To be honest, the film wasted all its talent.The script and dialog, which now I am not surprised by, stunk because John Requa and Glenn Ficarra wrote it and the last film they wrote was Cats & Dogs which was a horrible movie but not nearly as bad as this. The movie's dialog is along the lines of something we would see in a movie like Scarface, Goodfellas, or the Godfather. The movie uses the f-word over and over throughout the movie, it feels as though every other word in this movie is the f-word and there is absolutely no point for its use. The dialog is so lousy and brings nothing original to the big screen. They think because they use a lot of bad language that it will make the movie funnier which it doesn't it only makes it worse since there is no need for it and the performances are average if not poor all around.The director Terry Zwigoff has suffered from the Hollywood curse. He made two terrific Independent movies before this, Ghost World and Crumb, which in all honesty are brilliant and original. In fact, Ghost World is one of the best movies I have ever seen and is a personal favorite. When I walked out of the theater and realized that he directed this piece of garbage I just shook my head and thought damn you Hollywood for taking such a great director and paying him money to make this crap. The good news is that Terry Zwigoff is going back to the Independent films after this crap and making a movie called Art School Confidential which is another underground comic book from the writers of Ghost World so I am looking forward to that and I am glad he didn't let Hollywood drag him in fully and take all his talent away. I am hoping he just made this film to help fund the Art School Confidential movie and to take advantage of Hollywood and prove to them that the Independent Films are where the good stuff is.So in conclusion, a movie that is supposed to offend, make people laugh and provide an original storyline does nothing it promises. It is a huge waste of talent from both its actors and director. The film's trailer is more amusing then the movie. If you watch the trailer you seen enough and don't need to see the movie. This movie proves that crap can be made and people will see it. There is nothing funny about the movie. I love comedies but this is not funny. I cannot recommend this film to anyone because it is literally one of the most painful movies to sit through. It only runs 93 minutes but seems like it runs for 3 hours that's how bad this film is. Warn your friends, warn your family, warn anyone you can because Bad Santa is an awful movie and one of the years worst films. My final rating is a 1/10.",Bad Santa

128,RhapsodyReviews,"Not Funny, It's Cringe Worthy.",3,25 December 2019,"Review:
'Bad Santa' is a Christmas black-comedy film directed by Terry Zwigoff.
I'm not sure why this movie is so popular around Christmas time. I put it on and watched it with my wife thinking we were in for a funny comedy, but it turned out to be one of the most uncomfortable movies I sat through.
A miserable conman (Billy Bob Thornton) and his partner (Tony Cox) pose as Santa and his Little Helper to rob department stores on Christmas Eve. But they run into problems when the conman befriends a troubled kid, and the security boss (Bernie Mac) discovers the plot.
Billy Bob Thornton does a good job portraying the slim ball Santa. Everybody does a good job with what they are given to work with. Bernie Mac was great as the security guard who doesn't seem to care about the mall he is protecting. The standout to me was Tony Cox as Santa's little helper. He had great comedic timing and could bounce off of Thornton's one-liners. It was also nice to see John Ritter in what his last on-screen performance would be.
Where the movie falls flat is in its story and the fact that it's not funny. Seeing this evil man drink his life away with no regards for others, ruining children's Christmas and actually staying at ones house while his dad is in dad. It's creepy and made me feel weird. I didn't find it funny what-so-ever and was very disappointed with this film.
Overall, the movie has good performances, but when something is marked as a comedy film, I expect to be laughing at least a little. The story is dark and make me feel awkward and I wasn't the only one. Maybe this one just wasn't for me, but I can't recommend it.

129,Tiger_Mark,I thought the studios dumped their garbage after X-Mas?,1,6 December 2003,"Well, I guess a Christmas movie would not play well in the Spring, when studios dump the garbage they chose not to feature in the peak movie months. This movie was attrocious, I mean just horrible. Now let's be perfectly clear here, I don't mind profanity or attacks on sacred items. I am not taking the prude attitude that dismisses this film because of its questionable material. I am attacking it because it was bad movie making and not entertaining at all. Billy Bob Thornton is not funny in this. Hearing him casually use the ""F word"" is not funny. Bernie Mac has the worst edited part I can ever remember, does not do one thing that is funny. Sadly, John Ritter's trivia page will end with ""What was the name of the crappy movie Jon Ritter made shortly before dying. I was stunned at how bad this film was. I was sure it would be funny in a Farrelly Brothers kind of way, it had a good trailer. However, it is a stupid movie geared towards emotionally stunted Junior High School students. There is a character in the film that just follows this fat kid around calling him ""fatass"" and ""loser."" I think I realized after the film, that the kid must have been the screenwriter.

130,ryan_kuhn,"""It's A Wooden Pickle...""",7,13 February 2005,"If Quentin Tarantino had written a Christmas movie, it would be Bad Santa. Instead of Jules and Vincent, we have Willie (Billy Bob Thornton) and Marcus (Tony Cox). Willie plays Santa at department stores during the month of December while Marcus plays an elf, it helps that he is a little person. Willie and Marcus put up with a month of, for them, hell so that they can rob their store's safe on Christmas Eve. The other 11 months of the year, Willie is an alcoholic in Miami, when working, he's an alcoholic Santa Claus. During the movie, we see Willie and Marcus taking their show to Phoenix. John Ritter plays the security chief at Willie and Marcus' new home with wonderful flare as a man who kind of knows he shouldn't trust the new Santa, but can't quite figure out why. Bernie Mac plays another security man at the store, but he's onto the plan, and wants in. Mac is wonderful at playing a hard-ass character who also has a big smile on his face. But the real star in the movie is Brett Kelly who plays an overweight kid who's father is in jail and lives with his grandmother who only wants to make sandwiches (Cloris Leachman). Kelly comes to see Willie as Santa at the mall one day, then meets up with him after Willie gets off work. The kid sees a friendship of sorts, Willie sees the kid as a place to stay. A friendship of sorts emerges between the two, and none of it really seems forced. Lauren Graham (Gilmore Girls) plays a bartender who has a Santa fetish, meaning she is Willie's girlfriend of sorts and adds a woman's touch to the comedy. There are more f-words to make Tarantino blush, but is counter-balanced by the classic Christmas songs director Terry Zwigoff uses while we see Willie hungover go to work. A funny movie, a brief movie (just over 90 minutes), and one that is not-necessarily touching, but I did find myself rooting for characters to find the good in each other. Now anyone for some sandwiches?",Bad Santa
131,arthurclay,Great Santa!,8,14 June 2005,"I saw it two years ago and am now just writing a summary for it which is pretty pathetic on my part. I don't like Billy Bob and his movies don't do much for me but he was funny and entertaining here. The midget was just as funny and the scene between Bernie and Ritter when they discuss their Santa's unusual mating habits is outrageously funny. Thortnon's liberal use of the f word and some witty banter with the other actors/actresses alone make it worth watching. When the midget details the 3 B's and the girl yells out ""F me Santa!"" I almost had to turn it off I was laughing so hard. The fat kid is cute in it and you feel really really sorry for him like he's a lost puppy or a baby seal about to be clubbed. The ending is unexpected too but it keeps with the story so I can't dislike it. Give it a view if you hate Christmas or if you like funny Christmas movies.",Bad Santa
132,Ronin47,"Cool, but could have been so much better (**1/2)",6,27 November 2003,"All you need to know about this rude, dark holiday comedy is pretty much right there in the title. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing in this case. Billy Bob Thornton plays a department store Santa who is not exactly your ideal Santa. In fact, in the opening credits when the words ""Bad Santa"" appear, we're watching him vomit in an alley. He is a filthy, grumpy alcoholic who smokes and drinks constantly and cusses at the poor kids unlucky enough to sit in his lap and tell him what they want for Christmas (as if he cares). His disregard for the job has to do with the fact that he plans to rob the store, with the help of his friend, a black dwarf (Tony Cox) who works with him as his ""elf"". Every year they pick a different department store and wait until Christmas Eve to crack the safe. Even though ""Bad Santa"" is generally a one-joke movie, it's a very good joke, and the movie gave me a lot of pretty solid laughs. However, I wish they would have done a little MORE with it. There are just too many jokes that fall depressingly flat, and other aspects, like Bernie Mac's store detective character, that just don't deliver like they should. Bernie Mac is a hilarious guy, and that character should be FUNNY, but it's just not. If this script had gone through a few more drafts to punch up the weak areas, it could have been a really great comedy. There is a lot of good stuff. I really liked Thornton's foul-mouthed, humorously ill-tempered character, and his relationships with a lonely, chubby kid (Brett Kelly) who keeps following him around, and with a sexy bartender (Lauren Graham of TV's ""Gilmore Girls"") with a Santa fetish. The scenes involving any combination of these 3 characters are very well done, but that's only about half the movie. Director Terry Zwigoff has two masterpieces under his belt (""Ghost World"" and ""Crumb""), and ""Bad Santa"" obviously doesn't come close to those, but it definitely has lots of his cynical, sarcastic style. I really wanted to give this movie 3 stars, and it came close, but in the end I was just a little too disappointed that it's not quite as good as it should be. A little more work and it could have been a classic; as it is, it's still pretty good.",Bad Santa

But along comes this fat loser of a kid who becomes their friend and that's the story. The ending is ridiculous.As i said, not much humor in this attempt at black comedy but the characters are interesting.

Praise the lord!) but our hard drinking anti-hero makes only the mildest connection with a 'retarded fat boy' in what is a predictable manner; and then makes great comedy out of even that.Billy Bob Thornton has found something he's good at. His comic / pathetic character with occasional hound dog looks was pretty much perfect for this film of low life scammers playing at Santa and Robbers. We are asked to find a career drunk funny - so the foul mouthed script is played necessarily for laughs not dramatic effect. And there are plenty of laughs.

Absolutely not children friendly and not afraid of insulting anyone, yet with a very kind tone at its core.

Billy Bob Thornton carries the whole movie, he's just fabulous as Santa Willie, as is the little kid, played by Brett Kelly. Of the supporting cast John Ritter has some good laughs and of course Tony Cox, who is the perfect counterpart for Thornton.

Anyone who wants to say how Billy Bob Thornton's character ""evolved"" by the end has to ignore all the other hateful, cruel, terrible, mean, vindictive, violent, sexist, abusive things he did throughout the film.We are asked to believe that this absolutely horrible human being (Thornton) can get away with stealing cars (but only good ones), ""dry"" screwing jail-bait in public, drinking himself to death at every available opportunity, talking to all children with the foulest mouth imaginable (even though Bernie Mac, as some kind of ""store detective"" -- or whatever the hell he was, said that he didn't -- and therefore, couldn't be fired from his ""Santa"" job), talking to every human being as if he/she were an amoeba, treating all children like garbage, and doing whatever the f**k he wants. There is even a scene where the main ""kid"" (Brett Kelly, the only actor besides Lauren Graham and John Ritter who actually gave their their characters depth) slices open his hand (making a gift for Billy Bob) and is running through the house screaming. And good ol' drunk Billy Bob doesn't even have enough brains to make sure he's okay. Yeah, he poured some alcohol on his cut, then he drank the alcohol. Ha ha ha. Then the kid goes running out of the room screaming and we, as audience members, are supposed to somehow sympathize,empathize, and/or laugh at Billy Bob? The kid was BLEEDING from a big GASH in his hand. Everyone associated with this disaster, most importantly, the parents who allowed their children to have their Christmases ruined for life so they could have be in a ""big Hollywood movie,"" should all bow their heads in shame. I was absolutely disgusted at what the filmmakers allowed the children to see and hear.If your idea of ""fun"" is to watch a drunken, foul-mouthed pig and his obnoxious foul-mouthed dwarf associate grab every possible opportunity to use the ""F"" word, then by all means, waste your money on this piece of garbage.If you think there are ways to learn valuable life lessons without exposing children (yours and all the poor child actors that had the misfortune to be in this child abuse epic) to the guttural ramblings of a pathetic loser, then do not waste 93 precious life minutes watching this.This film was ""recommended"" to me by my ""friend"" -- boy, am I going to set her straight.I cannot stress how disturbing it is that major Hollywood actors committed to ""perform"" in this pile of sh*t (another word they loved to use throughout). Yes, there were about five laugh-out-loud jokes. Okay, yeah, great. So what? Five jokes don't make a movie... unless it's ""Bad Santa.""I am not a prude or a conservative. I can laugh at potty mouth jokes with the best of them; but I do not think it is correct to expose a child to language and behavior that is absolutely uncalled for. Did Mommy and Daddy take their precious babies to see their big ""debuts"" only to have to cover their eyes in horror when some pole dancer shows us her gash? Was it okay for Mr. and Mrs. Kelly to let their baby Brett walk in on Billy Bob as he was about to remove Lauren's panties with his rotting teeth? Oh, yeah, boy, was that funny.There is ""funny"" and there is ""tasteless and crude."" Who am I to say? After all, this movie was nominated for a Golden Globe! So, there you have it. What do I know.But since this is MY opinion: This film rates a big NO.",Bad Santa
140,gws-2,The Blackest of Black Comedies,8,27 November 2003,"""Bad Santa"" is a very funny movie but it has a core of sadness and desperation.  Billy Bob Thornton, as the funny but sad and desperate title character, could not have been better. No genre is harder to pull off than black comedy but this film succeeds -- in spades.  It's raunchiness is off the charts but I can't remember when I have laughed out loud so often.  Nevertheless, I was moved by the film's surprising and effective ending.  Highly recommended; 8 out of 10.",Bad Santa
141,FeverDog,Bad Santa! Bad! Bad!,3,11 November 2003,"*SPOILERS*I wasn't much of a fan of GHOST WORLD, Terry Zwigoff's last movie, but since it's so beloved by movie geeks everywhere I figured it was just one of those movies I just don't get.  BAD SANTA, on the other hand, will be hard-pressed to find such fervent admirers since it's a candidate for the worst comedy of the year.A holiday-themed movie with a misanthropic sense of humor can be very funny, as anyone who's seen THE REF can attest.  But what separates the good from the bad is the quality of the writing - the creation of mean-spirited characters who are sharp-witted but have identifiable human traits.   The characters in BAD SANTA are not funny in any clever or original way; they're straight out of an Adam Sandler movie: undeveloped, anti-social, hostile.There's a fine line between comedy and cruelty, and this movie crosses it. Take the kid, for example.  The filmmakers dress him in ill-fitting clothes and have snot running down his nose.  Nasal fluid can be funny if something amusing is done with it, like in THE NAKED GUN.  But just a gross runny nose is just gross, and not fun to look at on a large movie screen.Boy, is this kid weird in an unbelievable way.  Bullies give him a wedgie but he seems okay with walking around a mall without dislodging it.  In another scene he sits next to a middle-aged adult who's relaxing in a bath, which is creepy in a way the director probably hadn't intended.  A child young enough to sit on Santa's lap shouldn't be watching him bathe naked. Later, he cuts his hand making a present for Santa: a ""wooden pickle,"" which he gives to him while in mid-seduction with the movie's stock love interest.  Its resemblance in shape and size to a dildo makes the moment a pretty good time to give such a gift, I suppose.Santa is, of course, Billy Bob, an actor I've admired for years.  He does his best with the lousy material he's been given, but even Olivier couldn't make this character work.  He's ill-served by the serious miscalculation in tone.  His Santa is alcoholic, a criminal and borderline-violent.  I wish the movie would have dropped its failed attempt at comedy and dealt with this promising character in a serious manner.  When he hooked up with a barmaid with a Santa fetish, I wished for the movie to morph into LEAVING LAS VEGAS.  (I didn't get my wish.  See?  There really is no Santa Clause.) His violence comes out against the kid's bully, whom he, to put it bluntly, kicks the crap out of.  I guess it's supposed to amuse us to watch an adult beat up a teenager.  This Santa is one that'll make children cry and parents angry (one scene has him drunk, uncouth and wrecking the holiday display because he can barely stand), but nobody seems to do anything about it.The booze jockey, by the way, is, like all the supporting roles, terribly underwritten.  There's some cursory talk about why she is the way she is, but nothing becomes of anything until the end (which I'll get to the ending later).  Her first sexual encounter with Santa is somewhat funny, but the movie later repeats the joke, which wasn't funny enough to sustain two scenes.All we learn about Bernie Mac's security chief is that he's an incontinent, ethically challenged chain-smoker with a penchant for pedicures.  If that sounds like a shallow, awfully random collection of character traits, you're putting more thought into him than the writers did.  If it sounds funny, then by all means see this movie, since this character is likely never to be used again.John Ritter's final screen appearance is just as thin, and practically unnecessary to the movie.  He's given only a few scenes, and they're all lacking in humor, and a point.  You can glimpse his embarrassment in the performance, like he knows his role is unworthy of his talent.  He disappears from the movie during Act 3 (which I'm getting to).Before I get to the ending, let me object to the gratuitous use of profanity in BS (rarely does a movie's initials become an accurate assessment of its content).  F-bombs are dropped from beginning to end, with no creativity, wit, or point.  Curse words, when used with panache, can explode off the screen to shock laughs from the audience.  Quentin Tarantino knows how to do this.  But the filthy mouths of the characters in BS made me want to wash them out with Lifebuoy soap (an homage to A CHRISTMAS STORY, a movie that will still be around long after prints of this one have been turned into landfill).Now, the ending.  Never mind the movie's near-turn to contrived sentimentality (barf).  The movie knew this would be predictable and false (gee, Bad Santa *does* care!), so it was more or less dropped.  So let's get to the real ending.  Only in a bad Hollywood movie does a holiday comedy end with a shoot-out, a murder, a car chase, and an attempted murder by the police, who fill an unarmed, fleeing man with bullets, after which a bartender agrees to become a foster parent to a weird kid whom she's barely spoken a word to.  (If you can explain to me how the police were tipped off to BS's criminal plans, you have amazing intuition, since the details are so confusingly presented in the movie I gave up trying to figure it out.) I'm not even sure what happens to BS when all is said and done; it seems like a happy ending, but shouldn't he be facing major jail time?  The way the voice-over explains it, he gets off scot-free because the police don't want bad publicity.  Any connection to reality exists only in the writer's addled mind.Which pretty much sums up BS as a whole.  Nothing that happens in it is plausible, or interesting.  The Coen Brothers get a story credit, but what does that mean?  Their unique touch is nowhere to be found here, making me wonder exactly what a ""story"" credit means.  Was their involvement the reason Billy Bob signed on?  It has to be, since nothing in the final product would indicate otherwise.  And I wonder why Cloris Leachman, in the role of the kid's grandmother, didn't have a screen credit either at the beginning or the end.  Odd, since Alex Borstein (MAD TV's Mrs. Swan), who is in only one brief scene, receives an opening credit.  (She left the SNL rival for this?)  Same thing with Ajay Naidu, who plays a meds-deficient kook who assaults BS for thinking he's gay. (Don't ask, since his two scenes are so inexplicable I assume the bulk of his role is on the cutting room floor.) Why?  I know I shouldn't harp on stuff like this, but BAD SANTA gives me so little else to think about.3/10",Bad Santa
142,Jexxon,Merry f-ing Christmas,8,27 December 2004,"A definitely not PC Yule-tide film about one foul mouthed department-store Santa who works extra as a burglar. Not much happens in the way of plot, other than seeing Thornton struggle to get to grips with an odd kid who takes a liking to him, I guess you could say it's sort of an allegory (check your dictionaries, kids) of the Grinch.It's certainly refreshing to see a Christmas film that isn't coated with syrup, and that dares to brake some conventions as to what's appropriate or not. It's a dark comedy that's not only very dark, but also very funny. Thornton is extremely believable as the self hating Santa, and the rest of the cast is equally good.The film also deserves applauds for not chickening out - this is hardcore adult fun all the way. For those who can appreciate this kind of films, Bad Santa is a real treat. [8/10]",Bad Santa
143,udeaasykle,This is one bad Santa,7,7 July 2004,"This is one funny movie. I don't care if people say it is rude and crude, that is what I like about it. A movie with almost no moral and ethics, and I love it. Billy Bob does a great job as the drunken warehouse Santa with some hilarious consequences. He drinks, he curses and he is the worst Santa ever. I had heard good things about this movie so I had high expectations when I saw it. And I wasn't let down at all. I have read that Billy Bob actually was drunk while shooting this film. All in all there are 243 profanities in the movie, not exactly a holiday spirit kind of movie. But, if you love rude movies like I do, you are going to love this one. This movie has is all, great acting, great story and a great comedy.

144,jbartelone,"Bad, It Certainly is!",2,19 February 2007,"Bad Santa is downright revolting and disgusting. A pathetic loser, along with his elf sidekick, goes around department stores while robbing them, and being a Santa Clause, while trying to throw out as many F-bombs as he can in this piece of trash! I can not think of ONE good redeeming quality to this film, not one. The only thing that saves me from sending this garbage to the trash bin, NOT to be recycled, is the performance of ""The Kid."" But even that takes too long to get going, There is no compassion or sensitivity to any of the characters. I really just sat around waiting for Billy Bob Thorton's character to die. The impression for me is that the world would be a far better off place without him.Let me say that I can handle profanity WHEN you have a story with a powerful impact that the language reflects the scenery or the characters within the movie. (For instances, classics like Raging Bull, or the very good movie, Good Will Hunting.) However, Bad Santa's characters and storyline serve ONLY to be obscene without purpose, plot, or development. I can understand that movies out there can have S.O.B protagonists. But the filmmakers need to show some responsibility and give the movie goers a quality script and storyline to give us a REASON for caring about why they are S.O.B's.In Bad Santa, Billy Bob Thorton hates the world without reason, he wants no sympathy from anyone else or offers any reason to care about him. All he has are two words (or variations of them) for everyone ""F**CK You!"" Well, I just want to scream back at him, ""Same to you, loser!"" Watch a real classic Christmas movie with drama, comedy, and great acting such as A Christmas Story. Leave ""Bad Santa"" to die in his own self-centered misery.This film gives new meaning to the word crap!",Bad Santa
145,Hawkensian,A surprisingly funny alternative Christmas film.,7,20 January 2012,"This narratively clichéd yet entertaining alternative Christmas film is one definitely worth seeing if you're sick of 'It's a Wonderful Life'. Billy Bob Thornton stars as Willie, a safe-cracking crook who masquerades as Father Christmas every December in shopping malls across the United States. His token elf accomplice Marcus, who is a 'little person', exploits his miniature frame to hide in the malls after opening hours, hastily cancelling the security system so Bad Santa can waltz in and get to work on the safe. Their set-up is working smoothly, however things begin to change when Willie befriends and pities a young boy and a security boss begins to hone in on their activities. I found myself laughing on many occasions, thanks to contributions from almost all the cast, especially Bernie Mac. The humour was tainted however by the language, which soon became gratuitous and puerile. Those two adjectives also describe Willie, his bad boy persona is exaggerated in many parts of the film; Willie will often needlessly erupt with foul-mouthed tirades that soon become tiresome. Films such as 'Goodfellas' and 'Scarface' contain more profanity, yet, oddly enough, I didn't find them gratuitous like 'Bad Santa'. The development of the relationship between Willie and Thurman, who is an adorably oblivious and good willed overweight child, is predictable but undeniably nice to watch. The boy is so pathetic, and I mean that in the true sense of the word, that you can't help but wish well for him.Apart from the sometimes grating dialogue, I'd recommend Bad Santa. It's an entertaining, politically incorrect and ultimately 'feel-good' film that puts a twist on the Christmas movie genre conventions. I think its dark humour will be especially agreeable with teenagers who aren't getting that increasingly boring and treacly 'Christmas feeling'.www.hawkensian.com",Bad Santa
146,CurtMan@LVCM.com,"Outrageous, Raunchy, Crude, Absolutely Hilarious!",10,28 August 2004,"""Bad Santa"" is a comedy of the darkest sorts: uncompromisingly crude, relentlessly profane, and shamelessly crass. Yet, with such perfunctory characteristics as its consistency, this film doesn't cloyingly abuse itself, resulting in a silly, inane outing, yet rather achieves a hilarity far, far above that of any average part-comic, part- sentimental comedy. ""Bad Santa"" sets a mean-spirited, perverse tone and never compromises that tone; the film is not consistently but constantly gross in its dark, profane manner, and you find yourself just as amused by the end as you were at the start, laughing hysterically at practically every outrageous, offensive element of this classic comedy. Billy Bob Thornton plays his role as an obscene, heartless, and pathetic drunken thug with such conviction and such expression that you become engulfed by the absolute misery (and hilarity) of his character. Add to that some of the most hilarious situations ever conceived (i.e. miserable Santa groping with happy children) and ""Bad Santa"" is one mean,audacious, and outrageous comedy. I can't imagine how any piece of film could be any more gut-busting hilarious in its crudeness and depravity: I can humorously relate with all of Billy Bob Thornton's miseries in this film... What could be funnier than a curmudgeon drunk posing as Santa Claus to innocuous little children and relinquishing his frustrations on the world while robbing people blind with his sidekick midget friend? Billy Bob Thornton is excellent as this miserable thug with a heart of coal, and practically every time he is on screen I find myself laughing hysterically! And who says a film can't be ingenious and entertaining while unabashedly crude and profane? In my sense of humor, the raunchier and more offensive, the funnier a film is, and ""Bad Santa"" more than exceeds these expectations for me. The funniest film I have ever seen; a pitch-perfect comedy not intended for ""family fare""! **** out of ****",Bad Santa

The kid is very good in his role and a cameo appearance by veteran actress Cloris Leachman as granny who seems to have the same line, ""I'll make you some sandwiches."" This is an adult movie, really not a movie for children due to the profanity. All in all, as I said, I found Bad Santa very enjoyable and you will too.

149,Sunsphxsuns,A FREAKIN' FUN FILM!,10,26 October 2021,"OMG where to begin with this one? I've written several reviews on holiday films, but none of the movies I discussed were anything like Bad Santa. It's really in its own wonderfully demented category. But don't take that as a referendum that I wouldn't highly recommend this movie. Quite the contrary, I love this crazy film! You MUST see it!One of several outstanding Christmas comedy films, Bad Santa is definitely one of the darkest. Directed by Terry Zwigoff and written by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, the film has admirable pacing. Its main star power comes from Billy Bob Thornton, with spectacularly hilarious and unforgettable performances by Tony Cox, Lauren Graham, Brett Kelly, Lauren Tom, with completely over the top performances by John Ritter and Bernie Mac. Sadly, Ritter passed away September 11, 2003, only a few months before Bad Santa premiered in November. Just as sad, Bernie Mac would pass away 5 years later on August 9, 2008. Their performances in this film remain legendary.Not surprisingly Bad Santa was an immediate critical and commercial success. It made money and eventually spawned a far less ambitious sequel 13 years later, Bad Santa 2, released in 2016.Like another holiday film I reviewed (2020's Fatman) Bad Santa isn't about your typical Santa Claus. Indeed, Mel Gibson's Fatman Santa actually possesses some magical abilities and still delivers toys to the world's good behaving children. The only trait Billy Bob's Santa has in common with Gibson's character is the apparent insatiable desire to be continuously flat out drunk.No spoilers here. I can only reveal that Bad Santa is a depressed, hard drinking safecracker who poses each year as a store Santa Claus before eventually relieving his employer of all the money in their safe. Bad Santa teams with an elf, too, named Marcus. The elf is the brains of the thieving duo, played by Tony Cox, who is so good in his role you wish he had even more lines.Bad Santa, like Fatman, casually destroys the sensitive parameters which define mainstream holiday movies. There's quite a lot of toilet humor here, but it's executed so deftly by the actors that you will definitely want to add it to your short list of ""must see"" Christmas films!",Bad Santa
150,Det_McNulty,"A Cynic's Perspective Of Christmas, Which Is Something That Works Brilliantly",7,24 June 2007,"Typically, around Christmas you will find yourself watching a generic, feel-good, moralistic ""Christmas movie"", Bad Santa is the ""reversed"" version of the Christmas genre. For those of you who are fed-up with clichéd Christmas films, Bad Santa is the perfect film for you, as it is an entirely altered perception of a now-consumerist holiday. No, Bad Santa is not It's a Wonderful Life, Miracle on 34th Street and nor is it Home Alone, yet it still incorporates features from all of those films and that is what makes it such a special take on the Winter holiday.Willie (played by Billy Bob Thornton) is a perverted, alcoholic, part-time conman, who during the Christmas season indolently works in shopping malls with his fellow criminal in disguise, Marcus (Tony Cox). Willie dresses as Santa, while Marcus (the more professional of the pair) acts the elf, due to his height. Throughout the tedious Christmas period, the pair use their job at the mall to exploit the opportunity to rob the store overnight. While working at a mall in Arizona, Willie meets a child who teaches him the meaning of Christmas, whilst falling in love with an attractive waitress and having law-enforcement hot on his trail.When a film starts off with a guy in a Santa outfit, sitting at a bar, drinking his life away you know you are not watching your average tale of ""good tidings"". From the crude opening narration, to the wonderfully inflated finale, Bad Santa is a taste of comedic genius. Billy Bob Thornton performs as a crude, dishonest cynic who hates everyone and everything. Bringing comedic energy and offensive characteristics to his character he impeccably balances the grumpy scrooge of Christmas with heart. I honestly believe that Billy Bob Thornton's performance in Bad Santa was worthy of an Oscar nomination.It is not a case of whether you are a lover of Christmas or not although, it would come as an advantage when viewing the film- as Bad Santa is continually entertaining and at times, even charming. Through its witty script, fuelled by grumpy, drunken humour it is almost impossible not to become entranced by the inconsiderate lines of raucous profanity. Director, Terry Zwigoff proves his quirky talent once again, after the success of 2000's Ghost World. Bad Santa is comedic bliss and a highly recommended comedy for fans of something a little more extreme than the average, feel-good Hollywood extravaganza.",Bad Santa
151,nzswanny,It is much more than a black comedy.,9,23 December 2016,"I expected to be really offended in this movie. I expected to hate this film. In fact, I even thought about not watching it. Luckily enough, I trusted my friends recommendation, and watched the film. I gotta say, it was really sweet, even if the lead wasn't super likable.The first half of the movie was not that great, but I forgive the film, because it gave us the introduction to the characters. The first half was basically just an offensive, crude comedy, even if some jokes were funny. But, the second half of the film I found was ten times more enjoyable.The second half was emotional, heart felt, and soft, even if the last three minutes was a bit, ""What?"" But, I gotta be honest, I laughed quite loudly at the first three minutes. The second half of this is really touching, funny, and quite nice.

152,MovieLuvaMatt,A disappointment,5,2 July 2004,"I feel like people were describing to me a totally different movie.  I knew this film was going to be dark, but it turned out much darker than I expected.  At times it doesn't even feel like a comedy.  The main character is a totally downbeat fellow, and as a result the film takes on a downbeat tone.  There are some absolutely hilarious moments, like when Tony Cox quips about what he was doing with Bernie Mac's wife last night.  But those moments are few and far between.  I honestly don't see what the critics and audiences found so special about this movie.  The plot is slow-moving, and the vulgarity gets repetitive and dull after a while.  Not to mention the premise could've been put to better use.  I always wanted to see a movie about a department store Santa who's a complete whack-job.  I think it's a premise that deserves a broad treatment, whereas Terry Zwigoff tries to make it into a realistic character study.  If it were, say, a Farrelly Brothers movie, I think they would've made better use of the premise.  Zwigoff directed the hugely impressive ""Ghost World,"" and the two films possess a similar tone, but in that film it was more useful.  Though also a comedy, ""Ghost World"" is meant to be a human depiction of what it's like to be an adolescent outcast.  ""Bad Santa"" isn't meant to have any sort of touching commentary on life.  And that's what bothered me about the subplot between Billy Bob and that chubby kid.  It felt so forced, and the director seemed desperate to tug at the audience's heartstrings between the barrage of offensive gags.  The cast is great, but none of them are used to their full advantage.  Bernie Mac is given an uptight, unfunny role and John Ritter was wasted in his last film appearance.  He's only in the movie for about 20 minutes, and plays such a thanklessly dorky role.  Don't believe the hype. Why this became the sleeper hit of last year is beyond me.

153,Aristides-2,Almost speechless (but not quite),1,23 February 2007,"It gets a 1 because voters are not permitted to go into minus numbers. There are more than several film genres I'm not sympathetic to but I can spend some time, brief time that is, with most of them. The kung-fu movies do need good fight coordination and editing and that can keep my interest for seconds at a time, though every one I've seen.....correction: the five minutes or so that I've endured with each, all have the same grevous fault; the villains all stand around waiting to be kicked and pummeled. To sit through this kind of faking asks me to suspend more of myself than I can possibly surrender. What thinking person could allow this kind of dishonesty to amuse? Gross out films occasionally provide gutter or Three Stooge-type comedy that one can smile at while at the same time 95% of the rest of the film eschews comic character for the sake of cliché performances of cardboard characters. Grossness per se is certainly not funny and can't substitute for humor. But 'Bad Santa'? Never folks, never have I seen a so-called comedy where no character in the film, repeat none, has any human quality that I could possibly like and relate to. Without these qualities that makes us who we are you find 'Santa's' actors saying lines and doing things that are detached from humanity. A coldness descends onto the silver screen because of this. Every minor and major character in this film is written and directed to be repulsive. Now many of the people who rave about this movie share a common thought of how wonderful it is to have an antidote to the usual sappy falseness connected with 'Christmas' movies. I say fine to this and will gladly sign up for the concept. But going to the extreme other end of humor, where it morphs into viciousness and gross behavior, defeats the whole idea of making banality stand out. Make fun of oozing Christmas religiosity in some Christmas films but don't confuse strong satire or parody with this extreme nihilism. 'Bad Santa' uses a nuclear bomb to destroy Christmas movie conceits that are fragile and phony to begin with. Weapons to use instead? How about a stiletto of wordplay, an Exacto blade of physical humor or even a couple dozen pies in the face?maybe a pie in the face. These would be my weapons of choice.",Bad Santa

The film revolves around two criminals who pose as a mall Santa and an elf, who rob stores every Christmas. But things get complicated when one of them befriends a socially awkward kid. This isn't inspired by Dr. Seuss's How the Grinch Stole Christmas, but this is a modern adaptation of How the Grinch Stole Christmas if the Grinch became an alcoholic. Seriously, Scrooge and the Grinch hated Christmas, but Scrooge and Grinch are like angels compared to Billy Bob Thornton. Bad Santa takes everything you know about Santa as being holly and jolly puts it in the trash, lights it on fire, and makes Santa the antagonist. The film also does a great job in turning your three main characters into Grinches as well and unlike many Christmas films, that are for family friendly audiences, this film reveals a much darker side of Christmas, but still gives it a happy ending.

159,Ana_Banana,This is the true Christian spirit (are you open-minded?),7,6 July 2008,"This is not your usual comedy. In fact, it's not only comedy, although it has some hilarious scenes. After watching it for the second time, I managed to reach under its crust of bad language, vulgarity, debauchery and crime. These are but the set and the fuel for a surprisingly complex and deep movie. Willie's development from total misery and desperation (a tragic state, isn't it?) to re-discover the values of being human, of respect and care for him and for others is carefully and naturally constructed.But to appreciate that, you need to be open-minded and go beyond the appearances of profanity and disgusting conduct. If you liked only conventional decorations and robotic gifts, don't watch this. First ask yourself what Christianity really means: not the ceremonies, not the priests and their hierarchy, not the opulence of cathedrals. It means to love your neighbor, to care for him and to respect him. And to love God. That's all.And that's why this movie is convincing. No bland preaching, just ordinary people, emotional situations implied, a natural narrative, a surprising script and great acting. Thornton is just plain brilliant. Brett Kelly as The Kid is tremendous: annoying, naive, direct, thoughtful and love-thirsty. They form one of the oddest couples seen on screen, but a captivating one, too. Special notes for Tony Cox as Santa's Little Helper, Bernie Mac (talk about greed, man!), and the seductive Lauren Graham.In a word, look under the surface of things. And I defy anyone with a soul to remain cynical and conceited as usual while watching the pink elephant scene. If Willie could achieve what he has achieved, anyone can.",Bad Santa

It offers balance to a world obsessed with having a wonderful life at yuletide.  For many, the truth is it ain't so wonderful for everyone.  Several people walked out of our theater: the tip-off that this film would be ""right up my alley"".  Billy Bob T was born to play a bum.  He personifies down-and-out, from his body to his scraggy beard.  Perfectly cast.  Tony Cox rocks as the nere-do-well con-elf.  Daffy Duck would call them ""despicable!""

162,Manthorpe,Gut bustingly hilarious!,9,14 January 2004,"I'll have to admit, I'm very hard to please when it comes to comedies and for the most part, I find them pretty lame nowadays. Bad Santa is an exception though. I can't remember the last time I laughed out loud repeatedly at the theater. Maybe it's the type of comedy we're dealing with here, sick and twisted, heh-heh. But for me, it was a non-stop giggle ride that never let up. Billy Bob was hilarious in this role!Santa and his midget elf friend have a history of heisting the shopping malls they work for every year and taking whatever they please. And every year Santa is more lewd, crude, drunk and trouble. An unsuspecting kid takes in Santa and gives him a place to stay because he believes he's the real Santa. All hell breaks loose when Santa is in town this year, and poor old John Ritter as the mall's manager and Bernie Mac as the security head, must deal with Santa and his halfling friend as the holiday gets closer. Santa's drunk, having anal sex in the big and tall womens' dressing room, and telling kids to bugger off, and planning on heisting the whole joint. How could Santa be better?Do not bring your kids to this movie! I don't have kids...actually I don't even like kids...well I hate kids and I was appalled that some parents had brought their 9 and 10 year olds to this show. There must be 180 f-bombs in this movie...practically every sentence that comes out of Billy Bob's mouth is the f-word. That's not to say they over use it, it's just that it's not for kids.I highly recommend this movie if you have a dark sense if humor, or if you aren't some uptight old snob that needs to lighten up.

The cut from Miami to Billy Bob and his partner walking down the street in their Christmas costumes is, on its own, worth the price of admission. Terry Zwigoff has transformed the crumbs of society into a sophisticated, adult, art form. Billy Bob and his sensational young co star Brett Kelly create characters never seen before on the screen and as a consequence we cling on to their every nuance, incapable to predict what could happen next.

That dense fat kid deserved that wedgie for eating all the pies. Quite enjoyed the movie in a shallow way, but looking back on it, it was really very desperate. Spoiler: funniest scenes were the midget guy's antics to deactivate the alarm before it armed. Good with rowdy mates and a beer, like Jackass. I suspect that this comedy could have been fantastic, the plot is a nice surmise, had the movie makers been a bit more ambitious. The pay off was implausible to the point of wrecking the movie.

Then again, by the end of ""AChristmas Carol"" even Scrooge is redeemed and the story endshappily; here you just get to walk home in the cold, less the cost ofyour theatre admission.I never imagined that I'd find a movie so laden with profanities thateven I would actually be sick of hearing them, but BAD SANTA didso.  Coarse language, used right, can arguably even add to theflow and characterization within a good film, I believe. Not this time. And having loved everything the incredibly talented Coen brothershave offered up previously (RAISING ARIZONA, BARTON FINK,THE BIG LEBOWSKI) I was utterly shocked to see their namesassociated with this utter piece of trash.  Obviously they didn'tdirect it, or have final say, or we might have actually had somethingedgy AND entertaining to watch in this misguided holiday offering.The problem does not lay in the, some might say, 'novel' idea; analcoholic and depressive, safe-cracking ex-con (Billy BobThornton) and his sharp-tongued, African-American, midget side- kick (Tony Cox) disguising themselves as Shopping-Mall Santaand Elf to get at the massive holiday store-vault holdings.  Nordoes the problem arise from bad acting; Billy Bob, John Ritter,Bernie Mac, and Tony Cox are all good and deliver finecharacterizations.  The problem lives in the sloppy directing,slipshod story and non-stop barrage of cursing and vile intentionsthrown into every scene.  Billy Bob plays his character straight, butis utterly repulsive, even when he's trying to be good, and hebecomes and remains impossible to love.  (Sure it's funny to seehim yell at a fat, runny-nosed little kid the first half-dozen times, butafter 60+ minutes without letting up...)  Bernie is funny, butmisused and seems thrown in at random points in the plot, and incompletely irrelevant scenes (obviously he's just there so he can""do his thing"" regardless of plot).  The best character in the film isthe Mall manager, played by the late John Ritter, who's every sceneis hilarious due to his delivery, but sadly he has so few scenes. Unfortunately, I suspect it's Ritter's much-loved reputation that willdraw more than half the audience to see his last picture, only to beforced through the mire the rest of the film wallows in.I don't expect every Christmas-themed movie to be all ""bells andangels"", and knowing that BAD SANTA might actually punch a fewholes in that tradition was what drew into seeing it, but I DO expectquality storytelling and filmmaking.  Somewhere along the wayZwigoff lost track of this project, or got carried away in it'sdemeaning nature, and the results became insulting, juvenile andunintelligible.  BAD SANTA is a wasted opportunity for some greatcomedic talent and a new holiday ""classic"", but much like yourAunt Flora's Christmas fruitcake, chances are you won't feel rightafter attempting to digest it.5/10.

Thinking it might be a fair film about a disgruntled man who makes a living as a lousy Santa Claus. Needless to say, my expectations about this movie were Luke warm at best. Boy! was I ever surprised! This movie was a laugh riot from start to finish! Billy Bob Thorton is nothing short of comedic perfection as ""Willie"" the low life, alcoholic, womanizing, safe-cracker, that slovenly goes through the facade of playing Santa. Tony Cox is a delight as his diminutive dwarf cohort that is just plain disgusted at Willie's unprofessionalism and inebriation. The supporting cast is good, but it really is the scenes of Thorton and Cox sparing with each other that are the best. It's true that this movie is NOT for everyone. It's level of raunchiness and crudity will offset a good number of folks. Personally, I loved it and couldn't stop giggling at it.",Bad Santa
168,alexcomputerkid,Bad Santa is a naughty and full of coal Christmas film.,8,18 January 2015,"You cay say I'm a Grinch if you want but Christmas has never been a high priority when it comes around every December for me. As a person who's main hobby includes writing, junior hockey and pretty much any other sport besides football, it seems to becomes harder and harder every year to find a present to ask for. Living right near a big suburban Detroit mall, I see the Christmas traffic and living in Michigan, snowstorm for sure has been seen. Sure, I still like this holiday because of the Christmas spirit and I could drink eggnog every day of the month if I wanted to. Also hours of NBA basketball on the 25th is always a relaxing treat.What's most ironic about this holiday is that it has pushed me away from films from this genre. Sure, I've seen the major Christmas films including Christmas Story, Elf, It's a Wonderful Life, Christmas Vacation, and Die Hard but I have missed stuff like Christmas Evil, Silent Night Deadly Night and the original Miracle on 34th Street.Bad Santa ultimately is the Christmas film for the people not interested in the holiday or that really just a need short a break from it all.Willie Stokes (Billy Bob Thornton) is a part time drunk and con man and along with his midget friend Marcus (Tony Cox), this duo is known to do scamming and a fair amount of stealing at a new mall every year while Willy plays Santa and Marcus plays an elf. While meeting a kid, Thurman Merman (Brett Kelly) at the new mall this holiday year, Willy finds the a new meaning of Christmas through this kid.It would be completely false to say the Willie character has nothing to him. He drinks non-stop, enjoys the local bartender Sue (Lauren Graham) due to the sex and he has no interest in being Santa or the kids once they are on his lap. Still, he takes an interest in Thurman. Thurman asks a lot of questions, can't stand up to bullies and lives in a very high end high house. The kid gives Willie such great character development, shows Willie the life of a kid which Willie likely would never ever see if he never have met him and gives Willie a proper testament to what this holiday really is.It surely is a nice story but we can't forget the humor attached to this movie. I've always found Thornton to be a funny guy, Tony Cox's character has the running gag of being a midget and the film is famous for using 173 F-bombs in the film and is on the list of the most F-bombs ever in a film. Even Bernie Mac shows up Gin Slagel, a chief of security of he mall and just like Thornton, Mac always knows how to provide laughs.This black comedy will cast a black eye for people looking for a traditional take on the Christmas holiday. It is Clearly also not for the little one's of the family. Bad Santa will always be different but definitely still adds some charm to the Christmas genre. It is a charm that makes this film recognized long after the fact and it clearly shows now due to how well Bad Santa has held up now over ten years after it's release.

A warning, though: don't take your kids to see it - especially if they still believe in Santa Claus. This will warp them forever. Actually, it's not really appropriate for kids at all, which is probably why it's so funny.Billy Bob Thornton is Willie, aka Bad Santa, a thief who works as a department store Santa to gain access. It's one of those types of crimes that seems needlessly complicated and invented mainly as a movie plot device, but here it works, mainly because Thornton throws himself into the role. That said, most of the humour is sophomoric, and the characters get annoying after a while. This movie really drags on a lot longer than it should.

I felt strangely unfulfilled after watching this, I guess I was expecting a laugh riot, as I am a fan of Billy Bob and Bernie Mac. Speaking of Bernie Mac, he seems to be slumming it in this film, like he just turned up for the paycheck. He is hardly in the film and when he is on screen he seems uninterested. A result of direction, perhaps? I really couldn't get behind (or as the yanks say 'root for') any of the characters. They are all useless. Billy Bob plays a great @$$#ole who rips off department stores once a year with his black midget buddy. Maybe I'm not supposed to take sides, but I wanted him to get busted.

Billy Bob has that charisma that great actors have, and the supporting cast - John Ritter, Bernie Mac, Billy-Bob's mini-partner in crime and Mrs. Santa's delectable sister all shine in quirky roles. And then there's the bizarre but enigmatic chubby youngster who latches on to BB, and provides a lot of the humour.I don't remember laughing out loud much, but you stay glued during the 90 minutes wondering what offensive, off-the-wall thing is going to happen next. Special mentions for the funny boxing ring scene, and bizarre minor cameo from Samir (of Office Space fame).Funny, quirky, strange - this film is all three, all the way through.

I have a dark sense of humor so be careful when you watch this film as it is quite dark. The combination of actions with Billy Bob Thortin and Bernie Mac is quite entertaining.

174,ks4,"Has some good and some slow moments, I didn't find it very funny though.",5,7 June 2004,"Bad SantaBilly Bob Thornton is a burn out man, acting as Santa only to secure a few heists from the supermarkets he's working at. His partner is a dwarf and as an ""Elf"" and ""Santa"" they have no problems getting work, but as ""Santa"" falls more and more apart the work is also getting harder. He hates life, but then he encounters a boy and a woman who is the waitress he's always dreamed of, and she has a thing for Santa's.Going into this movie i was unsure what to expect, in the later years I haven't found many movies funny, mostly because i find the humour plain dumb, movies often try to hard. Now this movie has an alternative way of using the humour, it's more raw and doesn't feel so ridicolous, instead it's almost interesting to watch how much the characters swear instead, there is never any doubt that the movie tries to bring humour from a different side than usual, and it does have some good moments. Just that overall it feels a little like it repeats it own jokes. I admit i had a few good laughs, but overall I don't think the movie is all that funny, and then the storyline just simply can't hold it together.The thing about the movie is, that even though it tries an alternative approach to the whole ""Santa story"", the movie is still very predicable, typical for these movies touched by the magic Hollywood formular you can feel the end all the way, it had a small twist in the end, that I admit surprised me, but the movie still managed to end the happy way I had expected and imagined. Naturally this doesn't have to mean that the movie has a bad storyline, it can still be interesting, warm, feeling and romantic or something else. And this movie did manage to keep me interested most of the way, during the second half there is a very slow moment where I almost dropped out, but through tht end it paced up a bit, saved itself.Besides Billy Bob Thornton, whom i found fantastic as this lowlife bum playing Santa, the crew is pretty standard. The directing is something I think every director with just a little experience could have pulled off, it has no marks, and actually I guess the director is responsible for slowing the movie down too much in the second half. There is never any doubt that this movie is dependant on Billy Bob, and it does lean much against him, and he gives a very fine performance too.To sum it all up a bit, I found this movie partly enjoyable, despite a lot of flaws and a story that has been told almost a million times, in many different ways now. It does bring an alternative way to do it, but in the end it all ends as usual. I got a good laughs, but overall the humour wasn't really me and couldn't carry the movie through, it had some good moments, and some bad moments, I reckon it's an average movie, that can be seen, but won't stay with you for long.

But I can certainly understand the problems its detractors had with it.First and foremost, the standout performances were from Billy Bob Thornton and The Kid. I actually was not ready for how touching The Kid was and I am willing to bet he takes a LOT of us back to those painful childhood instances that we would just as soon forget. But his performance is so moving and he finally does get his comeuppance but at an exorbitant price.To be sure, the vulgarity is overwhelming. And the actor playing his partner-in-crime, was entirely too bitter and twisted for his own good, so much so that you relished when Billy Bob cursed him out. There was certainly no emotional epiphany for him which made his character most one-dimensional.Bernie Mac and John Ritter were both wonderful. However, Cloris Leachman was horribly underused which is the biggest complaint I have with the movie. An actress of her stature and comedic talent should never have been relegated to where they just ""left"" her.But if you indeed possess one of those unorthodox senses of humor, you could definitely enjoy this film.

Never has a tagline been more accurate: this Santa really 'doesn't care if you're naughty or nice'. So ensure you keep kids away from this hilarious film  unless you're as sadistic as some of the characters.Billy Bob Thornton plays the most no-good, sad sack, permanently cussing, safe-cracking Santa ever envisioned. Accompanied by his partner in crime, a lippy materialistic dwarf, and his partner's partner  a trashy mail-order bride  it's a miracle this Santa gets so much 'tail'. Whoever knew that so many women were hot for Father Christmas? But when this wreck of a man encounters a slutty waitress (Gilmore Girls' Lauren Graham playing against type) and the unswerving loyalty of a fat, unprepossessing child (Brett Kelly), he undergoes a quasi-redemption.Bad Santa will have you laughing out loud, often from shock. Glen Ficarra and John Requa's pacy script injects some much-needed originality into the redemption formula and despite the unpleasantness of most of the characters, you begin to care about their tawdry lives.

179,canadude,wonderful,9,28 February 2004,"Whine whine whine and complain about this movie all you want. I think it's almost a paradigmatic example of brilliant black comedy. The movie doesn't have a single false note - it is dark and unsentimental through and through. It is also immensely heartwarming, though (what puts people off) in a way that is not conventional. I remember watching the scene where Santa is copulating with a barwoman he just met, in his dilapidated car, the woman begging him not to take the hat off because it's what turns her on, and thinking to myself ""wow, whatever children are present in their theatre are having their images of Santa raped by this film."" Literally five seconds later I see a woman getting up angrily, grabbing her kid by the arm and leaving the theatre. Her friend/relative followed with her kid. And the movie pokes fun at people like this: people who see the title ""Santa"" and assume it's a cuddly family-oriented story. No, it's a story about an alcoholic going through a middle-life crisis who also happens to have a black midget as a sidekick in his ""Santa Claus in a mall"" act. It is an assault on all sensibilities and niceties, but one done in good taste. Yes, it isn't for kids (especially those who deeply believe in Santa's good-natured soul) because it is about a certain lie that we perpetuate every Christmas season. It is about the sheer possibility that Christmas is not necessarily as perfect as we deem it to be and, in extension, neither is life. And, when I said that this movie doesn't strike a false note, I meant that it does settle for easy answers or solutions the characters' problems and dilemmas. It presents them honestly, with a naughty attitude that is refreshing in light of all the predictable, politically-correct crap out there. Not to mention, it's damn funny.",Bad Santa

It's a constant war between:Billy Bob Thorton as the alcoholic safe cracker mall santa who despises children and frequently pisses himself, swearing a blue streak and prowling the mall for sex with the customers.Then there's Tony Cox, a little person who is probably the best in the biz, playing the evil santa elf who masterminds mall robberies every year while pretending to be so nice to the kids and parents. His constant bitching at his inept partner is non-stop gut busting fun. Later, when he's thrown into the boxing ring with 'the kid' by Billy in order to teach him some moves, you will be rofling guaranteed.Then there's John Ritter, in one of his final roles. He plays the mall manager wet drip to perfection, playing the exact opposite of Jack Tripper better than he ever did Jack. His wincing face as his head of security (played to perfection by Bernie Mac) describes sexual activity of a dirty nature is comedic perfection.Bernie Mac is also at the top of his game, playing the corrupt sheriff head of mall security perfectly. He steals the scene when he confronts the diabolic duo of santa and elf in a local restaurant, demanding half in as many different tones of voice and accents as he can. See him call John Ritter's character 'Jack' in total deadpan. Priceless!Supporting roles are also nothing to ignore here.Lauren Graham is perfect as the boozy local bartender with a thing for guys in santa suits. Brett Kelly, in his first major role, is perfect as the fat picked on kid who can't stop asking stupid questions. Even Lauren Tom is awesome, as the cold selfish Asian mail order whore who prowls the mall before each heist sizing up the best brand items and listing her favourites for her little man husband.If you enjoy dark humour, billy bob at the top of his boozer game, and lots of fowl language, you will howl over this Christmas treat.",Bad Santa

Up there with the best Christmas movies ever, although definitely not kid-safe.The performances, by some marvelous scene-stealing actors, are wonderful, but in my book special note has to go to young Brett Kelly as The Kid (actually named Thurman Merman). The child is an ignored cipher, a fat, dumb, cherubic, perhaps mildly autistic blank slate of a personality who is also an incipient stalker. To all outward appearances he is repellent - rotund, snot nosed, dressed like a retard, blank-eyed and stupid - and he somehow develops into the emotional heart of the film. Compare him with Curly Sue and you can see just how far the filmmakers managed to diverge from the beaten path and still score emotional points. Kelly's scenes with arch scene-stealer Billy Bob Thornton, who manages to take a whiskey-sodden, self-hating loser and somehow turn him into a charismatic hero while not hiding an iota of his character's degradation, are gold. For whatever reason, the Kid is determined to bond with Thornton's thieving Santa (possibly due to the absence of anything representing adult authority in his life) and almost impossibly, Thornton's character responds. Enough cannot be said of the casting of this pair and their performances.They have competition from the other worthy members of the cast. Tony Cox is pitch-perfect as the scheming, evil midget elf trying to keep his safe-cracking Santa from going off the rails before the big payday on Christmas Eve. Bernie Mac as the corrupt, and crafty head of security who is on to them is also good. John Ritter is underused in his bit part, and Lauren Graham, although funny, seems to simply be there to provide whatever warped love interest there could be.The script is worth five stars and the direction, by underrated genius auteur Terry Zwigoff, is spot-on. Absolutely worth watching. Many times.",Bad Santa
185,HBeachBabe,just plain wrong,8,8 December 2003,"This film is just wrong in so many ways.  Every moment is more outrageous and offensive than the last.  And if you know what you are in for you will be rolling in the aisles with laughter, tears streaming down your face at how audaciously funny this film is.After sitting through the cute, predictable, sappy 'Elf' this film was 180. It's everything Elf and The Santa Clause weren't.  This is NOT a holiday film to spark good cheer and Christmas spirit and it definately isn't for children.It's crude, vulgar, offensive, mostly low-brow but smart about it.  This isn't 'There's Something About Mary/American Pie' sex-vulgar.  This is crude, mean people being crude and mean to each other.  People who criticize this as a vulgar film had no business going to see it.  If you want anything other than the most offensive Santa movie ever, stay away!If foul language and sex doesn't bother you, than you will probably enjoy this one.  Just be prepared - it's like nothing you've seen before.",Bad Santa
186,tresdodge,Hilarious a great great movie,10,18 November 2004,"An alcoholic con man Willie(Billy Bob Thornton) and his midget sidekick (Tony Cox)pose as Santa and his little helper for the children every year in a different mall. However, they do this, not out of love but in order to suss out the place and rob the mall safe every Christmas Eve. Along the way Willie meets a rather fat and bullied child which begins to complicate matters. I thought this movie was incredible from start to finish, it was utterly hilarious with Billy Bob Thornton putting in a magic performance. The script was the funniest in a long long time, the acting brilliant and the child (Brett Kelly) did a super job.I really can't recommend this enough, I'm going to see this again and recommend it to everyone I know.",Bad Santa
187,jmcgee-1,One of the FUNNIEST damn film of ALL TIME!,10,28 December 2003,"This film is one of my favorite films of all time.It's so funny it's hard not to laugh at Billy Bob & the kid every time they get shown.This one of my the greatest holiday films of all time.It's right up there with Christmas Vacation & Trapped in Pradise.This film makes me want to love Santa Clause more.It was also a hoot to see John Ritter again.Making this his last film,he will not be forgotten.Tony Cox,Santa's little helper,has always been funny.And seeing him in this showed his talent more.He'll be gitting alot movie buzz after this.And Berine Mac is just Berine Mac except with bad teeth in this flick.So Bad Santa is Badily Funny.I also wanted Billy to win for best actor in a comedy at the golden globes,but he's going up against Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean.    The next holiday film to wait for like this is a comedy/horror called Santa's Slay.It's about Santa,who is really the Devil after losing a bet with an angel,time has expire.So now it's time for the Devil to go back to his evil ways.And gives gifts that really brings the theme...""It'll really kill the kids"",to life.",Bad Santa
188,denzil-09434,One of the very best film comedies,9,26 December 2018,"Everything about this movie is much better than probably any other film comedy. Never mind other Christmas movies. The cast is superb. Writing and direction are phenomenal.Every character is so beautifully observed that a movie about just that one character would be better than most movies. It goes without saying that Billy Bob Thornton is brilliant but every supporting character is also perfectly cast, performed and directed.I watch this movie at least annually and every viewing makes me laugh more than the last. This year it was the head of mall security and his constant consumption of oranges, cigarettes and fibrocell stool softener during meetings which tickled me the most. It's deliciously absurd, funny and touching too.",Bad Santa

For the record, I agree that this movie is 100% NOT for kids and is very appropriately rated.  However, for adults, this is a pretty good film.There is ample humor and a decent story.  The acting is terrific, especially from Billy Bob Thornton and the guy playing the elf.  The kid who played the main child (I won't say the name because it is a joke in the movie) also did really good.This is NOT an oscar movie or something that will be the classics list. But I was not expecting that and actually had low expectations based on some critic reviews I had read.  They were wrong.  The bottom line is that this was a movie that I don't feel was a waste of my time or money.  It entertained me and that is what really counts in my opinion.  I rated it 8 out of 10.",Bad Santa

191,ofjeworstlust,Only high-rated because of the setting,2,2 January 2005,"Oh come on, those comments about it being a Christmas movie or Home Alone-for-adults are way beyond the truth.After 60 minutes the movie gets acceptable, but before it ends up there you've got a mix of the following. F-word, S-word, booze, cigarettes and a nice girl.Story line? Thinner than Home Alone 5 if there would be one. Don't fall for the high rating as the moment I write this (7.2) because I get annoyed by this movie.I liked Harold & Kumar and their White Castle, any regular X-mas movie and am not prude, but this simply is not funny at all!",Bad Santa
192,Q-Man,"Very funny Christmas Film, maybe not for kids",8,23 December 2004,"I read several reviews of ""Bad Santa"" before seeing it. Most just expounded upon how offensive it was. I was actually somewhat hesitant to rent it, because I typically don't like films that are crude just for the sake of being crude. I rented ""Badder Santa"", the unrated version. Yes, there is a lot of use of the ""f"" word, but this movie is very entertaining and actually has the traditional ""redemption"" theme found in so many other Christmas movies. Bad Santa was certainly not traditional, but it was a well told story that moved along in a brisk and entertaining manner. The cast was great. I read one review expressing the opinion that Santa would be better played by Jack Nicholson. I couldn't disagree more. Billy Bob Thornton was the perfect combination of dissipated disillusionment and charm. Brett Kelly who plays the kid who befriended him was exactly right for the part and a good actor as well. Tony Cox, John Ritter, and Bernie Mac were all hilarious. I do agree that Cloris Leachman was wasted in her role. She is extremely talented and didn't have much to do in this film. I would recommend this movie to most people, although not younger children. The type of humor I don't like is that which depends on cruelty to supposedly be funny. The humor in this film was never cruel, a little rude, but not cruel. Ignore the bad reviews and rent this movie, it is well worth it.",Bad Santa
193,drunken_critic,Down and Out,8,3 April 2005,"The theme of this movie is ""down and out"". Billy Bob Thorton plays a criminal alcoholic named Willie whose life is pure crap. I like the idea of watching someone throw his life away. What confuses me is his intentional self-destruction. His life is really not that bad. He is actually successful at what he does. Every Christmas he plays a department store Santa Claus, and on Christmas Eve he and his sidekick midget rob the store. He picks the safe, and escapes with $100's of thousands of dollars. He also has a hot groupie that has a Santa fetish.Why is he on such a self-destructive path? He keeps mentioning his father's abuse, so I guess he is looking at the past. In reality his present is not that bad. Overall this was a good look at a person haunted by his past that cannot live in the present because of haunting memories. I have known people like this in real life. They would keep dwelling on the past. Usually it was woe is me ""my daddy didn't pay attention to me"". I could never comprehend how past memories can play such an impact on behavior. However, I came from a good household. I was not abused or neglected, so I will never know. Anyway, his behavior is the main root of his problems, and it causes an environmental surrounding and circumstance of his life. His surrounding and circumstances do not cause problems. This is a very important distinction of self-destruction. The cause and effect relationship usually is based on environmental surrounding altering behavior, but a self-destructive person's cause and effect is the opposite. The self-destructive cause is the behavior and the effect is the surrounding or circumstance.One of the best movies I have ever seen that deals with self-destruction is ""Barfly"". Barfly makes this movie seem like a weekend holiday. I think Barfly was better because it looked at self-destruction seriously. Bad Santa was more of a dark comedy, and the movie kept showing a glimpse of escape. I kept thinking that Willie's life is not that bad. I thought that Willie could at any time realize this and change his outlook on life. I was waiting for the happy ending, and I got it.I like the idea of movies exploring self-destruction. A good movie theme is what causes it and how can it be changed. This movie did not really explore that topic. It presented it in a comedic fashion. I guess if it were serious it would just have been another ""Leaving Las Vegas"". 80/100",Bad Santa
194,proffate,Astonishingly unfunny,2,26 August 2004,"For one who considers Used Cars and Blazing saddles among the funniest movies he's ever seen, the threat of ""tastelessness"" that appeared in some reviews was no deterrent. The buzz was that Bad Santa was funny, and that's all that I was looking for.It wasn't. Watching on DVD, it's possible to consult the time code. I smiled 45 minutes into the movie and laughed once a little over a minute into it. That's it. One laugh in 98 minutes (unrated version). Did they edit the laughs out of the theatrical release?I'm reminded of a film historian (Halliwell, I believe) who watched a series of Mack Sennett shorts and wondered how anyone, ever, had found them funny. I'm with him.The fact that so many critics called the film hilarious says more about the wretched state of film criticism than about the movie. What amused erudite critics that we poor mortals in the hinterlands fail to grasp? Was it the anti-religious element that's so trendy in today's Hollywood?
""Smash the heads off Mary and Joseph in a manger scene and get a laugh!"" That's it? That's what humor has been reduced to nowadays, at least according to the ordained elite? If so, the critics must be rejected, shunned, and, if necessary, restricted to leper-like colonies where they can mingle with their own kind without risk of infecting the rest of society.",Bad Santa
195,philip-1,Execrable,1,6 December 2003,"Bad Santa is easily the worst movie I have spent money to see. And that's not hyperbole! I like black comedies and went after it received lots of positive reviews from critics all over the country.Well, I don't need to tell you that a majority of the our critics here in the USA don't have a clue!!!  Bad Santa is a one note, foul mouthed, boring waste of time.  The plot is paper thin and there is not one character who is in the least bit funny or even mildly amusing.  Every character in this movie is a LOSER from Billy Bob to the pudgy, angel faced kid that bugs him. After a half hour with these people, you want to escape the prison; I mean the theater.I saw the movie in Cleveland.  There were a few titters at some of the bad language.  The big audience laugh came when several of the characters get successively kicked in the groin. Is that gag as old as the hills??? Otherwise, the crowd was comatose; probably in the same state of shock that I was in.Why any department store management would retain a Santa that doesn't wear his beard correctly, isn't in a fat suit, pisses in his pants, is constantly drunk and swears in the presence of the children, is beyond my comprehension.  Are we that stupid in the United States?
By the end, you care not a whit for any of the characters; you don't feel good about the holiday season; you beat on yourself for having been duped into spending money on this trash; and you wonder what's become of comedy in American movies!By the way, the movie is dedicated to the memory of John Ritter!!! It is not a fitting tribute; rather an embarrassment to his legacy.  I'm sure he'd have been appalled!",Bad Santa
196,benc7ca,Just F****IN Hilarious!,8,2 July 2004,"As manically demented as the road gets, this marvellously insane, foulmouthed movie leads to a very American, very heart-warming, affirmation of family, even if it is one constructed out of the bits and pieces of some VERY damaged people. Billy Bob Thornton aces the role as madman Santa( with all the publicity surrounding his hard-living ways, I wonder where he begins and the character ends). John Ritter, in his last film performance, is very good as the bewildered store manager. Tony Cox, Lauren Graham and even Bernie Mac are terrific in this cast of characters one never hopes to meet. Cloris Leachman plays the almost-dead grandma with total conviction (LOL). Special congratulations to Brett Kelly who plays `The Kid'; he delivers his lines in the dead-speak of a true victim who keeps on hoping something good will happen and, finally, it does.  I plan to add this one to my list of `Holiday Favourites'.",Bad Santa
197,tfc,Stuck between a dark comedy and a tragic travesty.,7,13 August 2004,"Bad Santa (2003) I would consider a movie of interest. This means you have to look past the plot  and just look at the whole ethos of the film. It is rated `R' for several good reasons so do not take kids to see this movie, it is for adults who can understand dysfunctional people. Again, do not let kids watch this film because it portrays toxic people not at their best. The plot is funny in that Santa and his elf are thieves that knock over stores during Christmas and one can laugh at the dark comedy theme. The tragedy comes from the fact that every person and institution is totally screwed up and/or is malevolent and the interaction of these factors are very disturbing. The character of Santa is a totally dysfunctional antihero and sadly ends up the `winner' (loses the least) at the end. The rest of the cast are dysfunctional in there own special way and end up losing in the end. The fact that the slow fat kid can now protect himself may make him less of a loser but he's not really a winner. Other movies that share the same feel of `Bad Santa' are `The Man Who Wasn't There,' `Fargo' and ` A Clockwork Orange' which are all good movies. I would give Bad Santa a 7.5/10 for the tragedy, 6/10 for the comedy and 2/10 for language.",Bad Santa

Just about everbody else is going to split a gut laughing.I stole my summary line from Stephanie Zacharek's review in Salon - she loved this movie and so do I.

It really has no plot and what there is of a story is ambling, dull, and full of Hollywood cliches. It's funny in about 3 fleeting spots - that's it.

204,TheyKilledTheGiggler,"HILLARIOUS!!! Best holiday film since ""A Christmas Story""",10,27 November 2003,"Okay before I give you my review I must tell you my little story. The movie theater I saw ""Bad Santa"" at had a showing gap of 12:30 to 3:05. My friend and I missed an exit to the theater and got stuck in traffic disabling us from seeing the 12:30 showing. So we get to the theater around 1:10 and had to hang out in the theater for nearly 2 hours. (there were arcades but they all sucked) So I told my friend ""this movie better be good after all the time we've been waiting here!"" So after killing some time it was finally about time for the movie to start. (well coming attractions actually) After picking out which movies looked good from the many trailers, the movie finally started. So was it worth the long wait? HELL YES IT WAS!!! Bad Santa rocks!Synopsis (MINOR SPOILERS)The film stars Billy Bob Thorton and Tony Cox as a couple of con-men. Willie (Thorton) and Marcus (Cox) take jobs as Santa and his elf at malls every holiday season and rob the places blind before packing up and parting ways until the next year. During their latest job at a new mall the duo encounter a mall security guard (Bernie Mac) who becomes wise to them and wants in on their score. Also Willie meets two important people in his life. A Bartender named Sue (Lauren Graham) who has a sexual fetish for Santa Claus and a precious yet pathetic child (Brett Kelly) with an hillarious name, I won't say it because it's hillarious when you find out. Willie continues seeing Sue and ""moves in"" with the kid all the while fighting with his partner Marcus, who has become increasingly p***ed off by Willie's drunken behavior. Everything boils down to an exciting and unexpected climax.My Review: (Some Spoilers)Bad Santa is hillarious. Nuff' said! Dark Comedies are always the best kind. To me, nothing is funnier than a drunken sex-addicted mall Santa yelling at little kids and saying ""naughty stuff"" and who's partner is a fouled-mouth black midget. That is all that was needed to pull me into this movie. Add in Bernie Mac and the late great John Ritter (RIP)and you have instant comedy success! Every character plays their role perfectly. Seriously! The casting is genius. After seeing John Ritter as a mall owner who just wants to keep everything ""PG"" It really made me miss that man, he's a comic genius. I laughed uncontrollably everytime he told Bernie Mac why he had a problem with the new Santa. Anyways like I was saying, this movie is just flat out funny. The TV spots made it look really funny, but let me tell ya almost every scene in the TV spots is edited and they are 10 times more hillarious in the actual movie. I could probably go on and on about how great this movie is but you should already know. I think we need more Holiday comedies like Bad Santa and A Christmas Story. Enough of this Home Alone ""family is the truest gift of all"" crap. We need more movies where things don't turn out as expected, where people only care about presents, and where nothing is off limits. Bad Santa and A Christmas Story live up to those guidelines. Nobody wants to see losers who are just happy to be with their families on Christmas, we (or at least just me) want to see Santa banging chics in the big and tall dressing room, Santa kicking the S*it out of a plastic reindeer as children look on with fear in their eyes, and Santa telling an 8 yr old he's not living with Mrs. Claus because he got caught screwing his sister!10/10 SEE IT NOW!!!!",Bad Santa
205,soulcharmer,"Actually, good Santa",9,7 July 2004,"After seeing absolutely amazing ten-star Ghost World I looked forward this new instalment of Terry Zwigoff. First important thing is that Bad Santa is another genre, hence the unrealistic plot. Second important thing is that the ultimate sarcasm and cynicism we've seen before is there once more. Third important thing is that the acting is close to flawless and the movie isn't boring even when no funny thing is happening. Fourth important thing is that there actually is a strong moral coming from this movie, no matter what those who didn't like the flick say.And that's about it. Comedies are not among my favorite genres because I rarely come upon truly intelligent and well-performed one. But I truly enjoyed this exception. And I tell you, the f word is like a very good spice in this movie - you won't consume it alone but you wouldn't like the meal that much without it... Sometimes I think the only result of keeping the kids from the f word-harm's way are the individuals who can't enjoy movies like this, because they are sooo rude and crude and blah, blah, blah to them.

206,baconballs1969,Pointless,3,19 March 2006,"What is the point of this film? All it appeared to be to me was an excuse for bad language and sex. What really offended me was the amount of blasphemous comments - is it really necessary to take the Lord's name in vain as much as they did in this movie, it particularly sickened me.Apart from this, there were a few laughs in the film - I liked the fat kid and the development of his relationship with BB Thornton was rather touching.When I hired this movie I expected a serious heist kind of movie, but there was very little plot to the whole thing and the odd robbery which was pulled off just seemed to be a side-line to the whole thing.BB Thornton played a good drunk, but basically that is all that the film is about - a man dressed as Santa, constantly intoxicated, mouthing obscenties.I was quite disappointed with this and will definitely NOT be adding this to my DVD collection.BB Thornton is worthy of much better than this pile of crap.",Bad Santa
207,TonysLittleFriend,It jingled my bells!!!,8,22 September 2004,"Forget that Yuletide spirit. And whatever you do please prevent all those impressionable little tikes from meeting the ""real"" St. Nick up close and personal in Bad Santa, a droll, dry and thoroughly refreshing black comedy from the warped minds of those own demented souls, the Coen Brothers.Savvy studio Miramax joins forces with Alliance Atlantis Releasing to again take a chance on controversial subject matter bound to ruffle the feathers of more than a few churchgoers. Comedy enthusiasts, however, are sure to lap up this pox on holiday rituals now unfolding at The Park, The Granville Seven, and select Famous Players cites.Picture a down on his luck Santa and you have fertile ground for comedy growth. Our Santa under the white beard goes by the name of Willie T. Soke. Unshaven, unkempt and definitely not a model Santa, this Mr. Claus goes mall hopping with a friendly three foot dwarf. Don't let outer appearances fool you. Underneath that entire festive red robe lies a vulgar man of war more interested in drinking himself silly than caring for the kids. From town to town, state-to-state go Mr. Soke and his elf-like friend until they emerge in Phoenix. Known for its conservative lifestyle, the men of Christmas set up shop in an upscale mall run by a very religious manager. Almost immediately Mr. Soke gets into the drinking, the swearing and the vulgarity, frequently getting it on with any sweet young thing to cross his path. So upset is the manager with their festive child greeter that the chief of store security is called in to investigate before things go from bad to worse - if that's at all possible.Outside of store hours this wicked Santa manages to hook up with a homely woman named Sue and accidentally runs into an overweight boy who forms a focal part of the storyline. This child, known as the kid, is a victim of bullying and against all odds this unconventional larger than life clown actor somehow forms a bond with this boy.Sarcasm, love, comedy and all kinds of craziness are expected in Bad Santa. Billy Bob Thronton gives what I believe to be the greatest Santa performance of all time. Actually, Thronton admits he was drunk through a good portion the film while filming it. I just thought he took the role seriously, now apparently he took it a little too seriously. Playing Thornton's crime buddy, Tony Cox gives a hilarious performance. Midgets seem to always bring out the worst in people. I don't mean to offend anyone. The first time I saw him was in the ever so awful, ""Me, Myself and Irene"". I thought that was the funniest part in the film, and I wanted to see him get an even bigger role in a comedy. Then there was Bad Santa, and he does a great job.The ever so hot Lauren Graham plays Mrs. Santa, lol. And Brett Kelly plays the film's odjob, Thurman Murman. The kid. Ever performance seems to be perfect. But the best I'd have to say is the grandma. Or least her lines. ""ROGER! Your home! Let me fix you some sandwiches"". I laugh so hard during those scenes, just like the whole. It's hilarious.Not only is Bad Santa my favorite comedy, but also my favorite holiday movie. One of my all time favorite films. Charming, witty, and downright crude. I love it. I don't even need to watch the movie to watch the movie. What I mean is I can watch it in my head pretty much. I've seen it so many times. A classic comedy/Christmas flick!****/*****",Bad Santa
208,TrickTaylor,Edited version better?,6,20 February 2007,"I saw an edited for TV version of this film last week. Pointless to comment on a TV version of a three year old movie? Maybe. Based on the comments here, it could be that the edited version better allows the viewer to catch the character development in Bad Santa.The plot points have been well documented here. The setting and scenario are a bit unrealistic, even for a way out comedy. I kept thinking, why don't these guys get caught and why would any mall hire a scrawny drunk Santa? Suspension of disbelief does not always work. Actually, the film leads the viewer to many of these questions. Why would a hot waitress gravitate towards such a dirt bag? Can a man actually drink that much? When is child welfare going to be called? Billy Bob's performance is quite good, but is handcuffed by the narrow way we are asked to see Willie. It lapses in cartoonish way too often for us to believe that an actual transformation has happened. Marcus is a great character, but I would have liked to see more for him as well.Ultimately I feel the filmmakers cheaply tried to push the envelope instead of actually going all the way with this movie. Swearing is not stunning after the first 50 F-bombs. You could see the story line with the kid coming a mile away. You hoped it would truly be a movie for adults, but it shied away at the last second, becoming just another neutered R-rated comedy with swearing.To fix this movie I would have built more on the characters around Willie and Marcus. Make it a true ensemble piece. Don't have Willie turn soft. Rather, have the kid and the waitress team up to bring him down. Soften up on the F-bombs and write in cutting humor focusing on everything the characters are exhibiting.Bad Santa is a fun movie to watch once. Some great laughs, but lacking in a true identity.",Bad Santa

From the moment this movie hits the screen until the end, you are exposed to a wry presentation of the dark side of Christmas.Every character is a loser.  Santa's a loser, the Elf is a loser, even the store managers are losers.There is a glimmer of hope however, and how that glimmer surfaces in this film is a trip worth taking.  It is funny, and crude, and like all good movies, it has a grain of truth within it.  This movie is the antithesis of ""It's a Wonderful Life"", and as such may well take its place as a holiday classic.",Bad Santa

213,azcoppen,Darker than you think,5,18 January 2009,"I think i was expecting the mood of this film to be very different. With a name like ""Bad Santa: it implies a very tongue-in-cheek and rude comedy that is the antithesis of childish innocence. But it's actually a very dark and sad film - more of a tragedy than a comedy. Don't get me wrong, it has some hilarious moments that have you howling (""you won't s**t right for a week"" comes to mind), but this is also a flick where Santa has chronic depression and is almost beyond hope or help. Seeing the man in a car with the exhaust pipe stuck in the window isn't a laugh-out-loud moment. It's actually incredibly sad.The lead character really is absolutely miserable in every way - rude, self-adsorbed, mean, selfish, uncaring, and just downright horrid. The guy in himself doesn't understand humour and never cracks a smile, which is what gives it it's dark humour. The fact he is accompanied by a retarded child and mental dwarf is a brilliant juxtaposition that lifts it from a very dark place to something more. The dwarf's abuse is outrageously funny, especially when he's cussing the black cop attempting to exploit them.If you want to feel better about your life by pitying someone else, this would be the movie for you; if you want silly stupidity you need a spoof; but if you want what the name implies, you may just be slightly disappointed.",Bad Santa

But beware cause this an utterly politically incorrect black comedy. Billy Bob Thornton is absolutely brilliant as Bad Santa and even got a Golden Globe Nomination for his performance. Even winning an Oscar wouldn't have been a surprise. The story goes as follows: ""A miserable conman and his dwarf partner pose as Santa and his Little Helper to rob department stores on Christmas Eve. But they run into problems when the conman befriends a troubled kid."" Wtf, even the fat blond kid plays perfectly!

The grandparents would most likely be offended by the language and the content. The kids should not see it either unless they are 13 or older and see it with their parents. But if you are an adult and appreciate a dark comedy you will probably like this film if the language doesn't offend you. I laughed out loud multiple times the first time I saw this film in the theater. Of course one of my favorite holiday films is Scrooged so take that into account. I also like It's a Wonderful Life too. Believe or not but there is something about Bad Santa that presents a good message in a rather twisted manner. Billy Bob is great in the title role as Willie. Tony Cox, Bernie Mac, John Ritter, and Lauren Graham all give wonderful performances. But it maybe the performance of Brett Kelly as the kid that makes this movie work. He is so innocent that he balances Billy Bob's crudeness and eventually helps Willie realize a purpose for his life. In that sense it has something in common with Scrooged and It's a Wonderful Life. It even kind of makes a swipe at Forest Gump in the advent calender and gives rise to one of the best lines in the movie for Willie.

216,Johnny0581,a raunch fest with a heart,7,4 March 2005,"I know this movie might seem trashy to most people who are used to conventional and family-friendly Christmas flicks like Jingle all the Way, The Santa Clause, Miracle on 34th street, Home Alone, blah, blah, blah, but I've got some news for you. This is a Christmas flick for GROWNUPS only. Yes it's rude, lewd, vulgar, that's the whole point. But Billy Bob Thornton and Tony Cox (Who most people remember as the black midget from Me, Myself and Irene) are hysterical! They see Christmas from a whole 'nother perspective as the average citizen. They see it as an opportunity to score the biggest heist of the year. Billy Bob's Willie is an expert vault-opener, who is a complete mess as a human being. He's rude, crude, says the ""f"" word in every sentence, drinks excessively, and is a sex freak. and Marcus (the midget) is just a little bastard who also cusses excessively, but also takes advantage of his pint-sized body by sliding through small air vents, disguising as a baby, as a little snowman, etc. in order to make the whole heist work.When Willie and Marcus are on screen they are hilarious to watch, but then comes the little slow fat kid who Willie refers to in the whole movie as simply ""Kid"", he is funny as well and make's Willie even more hilarious by getting on his everlasting nerve with every single annoying ass question that pops into his head. Willie and Marcus' level of cuss words might be too strong for some viewers, but makes the movie even more hilarious, especially when Willie goes off at the kid, who sometimes, deserves it. Bernie Mac in the role of the villain, plays the head of security of the Mall Willie and Marcus intend to rob, he does a decent job playing the bad guy for a change, but nothing special. John Ritter as the clueless mall manager is hilarious in this movie and will be missed for years to come. The hot bartender girl, the chick from Gilmore Girls is very sexy in this movie. Despite all the smut in the movie, it is touching in the end and it sends out a good message for people who are insecure and passive, in other words people who go around taking other people's crap.The movie is not exceptional but is a good comedy if you're in the mood for raunchy humor. 7 out of 10",Bad Santa
217,cineastFGD,American vulgarity at its finest - plain dumb and not funny at all,1,12 December 2020,"This film is a strong contender for the most boring flick I've ever seen. Never mind that the plot line is basically absent, never mind that the acting is mediocre at best, at least this movie contains not a single joke worth laughing about, nor a scene that would in the least contain some glimpse of humour (even my 13 year old son didn't laugh a single time - and this means something).The plot is as flat as the nonexistent jokes - guy in Santa costume (or without) gets drunk, swears at everything and everybody, pukes and pees himself, and passes out. Sometimes - fully inexplicably - he gets laid by a beautiful woman in a public place (what woman would touch such a disgusting train wreck?). There you have it, full stop, that's it.So unless you are a 15 year old school yard bully living in a trailer park and with one too many beers and some joints in your system (of which there seem to be quite a number, judging by the other reviews), make a detour and use your 10 bucks on something else. A tour to the nearest homeless shelter would deliver you the essence of this movie for free.Wish I could get my money and especially my time back for this one.",Bad Santa
218,RDenial,Sorry excuse for a movie,1,19 July 2004,"What is sad is that the premise of this film had potential. I like dark humor and that is why I rented it. The thought of a Bad Santa, perhaps like the Santa in ""A Christmas Story"" is a funny idea. What we get instead is Billy Bob Thornton playing an foul mouthed alcoholic sex pervert, which is the same role we have seen him play in dozens of other films. According to his ex-wife, he is not acting! He makes no attempt to be a Santa, just sitting there in a drunken stupor with his beard off saying vulgar things to children while wetting his pants. The idea that he could be hired to be a Mall Santa is absurd. I think the ""F"" word was said more times in this film than in ""Serpico"" and ""Scarface"" put together. Yet the idea of all these dysfunctional people finding redemption is a timeless one, and in other hands could have become a Holiday Classic. The little boy in the film in particular impressed me. You do not see kids this naive today and he very well could have been right at home in the ""Our Gang"" comedies of 70 years ago, which the director had hoped to find as he sent them looking for a ""Joe Cobb"" type. I can only hope the kid was not damaged for life at all the vulgarity that he was exposed to.The question remains ""just who did they make this film for?"" It is certainly not a film you would want your kids to see, yet, the themes of a broken man just needing love is the stuff of family films. Really I do not believe that much thought went into making this film. I think someone thought the idea of a drunken Santa talking vulgar was funny, so they made a script around that. If that is your idea of humor, then this is your film.",Bad Santa
219,stamp1,This movie made me sad and depressed.,1,10 December 2003,"This movie made me feel sad and depressed. They abuse a retarded boy and it isn't funny at all. This movie was made for mean people who laugh at the misery of others, who think the sicker and grosser it is, then it must be funny (it wasn't). People who liked it have no heart or sympathy for others. They were the bullies in school who picked on the kids who were different, nerdy, not popular, fat, gay, or ugly. That is why the boy in this movie is beaten up and teased and abused, and told how stupid and ugly he is, because he IS fat, ugly, and seems to be retarded. Of course, he has no friends or parents, and no one loves him, although Billy Bob Thornton does seem to pity him at the end of the film. I felt like crying for this poor abused little boy. Some Xmas movie! :(Movie Philosophy: Gross out everyone, be really disgusting. Pick on lonely people and make fun of them (which is everyone in the movie pretty much, including Billy Bob Thornton's role). Show how people are wicked and evil and disgusting, and laugh at their misfortunes. Put it out for the Xmas Holidays, so anyone with a heart will feel sad and blue for Christmas.

Why oh why are we being influxed with so many of these kinds of movies with juvenile humour? I can laugh at a lot of things but after the first 2 or 3 references to bodily functions it isn't funny anymore but you just know you're going to hear the same basic joke 10 more times before the movie is over and it wasn't even really that funny the first time. And I think i've seen the kid-who-pees-on-the-department-store-santa scene enough times, thank you very much.

I'm guessing that half of the words from Willy's mouth were profane. Billy Bob Thornton's talents were definitely wasted in this film. Two, the storyline was weak. It was just too unbelievable and goofy. There was potential there for a much better plot. And, three, was it necessary to show all the nudity and the fornicating?

Bad Santa reviews and TV promo clips looked like it would be an amusing film she might enjoy.  When a lady called a Los Angeles radio talk show saying, ""I am a conservative and a prude, and this movie was full of swearing and vulgarity, and I never laughed so hard.  I went back to see it again two days later!""; I thought we might enjoy a few laughs as well.  We didn't.  Film makers seem to be vying to make the most disgusting films possible, and here they have succeeded in coming close to the bottom.  Once again, my wife and I wasted an evening.  The very few slightly amusing moments hardly made up for the remaining trash.  Cloris Leachman was totally wasted in a role where she laid back, mouth wide open, semi-comatose virtually in every one of her scenes.  A waste of a talented actress.

226,El_Guapo9,"""Let me fix you some sandwiches""",7,2 August 2004,"""Bad Santa"" is a rare film that can take a magical occasion for so many people, namely Christmas, and turn it into a depressing, shocking and utterly fascinating hour and a half movie.  The film has so many great comedic moments that I can't even begin to list them all.  Just the idea of having a mall Santa who goes from town to town with his partner (an elf), poses for the entire holiday season and eventually robs the places blind is a brilliant one.Willie Soke (Billy Bob Thornton) is a mall Santa who is everything you would expect Santa not to be.  Willie is a terrible person who shows up to work routinely drunk, has sex in the front seat of his car (and the plus-size ladies' dressing rooms) with his Santa suit still on, yells and swears at the kids that come to see him and (to top it all off) is a criminal.  Sure Willie had dreams and still does, but it seems knocking off malls every holiday season provides just enough money for him to get by.When he and his dwarf accomplice Marcus (Tony Cox) show up in Phoenix, Willie is befriended by a child with seemingly no friends (it can't be easy to make friends when your name is Therman Merman).  Therman adores this Santa, and since he is home alone with only his seemingly sedated Grandma watching him, it isn't long before Willie has moved from his hotel to the Merman house.John Ritter is great as the mall manager who wants to get the newly-hired Willie out of his mall after noticing just how awful of a person he is. Bernie Mac is also excellent as the head of mall security who isn't exactly on the level, either.After befriending Therman (even though Willie doesn't know his name through almost the entire movie) Willie starts to soften up just a little.  In the end he's still the same bitter mall Santa criminal, but he opens up a smidge to the kid and shows that anybody can have a little bit of nice in them, especially on Christmas.7 out of 10.",Bad Santa

Billy Bob Thorton plays a safe cracking, drunk Lathario with a taste for anal sex, that masquerades as a Department Store Santa every year just so he can steal the stores money.  Tony Cox plays his sick foul mouthed dispicable little elf (more like a troll really) that is his sidekick and partner in crime.  John Ritter plays the uptight repressed department store manager that hired these two.  Bernie Mac plays a bad wicked little store detective that is on to the two crooks.  The lovely Lauren Graham plays a hot bartender that has the the hots for Santa, and quite frankly made me want to dress up in a Santa suit again.  Finally the saving grace of this sick little movie is the fat kid, I don't know his name but he was fantastic as the pathetic little one that Billy Bob plays pitty on.  In this kid Billy Bob finds some redemption and that says a lot since this maybe the most unredeemable charecter in recent movie history.

228,witness-7,The Citizen Kane of Alcoholic Santa movies,7,3 January 2004,"Bad Santa is a funny movie with equal parts drama, but that's just one person's opinion.To appreciate it, you have to have a cynical streak about the level of smarm in holiday movies. And like the movie ""Waiting for Guffman"" (which I hated -- a major exception for me to Christopher Guest movies), it's a one-joke movie. If that joke (an abusive, alcoholic Santa) doesn't work for you, it's going to be a really long, lame movie with characters you could care less about.Oddly enough, the one movie that came to mind upon viewing this was the much-ignored (and deservedly maligned) 1992 classic, ""Shakes the Clown"" -- a movie which billed itself as ""The Citizen Kane of Alcoholic Clown movies"".

Bad Santa just isn't funny. The story itself is decent enough, but the execution of this movie is simply awful. Thornton's Willie/Santa is such a shallow character that when he does, at long last, start to have some empathy for his young host, the change comes out of nowhere. His dialogue is tired and lame. The other characters are just as bad, and considering that they're played by the normally excellent Bernie Mac, Ajay Naidu, John Ritter, and Tony Cox, the fault could only lie with the director. There's no other way a movie could suck the life out of so much great talent.If Bad Santa worked on its own merits, then Santa's intense profanity would fit his character.

This movie is brave and bold. It's unlike any other Christmas movie out there. It's not a sweet story of the spirit of Christmas. But a dark twisted comedy about a man who is broken and the despicable things he does. Hollywood rarely makes movies like this. Of course when you have a movie that is so different the studio will be concerned about how the film will do. In Bad Santa's case the producers went back and filmed additional scenes to make the movie more mainstream. As for which cut you should see If you want a good comedy See The theatrical cut.If you want a complex character study see the director's cut. In the lead role, we have Billy Bob Thornton, who does an excellent job, he brings the right level of patheticness to the character. As his sidekick, we have Tony Cox (Spaceballs, ""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi, Beetlejuice) He has good timing and the acting is solid . The kid is played by Brett Kelly who does a great job for a child actor. Marcus(the sidekick)'s wife is played by Futurama 's Lauren Tom, and she does a good job. Lauren Graham plays the love interest and she is good. But she has a pretty small role. Comedian Bernie Mac and veteran actor John Ritter also have supporting roles. This is in fact John Ritter's last live action role Also, keep an eye out for a famous actress of old age and Lois Griffin's voice Alex Borstein. But the real star here is the script written by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa and rewritten by the movie's director Terry Zwigoff and the Coen Brothers. It's smart and does not talk down to the audience. And it is also fresh.It is not something that has never been done before. More something that is not done very often.

As for Billy Bob Thorton, it's another one of his standard performances, great if you like him, some as always if you feel neutral about him. Personally, I wouldn't call this movie much of a comedy.",Bad Santa
240,intothebluegreatness,"""Wanna play again?""",10,21 May 2008,"I could sew the producers of Bad Santa as they completely busted my gut.When you're about ten seconds in to the movie, you are basically warned about what you're in for: a crude, funny as hell movie about Christmas, and a drunk who works as a mall Santa for the holidays. Billy Bob Thorton is an absolute genius in this movie. After the flick is over, you may find yourself asking ""how did he do that."" Yes, Billy Bob Thorton is that good in this film. He absolutely grabs your laugh box from the very beginning, and shakes it for the next 98 minutes.However, this isn't all that Bad Santa is about. There are some feel good moments, like when Billy Bob Thorton becomes attached to the ""kid."" Bad Santa is funny almost all the time, seemingly without even trying. For example, When the kid even says his own name it is funny. ""Thurman Murman."" I laughed so hard at that one scene, which I don't think was even meant to be funny. Bad Santa obviously isn't for people with a huge Christmas spirit, but it is still such a great comedy.One of the funniest films EVER made, without a doubt.",Bad Santa

There are two funny lines, and if you've seen any of the trailers, you've already heard them both. The rest of this movie is misogynist, crude, depressing, and about as unfunny as unfunny gets. It's the Seinfeld of unfunny. Billy Bob Thornton plays a disgusting drunk who should not be allowed near your food, much less your children. The idea that any mall executive would be stupid enough to hire this misanthrope to talk to children simply because his friend is a midget is ludicrous. (Is this the only midget in Phoenix?) Christmas is a great time to do good deeds for your fellow human beings. If I convince just one of you to avoid this stinker and spend your money on egg nog instead, I've done my good deed for the Christmas season.

243,johnnybravo19852000,Did Santa just say the F word? ***1/2 out of ****,7,14 July 2004,"When I was just a lad, my father told me that Santa Clause is a dirty old man. Our family did not celebrate Christmas and the only holiday movie I ever saw was The Scrooge.Well times change and I did to so I was very reluctant to see this in the theater but after Bad Santa celebrated the holidays with $60 million of that green stuff and was also one of the best reviewed movies of 2003, I figured what the hell.Billy Bob Thornton gives a tour-de-force performance as the Santa Clause from hell. His character Willie is a washed up pathetic human being who when dead would probably be mourned by only the fleas on his back but he and his midget partner Marcus (played by Tony Cox who has the foulest mouth next to Al Pacino's character Tony Montana) have the perfect scam. Each Christmas they move from shopping malls all around the country to put on a ""show"" for the kiddies and then rob place after hours. The ""job"" pays a $100,000 a year but Willie decides later on that this is the last one.But eventually the money, the booze and the prostitutes are no longer a part of the everyday life so its time for another heist. Willie and Marcus head to California and are immediately hired by a dorky manager John Ritter (Bob Chepeska). Obviously the job of Santa is not hard to get since Willie is drunk during the interview.Ritter (who should have been given more airtime) starts to smell a rat but cannot convince the head of security (Bernie Mac) that Willie and Marcus are con men especially after Bob discovers Thornton giving anal sex to a woman in the dressing room. But later on we see that Mr. Mac isn't such a nice guy either.The major plot happens when Wille meets a little boy (Brett Kelly) who comes from a very dysfunctional family and is picked on by every bully in the neighborhood. Thornton is no nicer to the kid than anyone else, but when Willie needs a place to hide his new friend comes to the rescue. And the one scene you will be waiting for when Willie confronts the bullies is a treasure.The film contains some very funny and dark moments, but it all comes together and the ending should surprise you just like the Christmas presents you open up on December 25th.Warning to parents: Please take the R rating seriously. This film contains ushers of obscenities, strong sexual content and in one scene Willie is so intoxicated he falls over the Christmas props at the mall right in front of little kids who break out in tears. Of course I did too but I was laughing at the time.",Bad Santa

But otherwise a triumph. Billy Bob Thornton is anything but a jolly old elf: he's a messy, degenerate, dipsomaniac thief with a Machiavellian sawed-off sidekick. He has the foulest mouth this side of the North Pole and reserves his most sardonic lines for the unsuspecting kids unfortunate enough to reach his lap.Santa and his elf are in for a series of December adventures punctuated by 11-month tropical benders, and along the way he'll meet a repressed store manager, a hard-eyed store detective, a half-Jewish nymphomaniac and most memorably a Christmas angel in the form of 8-year old not-so-tiny-Tim, whose appearance, demeanor and story play with every sad-sack stereotype on the way to absolute redemption for all.Even if it's telegraphed and obvious, the second best line in the film is: ""Why do you need all this (stuff)? It's Christmas.""God bless us, everyone.",Bad Santa
245,guitarcarl,"Great, but not a holiday movie for the family",7,25 November 2006,"I recently watched this film for a second time. I forgot how good it really was. This is an adult movie loaded with sexual situations and adult language that also achieves so much more. The Language and sexual content purposed the greatest problems at the same time being almost essential to character and plot development. There is little new about the storyline really, a degraded selfish loser crosses path with a child and a women that over the Christmas holidays show him the error of his ways. Billy Bob Thornton is masterful in his portrayal of Willie, the loser. He leads an excellent cast that features a remarkable child actor, Brett Kelly, who plays ""the kid."" These two performances make the whole movie. Sadly, the language and sex cause this movie fall far short of its potential. ""Bad Santa"" could have easily become a Holiday Family Classic if it would have found a way to illustrate Willie's depraved state without resorting to such harsh elements. I'm not criticizing the language and sex of the film so much as commenting on how it placed its self so far out of the reach of what should have been its primary audience. Nobody, watches holiday movies like families do. So why make this movie like this? These actors were good enough to make any movie fantastic. I really enjoyed this one but so would have my wife and kids. There's little chance my wife would stay through it and no chance I, or her, would let the kids watch it. Hollywood took a left turn when they should have gone right and lost a lot of holiday box office and DVD sales for years to come. This could have been another ""Christmas Story"" but instead it's just for adults who don't mind movie with a lot of bad language and sex. If you're OK with that, I recommend it.",Bad Santa

Bad Santa (Billy Bob) is a bad man with bad habits and a bad attitude, but is he's got a good seasonal gig working with a mastermind thief who doubles as an elf.  The film is laced with a running stream of profanity and vulgar behavior.  Those parts were pretty good.The movie is overplayed for my taste.  The buffoonish portrayals of the major characters (except the late John Ritter, who actually was quite amusing) mask what could have been a brilliant dark comedy.  Even though I thought most of the movie was distasteful, there were two points in the movie where I laughed until my sides hurt.  i suspect the humor of the movie will ""touch"" people unevenly.  There was scattered laughter almost continuously among the audience, but few (if any times) when the majority seemed to agree on the amusement.This is movie to be seen.

247,mpdmartin,This is one Christmas film that can be enjoyed at any time of the year.,9,5 January 2016,"Bad Santa (2003) Reviewed by Martin Davis, Retrospect Film on Facebook 'Bad Santa' has been described variously as 'The nastiest Christmas film ever', 'The ultimate anti-Christmas film' or 'One of the best Christmas films ever'. In truth, it's much more than any of those descriptions. It's quite simply a great film, brilliantly scripted, and with assured direction from Terry Zwigoff, following on from 2001's excellent 'Ghost World'. With some exceptional performances, it's also very, very funny. The only person Willie T. Stokes (Billy Bob Thornton) hates more than anyone else is himself. Consumed with self loathing and drinking himself into oblivion, Willies' life and everyone in it are one endless series of disappointments. Unscrupulous and immoral, Willie is a bad person and he knows it. One thing he is good at though is cracking safes. Every Christmas with the help of his diminutive partner in crime, Marcus (Tony Cox) he finds work as a department store Santa Claus. With Marcus as his elf assistant, their sole intention is to rob the store on Christmas Eve. With Willie permanently drunk, abusive to the kids and having sex in the changing rooms, despite his best efforts, Marcus cannot avert the suspicions of store detective Gin Slagel (Bernie Mac). Slagel quickly brings his concerns to the attention of the mall manager Bob Chipeska (John Ritter), in his last film appearance. Meanwhile Willie is enjoying a passionate affair with Sue (Lauren Graham), a barmaid with a Santa Claus fetish. Things are further complicated by the unwelcome attention of a young boy, Thurman Merman, who believes the foul mouthed Willie to be the real Santa. Willie finally finds a purpose to his life, teaching Thurman to stand up to bullying after the youngster inadvertently saves him from suicide. With the clock ticking, will the Yuletide criminals be apprehended before they can complete their audacious robbery and will Willie find redemption in a childs innocence? Rude, crude and with the blackest of humour, 'Bad Santa' with a total of 300 profanities, may not be to everyones taste but it manages to be both hilarious and moving without once slipping into sentimentality. Both Jack Nicholson and Bill Murray showed interest in the title role but were already committed to other projects. It's difficult to imagine anyone other than Billy Bob Thornton as 'Bad Santa' though and he gives a career best performance, ironically losing out on a Golden Globe award to Murray for 'Lost in Translation'. This is one Christmas film that can be enjoyed at any time of the year. Excellent. Martin Davis, Retrospect Film on Facebook",Bad Santa
248,Raoul-16,Another Zwigoff tale of battered outsiders surviving,8,14 December 2003,"Minor Spoilers In direct contradiction to the comment of one writer here (that the film ""has no moral center""), I thought Bad Santa was intensely moral, though in an admittedly irreverent and politically incorrect way.  I also found the comments of another writer (that Willy's transformation by the end seems abrupt and unearned) to be off-base--plenty of hints are dropped throughout the film as Willy stumbles into his change of heart.  I also disagree with the various comments made here that the movie is sloppy, chaotic, has no point, or makes no sense, but you'll want to know why. OK...On the most obvious level I think Bad Santa is essentially a bawdy condemnation of the cruelty of America and the hypocritical piety it has always used to try to cover up that meanness of spirit.  Underlying this country's much-trumpeted prosperity has always been the grittier reality of those--most of us to some degree--who are trampled underfoot by the greed and pressure to succeed that are so prevalent in our culture, and who find themselves wrestling at this time of year with an unspoken loathing of Christmas--because it has become a shameless orgy of materialism, yes, but (more importantly) because the pressure for everything to be happy and perfect throws into horrible relief everything about one's life that is flawed or disappointing.  Enter Bad Santa, which takes relish in crassly demolishing the saccharine American myth of Christmas and liberating us all from our guilt over not being perfect little suburban robot-cartoons. That's the heart of the film as a satire, but there's a human story here, too.Willy is a bitter wash-out, but he's not so horrible that we can't sympathize with him.  He's a self-destructive, foul-mouthed drunk, but as he begins (despite himself) to care for Thurman he proves himself worthy of our interest and concern.  His motivation is simple and is the center on which the plot turns--as is the case with most victims of childhood abuse, he can't bear to see another child destroyed and ruined as he was.  Notice that his worst episodes of drinking come after each time he is berated and cut down by Marcus, and that he comes most alive when Thurman puts himself down or is picked on by the skater kids.  Willy's initially hesitant attempts to reach out to Thurman end up becoming, predictably, the seeds of his own redemption, until by the end he is forced to recognize his life as a sham and he risks it for the sake of one symbolic act of generosity.Thurman is also not so confusing as commenters here have made him out to be.  He's not retarded--just an unexceptional kid who's been through some hard knocks (dead Mom, Dad in jail) and who has been left stunned by the trauma, rendered passive and  confused but still sweet-hearted and needing a parent (figure).BTW, the shot toward the end of Willy lying on Thurman's front step in full Santa regalia, gunned down by the police and riddled with bullets, reaching out to leave the stuffed elephant for Thurman, is an absolutely brilliant image--pure genius.  I'm almost disappointed that they didn't stop the movie there and leave off the happier ending, but that's me.Now--for all that, the movie does have its flaws.  The scenes with John Ritter and Bernie Mac seem strangely scattered and amateurish.  As my g/f hypothesized, Ritter may have died during filming--maybe they had to use rehearsal tapes or something to finish the film.  One can argue that Willy is too simple, that his motivations are too one-dimensional.  The script could have been tighter, as could some of the editing, and the movie on the whole is not quite as funny as we're led to believe by the trailers...though it does have a good handful of solid laughs and one outright hysterical scene.  All of this being said, I liked Bad Santa and still say that the dirty language doesn't hide its basic heart of gold.  This is the Christmas movie George Carlin might make if he could, the Christmas movie America deserves.  8/10",Bad Santa
249,HerbertRousch,Hilarious Holiday fun,9,19 November 2003,This is easily one of the best films of the year. Billy Bob Thornton's scabrous character is hilarious and his performance as the alcoholic bad santa is one of his best.

Those sensitive to foul language should not watch this movie nor FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL. This is not a kiddie movie, but a movie made for adults.Compared to ELF, SANTA CLAUSE, and a whole raft of other so-so Christmas related comedies, this is one of the best. Most holiday humor movies are always on the lightside with an eye to the children market during the holidays. This one ranks in there with A Christmas STORY and PLANES, TRAINS, AND AUTOMOBILES and THE GRINCH WHO STOLE Christmas (cartoon version).BAD SANTA is Christmas at its darkest, full of profanity, bad people, and evil deeds.

I think that Christmas in this movie are not so important like everything else behind it. I am always trying to watch movies without expectation and judgments, so I don't consider relation of author or director to matters, which are private in particular (I mean Christmas for Christians or non-Christians etc). So I appreciate in the first place originality of this kind of bleak comedy in connection with very complicated and dainty themes like friendship between someone who doesn't like himself and small kid. It is the core of the message of this movie like I'v understood it. It is about hope on better life with better self with dark but funny humour.

Every year Christmas gets shoved down your throat, and I was in the mood for a good skewering of the forced holiday cheer. I can't quite put my finger on what's wrong, except maybe the directing wasn't crass enough.  First, the upside. Billy Bob was dead-on, Tony Cox ruled, Lauren Graham was sweet and HOT and the script, though far from perfect, had plenty of low laughs.  I  think Zwigoff's approach might have been too refined for the material.  This is one of those movies that looks more outrageous on paper than it does in execution.  After all, the ""plot"" centered on his relationship with that loser kid and it was lame and unbelievable.  You know, a Scrooge retread like John Hughes would have made in his heyday.  Or maybe one of the Zucker brothers could have hit us over the head with the jokes. The kid lets him move in and no one on the block notices Billy Bob energetically shtupping the sexy bar maid in the hot tub? I'm not buying. BTW, can we just end these movies where Billy Bob gets to nail hot chicks?

My favorite thing about Bad Santa, is that it is different. Instead of showing the make believe, overly happy dreamworld that people think life is, this movie shows that there are some people out there that are that miserable. Billy Bob Thorton's performance makes the movie worth it alone. But the Kid (played by the fantastic Brett Kelly) will steal your heart away. The story of this film, so cleverly created by Joel and Ethan Coen, was very well played out, but I highly dont recommend this to people who do not like dark humor.

It isn't bad, but it's  I'm finding difficulty bringing the right word to mind; I keep landing on, 'eh.' It occurs to me that this movie's script finds this very same difficulty.The movie kept my interest; each actor took hold of his character very comfortably and naturally (with the purposefully-directed exception of The Kid), and each one again kept me interested. I wanted to continue watching them, listening to them. But mid-way through the movie, I felt my face change. My neck hurt. At that moment, I realized that I hadn't smiled or laughed ONCE up to that point. And by the end of the movie, I think I counted two instances when I laughed out loud, and no other instances of smiling.There is such amazing acting in this movie, that it completely out-performs the script and screen writing. I hadn't even noticed I was watching a comedy. I mean, sure, the jokes are foul and there is vile behavior, but what's funny about that when every other word is f**k? I am not offended by foul language. If I have anything against 'The F-word' it is that it steals the flavor and meaning from the words it substitutes. When it's every-other word, f this and f that, f'n, f'n, f'n, the script becomes boring and typical. Replace them back with the original thoughts' words, and you've got comedy!!Some ""scenarios"" are funny, I must add. The guy across the bar, the first aid for The Kid, the spar-session at the ring.

Yes, it's nice to see a movie that doesn't ever compromise its non-P.C. vision, but there's enough quality movies that do this (i.e. South Park, Dogma,) that the standard should be set higher than this.THIS FILM IS NOT FUNNY! I think I laughed twice (and those were accompanied by eye-rolls). Here's why it's not funny:This film operates under the premise that anything, no matter how dark and twisted, can be humorous. I do not contest this idea (see The Royal Tennenbaums, Heathers), but see, there has to be a humorous spin, wit, or interesting joke involved. Saying 'f#%@' a lot is not inherently funny unless you make particularly strong use of the rest of the English language, which ""Bad Santa"" does not do. Alcoholism is not inherently funny unless it's in the context of humorous behavior. But urinating in one's pants is not funny. Cursing at children is not funny. Billy Bob having sex with someone is certainly not funny, nor something that should be permitted to even be hinted at on screen. See, this passes the ""gross-out joke"" fad by completely ruling out the 'joke' part of it altogether. It's just plain gross. And crude. And unclever. And really, really, boring.Still I'm sure there are many people (and if you, dear reader, are one, please seek psychotherapy immediately) who find this movie hilarious. I can hear it now:-'Oh man, when he was too drunk to stand up. God that was so funny I fell off my seat man!'-'Yeah! That kid had snot running out of his nose! Sheer comic genius!!!'-'Oh man, I laughed so hard every time someone said the word 'sandwich'.'-""Dude, no. The best was when he kept saying 'f#%@'.""-'When the kid revealed that his parents were dead, man that was the funniest.""In short, this was a complete waste of an hour and a half of my life. I could have been doing ANYTHING and had a better time than I had watching this piece of garbage. My advice is to avoid this thing at all cost. And if your friend owns a copy, disown him.2/10 (One point for each time I laughed).",Bad Santa
268,tbresson,Good acting but poor movie,4,28 November 2004,"I can't believe this movie got so high a vote and that it even got to the theater, I mean it has it's moments of fun especially when they kick & punch each other in the crouch but other than that it's just a sad attempt to be funny. Put in a midget, a drunk santa and some stereo-type persons and you have yourself a movie - it appears.The acting is not bad at all, it's just the movie itself that doesn't really appeal anything, I mean I would be satisfied if Christmas spirit was there, but if it wasn't - at least some good humor would save it.The acting by Tony Cox was simply just excellent, that man simply knows funny and serious at when to throw it at you!",Bad Santa
269,arigel,Funniest Christmas movie ever,6,10 March 2004,"When I entered the theater to see Bad Santa, I had very low expectations.  I thought this movie would just be the same dribble of low brow humor.  Well, its full of low brow humor as I expected, but I felt it was used in a well made fashion.  Its hard to explain how, but it was a formula that was successful.  I was laughing from begining to end, something rare in movies these days.  It was the surprise movie of the year for me since I ussually know beforehand what I'm going to hate.  This movie proves the old saying of not judging a book by its cover.  Billy Bob Thornton had an excellent performance as a thief posing as a mall santa.  This movie is highly recommended, 9/10.",Bad Santa
270,J_7,Funny advent,7,25 November 2005,"If you like really messed up movies, like the previously released ""Ghost World,"" then you will like this movie. It seems that one of the Weinstein's as well as the Coen brothers were backing this movie up, which shocked me at the get go. By the end, I felt like a little bit of ""Raising Arizona"" was seeping through but since that movie is so funny, the formula worked here, too.Not usually a huge Billy Bob Thornton fan but if you like weird situations that make you wonder who the Kid's parents are in real life, then this is probably the movie for you. The only part that left me going ""huh?"" was in the parking lot after he had just fornicated (hee hee) with the bartender. That guy just attacked him for no reason and then that was it. Very random..There are some genuinely funny parts, like anything that has to do with the advent calendar, so watch it.",Bad Santa
271,relwes,My kind of Santa,9,11 December 2004,"Usually I would go hundreds of miles out of my way to avoid any film with the word ""Santa"" in the title, but I made an exception for this film. This film isn't about the real Santa luckily, it's about a miserable drunken old bastard called Willie who spends every December playing Santa in a mall somewhere in the US. You know the sort of thing: children queue up to sit on his knee, they tell him what they want for Christmas, they pose for a cheesy photo, mommy hands over 5 dollars, and they go on their way. In fact though Willie (Billy Bob Thornton) is only does it as cover to rob the mall. His far more professional partner in crime is black dwarf Marcus (played by Tony Cox) who poses as Santa's little helper.Whether or not you will like this film depends on whether or not you think the premise is funny: Willie is in fact closer to being the anti-Santa. He is a self-centered, chronically-alcoholic, womanising, child-hating, mean man. So if you think the idea of ""Santa"" puking up, pissing himself, chain-smoking, f***ing fat women in the changing rooms, falling over, and swearing at children (a lot) is funny, then this film will not disappoint you. I pretty much do, and I liked this film.One thing that I enjoyed was Billy Bob Thornton's performance: he doesn't let up. There's no suggestion (for most of the film anyway) of any sort of soft-centre to the character, he really is a selfish bastard through and through, who thinks nothing of robbing old women or young children. The humour of the character is not his witty chat, but rather his uncompromising negativity. Part of the fun of the film is seeing how far that can be pushed.Another thing I liked was genuine bizarreness of the main child character. He's a less than adorable bullied fat kid. He has some strange ideas, and this leads to some good funny dialogue between the two characters. I enjoyed the character of Marcus too, and the fact that he and Willie are by no means friends: they just needed each other to do the job. Marcus is constantly shouting at Willie, not in humorously hyperbolic terms, but straight: Willie is a loser who's perpetual drunkenness is jeopardizing their chances, and Marcus is damn well going to tell him so.There are some other nice touches: the constipated mall detective who's always smoking and eating tangerines rather disgustingly, and the politically correct mall-manager who doesn't fire the duo only because he's too pathetic to sack a vertically-impaired African American.The Coen brothers were executive producers for this film, and it has their feel about it: the (only moderately funny) dwarf jokes which run throughout, for instance. Basically if you find bad language remotely offensive, then don't see this film. If you find people who find bad language offensive ridiculous, then rent it on DVD and watch it with your whole family on Christmas day.",Bad Santa

Half hour into it, I was in disbelief that someone ""green lighted"" the making of this movie. It wasn't funny. And there were more F-bombs and other curse words than a George Carlin stand-up act. I can only guess that the writers of this film thought swearing = funny. Guess again. Frankly, I can't even believe that they were able to produce a movie trailer suitable for television with the immense volume of vulgar language.Lauren Graham's character had no point, except to offer gratuitous sex scenes. And even then it was nudity free so what's the point.The movie summary states that an 8-year-old befriends Billy Bob Thornton's character and shows him the spirit of Christmas. Huh?

276,firstalittlebackstory,"Tedious, ugly smut disguised as comedy",1,14 December 2008,"It's not often I consider a film to be so irredeemably ugly and hateful that I can't find some positive quality about it. Even when I hate a movie, I can usually point to something that was done well. But not this time.I suppose I could say that Bad Santa elicited a few guilty chuckles here and there; I felt dirty and uncomfortable laughing but the sheer ridiculousness of the titular character did, once or twice, bring a sheepish smile to my lips. It wasn't enjoyable, however, and I ardently wish I hadn't seen this venomously hateful wart of a film.Billy Bob Thornton plays a sodden, sociopathic con man who, along with a smarmy, foul- mouthed midget, uses his position as a shopping mall Santa to break into department stores after hours and crack safes. He is also an abusive, self-loathing sex addict and, as his midget accomplice informs him at one point, everything about him is ugly. He commits random acts of destruction and violence in a sort of drunken haze; this is not a sympathetic character, nor even an antihero. It is clear from the beginning that ""Santa"" is a very dangerous, chaotic man.There's so much profanity in the dialogue that it's often hard to make out exactly what the characters are talking about. You can feel the writers' love of potty-mouthed toilet humor, as they interject it unnecessarily into every single scene. There is also a predictable number of graphic sex scenes, crotch-kicking gags, unfunny jokes involving a senile elderly woman and her emotionally disturbed, mentally challenged son, and so forth. Never does the movie tinge its irreverence with even a hint of warmth; this is a coldly cruel production designed to titillate the lowest and worst in its audience.I came away from Bad Santa feeling unhappy and disturbed. There is no message here, no point, except that calculated nihilism will always win in the end and concepts like love, beauty, and hope are for saps and suckers who exist only as playthings for the antisocial. This is a movie for true misanthropes only.",Bad Santa

But it's Christmas,and even for losers third,fourth,fifth,or 50th chances sometimes show up.Watching Billy Bob's character 'grow-up'during the film is surprisingly heartwarming.For a broken man,he does the best he can once he allows himself to 'give-a-damm'.

John Ritter was fantastic as the repressed uptight counter point to the rest of the cast, who take vulgarity to formerly unexpressed heights. Mind you.

You are supposed to laugh at the notion of a symbol of childish innocence cursing and drinking himself into a stupor. It ain't funny. It's pathetic in the way that a 5 year old shouting excrement words to get attention is pathetic. Bad as the same character was in the ""Bad News Bears."" Thornton takes this himself to a new low.

The script, performances, direction - absolutely nothing to commend it and coming from a man who brought us Ghost World, that makes it all the more disappointing.

However, leaving the theater after watching this, I discovered how much more it was than what I was expecting. Instead a good movie, I got a great one, with good direction and a wonderful script and, best of all, the performance of Billy Bob Thornton, who makes the film what it is. His foulmouthed, cynical, suicidal character might look two-dimensional on paper and, had another actor taken a stab at this role, come off as forced and tiresome, but Thornton finds just the right blend of humor and reality. The film is touching, but not on the surface. Many viewers will not get it; they'll see this film as a vulgar assault on the Christmas spirit, and, in a way, it is, but deeper than that there is a story here about a man who has lost all faith in the human race and has now been restored. Without being sappy, unlike almost any other film I've ever seen, ""Bad Santa"" is able to make this an emotional journey for a contemptable character, get us to like him, and disguise it behind dark, sick humor. It's a masterpiece of dark comedy and the best holiday film of the last 5 years. **** out of ****",Bad Santa

291,terence-jones2,Suprizingly good,8,8 November 2004,"This is actually a very funny film if you enjoy humour that is Adult in it's orientation. It is certainly not a kids movie (unless teenagers). The story has already been told. Billy Bob's humour is superb, with the greatest of respect to Bill Murray who was supposed to do this role he would not have done it the same justice that Thornton did. Murray is a fine actor but he can't do down market sleazy the way Thornton can. THAT is the key to this movie. Not only is this Santa Bad, but he's also apathetic and has little regard for himself. Tony Cox is superb as the Elf trying to do a ""professional job"" and drag Willie out of the gutter in the meantime. In my opinion Brett Kelly who plays the kid has a fine future ahead of him, he simultaneously manages to evoke both pity and laughter from the viewer in equal measure.The supporting cast is admirable Lauren Graham as Willie's new girlfriend is to be commended and also Bernie Mac(Bosley from Charlie's Angels full throttle) is superb as head of security for the dept store managed by the late, great and sorely missed John Ritter who plays a puritan store manager obsessed with sacking willie and not swearing in equal measure.The laughs come thick and fast, and more importantly, constantly. Too many Christmas comedy films have too much of a gap between laughs (National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation and Scrooged) while both fine films spread the laughs into bunches.

294,reserved_for_unwanted_messages,The good in the bad,7,18 June 2005,"I watched Bad Santa, although not in a timely holiday fashion. This is one of the most potentially offensive movies to offer virtues on a deeper level.The movie is most shocking because a cherished icon is shown doing things like robbing stores, drinking to excess, cursing at mothers and children, and having sex with shoppers. I initially passed on seeing the movie, because it looked like it was on par with American Pie or Eurotripall shock value and toilet humor with few redeeming qualities. But after deciding to view it, I was pleasantly surprised.Ultimately this is a movie about redemption, unlikely friendships, and the value of people over material things. It centers around two characters: Willie, who does a yearly Santa gig as a front for burglary; and ""the Kid,"" a chubby boy who, despite society's apparent rejection of him, is immediately likable. The two meet up and spend their time together like in the movie About a Boy, except that Willie is in a house that he stole, or temporarily appropriated.In its dysfunctional twists on Santa, family and relationships, the movie is actually a fitting modern telling of the Christmas story. A snapshot of contemporary American culture would look more like this movie than most of the sugary holiday movies that have become traditional viewing at the holidays.But although Billy Bob Thornton's Santa is crude, alcoholic, and lawbreaking, and seems to be caught in a downward spiral, he's not beyond hope, although his partner seems to think he is. Willie knows he's not okay. He tries to get back on the wagon, and speaks of ""turning a corner."" The Kid is the moral center of this borderline redemption story. He has no friends and is picked on all the time, but remains full of sincerity, refuses to give up, and retains a faith in people despite their failings. He becomes attached to Willie on first meeting, and follows him around the rest of the movie.Despite the Kid's abiding faith, he is not naive. In one scene, Willie shouts at him in a moment of frustration, ""I ain't f***ing Santa Claus! I am living proof that there ain't no Santa Claus!"" The Kid replies quietly and calmly, ""I know there's no Santa. I just thought maybe you'd wanna give me a present 'cause we're friends."" Willie doesn't want to be friends, with anyone, but begins to see that his attempted isolation doesn't work. His friendship with the Kid grows gradually stronger throughout the movie, and is symbolized in two scenes where the two become blood brothers in a strange but literal way.The Christmas story is present, but has become surreal: the boy is strangely fascinated by an advent calendar that has a peel-off bit of the story of Jesus' birth each day, which opens to reveal a piece of candy. Somewhat reminiscent of A Charlie Brown Christmas, the boy does a beautiful holiday reading.By the end of the movie, Willie has changed. The toughest consequences he faces in the movie happen because he tries to bring a present to the boy. And when facing his own imminent death, he is most saddened that people would want to kill other people over material things.",Bad Santa
295,Andrew-Critchley,Fuhuhunny Men,7,1 September 2004,"Just a quick tribute to the funniest, briefest double act in recent memory, sadly no more. John Ritter and Bernie Mac had me weeping in Bad Santa. BM has some killer dialogue/facial-expression moments on his own, but when the two are together on screen they steal this film. It's a terrible shame JR has died, but at least he can be remembered for some brilliant comedy. This isn't the best film ever made, and the ""hard-core"" content overwhelms the laughs at times, but it has something other gross-out comedies lack - it just feels more real than say the Farrelly Brothers, if less accessible.

Lets face it, the guy is broken and ain't nobody gonna fix him. Unless, of course it is another misfit. Nothing seems to phase Willie, ""The Bad Santa""'s impervious puss except for a totally lovable, loving, innocent child who unconditionally trusts him, warts and all. In that way, the writers have taken redemption, married it to profanity and hatched a love child of grace and truth. You can't go any lower than the main character, the disgusting, disgusted, disillusioned Willie. But, that is what makes Willie just perfect for a naive, misfit child. A child who has little political savvy except for that which allows him to look beyond Willie's flaws.

He cheats, swears, fornicates, drinks, swears, and absolutely loathes children. Add to that his general filthiness and you have a horrible person. However, by the end of the film, he managed to win the favor of every member of the audience. The film is so absurd that you can't help but love it. Absurdity lends to the credibility or the tale. The originality and humor of this creation puts it at the top of the charts for 2003. In the world of moral cinema, where the druggies and drinkers always get their comeuppance, this is a refreshing tale, reminding us an important lesson: Character is what you do when no-one else is watching.",Bad Santa
299,uuberdave,The title says it all,2,11 January 2008,"This movie was aired in New Zealand on Christmas eve. I sat down with my family and expected to have a nice laugh or two at this highly acclaimed film. Within the first 20 minutes my hears had been deafened by the amount of crude and awful language that was coming out of the someone the actors mouths. Our television network even attempted to bleep out the swearing and cursing that was going throughout the film but they were no match for all the language that was going on. We turned off the so called film in disbelief, that our TV network would put on such utter crap and that Thornton would reduce his acting to this kind of stuff. Poor poor movie in my opinion.",Bad Santa

I thought it would be an average dark comedy with some good jokes. After the first 10 minutes i was completely hooked. I laughed so hard that tears rolled down my cheeks. In my head I thought ""this is the greatest film ever"" over and over again. A drunken, miserable, suicidal, mean santa - it can't get any better. This film is the opposite of every other Christmas film you've ever seen, it's the opposite of Disney and it's definitely not a film for kids who still believe in santa clause. I loved it, it went straight to my top 10 list of funniest movies of all time together with the Big Lebowski, O brother where art thou and Beavis and Butthead do America.",Bad Santa

I haven't laughed so hard at a movie since The Big Lebowski. The movie is consistently hilarious throughout, and Billy Bob, as always, is perfect. He reminded me a bit of his character in The Man Who Wasn't There, but without the seemingly good intentions. Though the Coens are only credited as producers, their influence can be found in the script and in the filming. While republicans on Fox News are complaining that this movie puts a stain on the family values associated with Christmas,  the people who were commenting on it hadn't even seen the film. I highly recommend it if you are not easily offended and can't remember the last time you actually laughed during a ""comedy"". Also, the kid was perfect and tugged at my heartstrings throughout the film. I can see an Academy Award for best screenplay in the future, if nothing else. Of course Billy Bob deserves it, but didn't he also for monster's ball? We'll see. Also, I think it's kind of funny that movies with the word ""bad"" in the title have all seemed to flop or suck in the past, but ""Bad Santa"" will change that.",Bad Santa

303,Thunder_Boy,The comedy gods are smiling down upon us.,8,29 December 2003,"Rarely does a movie as completely offensive and un-PC as Bad Santa come through the way that this film has.  The first time I saw it, it nearly put me in tears.  However, it wasn't until I took my 44 year-old father to see it that I realized how great it was.  He hated it, using words such as ""sacrilegious"" and ""brute"" to describe it.  I don't think he was quite the demographic that this film was hunting for.Enter Willie, a despicable man who lives and dies by the three B's: Booze, Bulls***, and, well, fornicating heavy-set women - though he has a much better word for it.  This ghastly man earns his keep by playing a mall Santa with his little friend, who is played by Tony Cox.  Swearing to Cox that he'll never do the Santa gig again, he moves to Miami, but when Christmas time rolls around, he puts on his Santa hat so fast that he gets hat-burn.
John Ritter stars as the politically correct Mall Manager in his last movie role.  His character is an exact foil to Willie, doing anything to keep from getting into trouble, or attracting lawsuits.  The second time (that I know of) that Ritter has teamed with Thornton - the first being Slingblade - and he certainly didn't disappoint.Ritter's character contracts Bernie Mac to find a black mark on Willie's record.  I've always hated Bernie Mac, but he does an excellent job in not putting up with any guff from anyone.  He adds his own flavor of comedy throughout the movie.  This is the first time I've ever appreciated his work.Throughout the movie, Willie Bob Thornton (heh, heh) shacks up with a kid that he met at the mall who thinks he's really Santa, and hysteria ensues. Some of the best moments of the film come from Willie's complete disregard of the kid's feelings.  Nobody else in the theater laughed at this joke, but I personally found it hilarious that Willie didn't even know the kid's name until weeks after he'd already been living in his house.  Eventually, the protagonist learns that there is more to life than the three B's and comes through to give the kid his Christmas wish.The movie is a Christmas-classic, and is the best comedy that Hollywood's' produced in years.  Being a huge Jim Carrey fan, it's difficult not to give Bruce Almighty the nod, but Bad Santa is, without a doubt, the best comedy of the year.",Bad Santa

The lines, the gags and the visuals are all top notch.  No nudity, which I wouldn't have mind seeing - but of course that wouldn't help the film in anyway.Some have posted that its a bad film... its not for everyone, its not for those who find Chrismas so ""dear"" to them.

Frankly I'm surprised there's been so many good reviews on this movie, both on here and when it was released. I really didn't see what was so funny about it. A gigantic chunk of the movie's humor is derived from Billy Bob drunk, perverted and extremely antagonistic...all in a Santa outfit. It got old very fast, and after about a half hour, I started to wonder how much more I'd watch.The thing that kept me watching was the story between Willie (Billy Bob) and the kid. I found it fairly endearing, especially since he was so mean to the kid at first. This comes slowly, so I had to wait out, and the final result isn't great, but it was nice. It was enough to keep me watching.That said, however, I didn't really laugh much. I think the only time I did more than chuckle was when Willie tells the kid to ""wish in one hand, sh*t in the other; see which one fills up first."" That cracked me up.

This movie has great scenes that made me laugh out loud.. A great piece.

Yes, it's very funny but it's much more than a simple comedy as you might think. Bad Santa is above all a story about a man sick of life, that finds everything meaningless and doesn't give a damn about anyone or anything, it is a story about an alcoholic Santa(Thornton) that finds a reason to go on with his life and change at the most unexpected time. This role fits perfectly to Billy Bob Thornton, he delivers a performance that is amazing in every aspect and most importantly believable. He makes you laugh, he makes you cry, managing pretty much to achieve what an actor is supposed to achieve: entertain you, make you feel certain feelings and send a message to the viewer.I enjoyed every second of his performance and every second of this movie. It's the ultimate anti-Christmas movie for some but i think that what's really important in this holy day is excellently shown in the last part of the movie, and that is the spirit of Christmas, the will to do some good and try to be a better person.",Bad Santa

If the delivery was cleaned up a little and the lead characters had even a small part of redeeming quality to them - so they were scoundrels rather than just plain repulsive, this would be a much better film.To put it another way, this had the potential to be a great film but is just a wasted opportunity.

Billy Bob Thornton's interactions with the ""troubled"" kid he befriends is at times almost unwatchable. His cruelty and disregard for others is so harsh--as harsh as his own disregard for himself... and yet you find yourself laughing your behind off. This, of course, is what makes the laughs so great. Thornton is such a loose cannon with a foul mouth--I can't tell you how unsympathetic his character is, you just have to see it for yourself--that when he is teamed up with the little clueless, unflappable, messed up kid that can't even understand when he should be upset by Thornton's character, it's PURE GOLD: ""Marcus, get this kid out of here, he's freaking me out."" Great supporting performances by elfish actor Tony Cox, the late great John Ritter, and that Gilmore Girls chick. Again, if you are not easily offended, check this one out. Look for Ajay Naidu as the Hindustani Troublemaker--his last line is a great reference to the also great Office Space. Funniest interaction: when Bad Santa takes the kid home near the beginning and they have a conversation about whether or not someone dropped the kid on his head.

First of all this movie grossed over 60 million at the domestic box office alone. The budget was only 16 million; peanuts compared to most Hollywood movies. That wouldn't make it a bomb now would it? Lauren Graham's character has a santa fetish that why she gets it on with old Willie. Billy Bob Thorton's Willie is a tour de force. Like any good anti-hero he has his own set of rules.

From being on the top of the heap to the bottom of the cesspool and all of the ""dressing rooms' in-between, Uncle Willie has treats for all the little boys and girls, with out adding any kind of improper thoughts toward children, (if you disregard shouting obscenities to every child he encounters). There are no strange pedophiliac moments, and no nudity to speak of, (really). But with only two exceptions everyone in this film is messed up, and I take that statement back, everyone has a problem in this movie its just that Santa takes the cake, but won't take the sandwiches and cookies when offered.

Worse, in a transparent attempt to bayonet ""shock laughter"" out of the audience, the movie assaults us with wave after endless wave of swearing, in lieu of actual humor. The movie's ""joke,"" if you can call it that, isn't funny and has about three seconds of staying power: Santa and the elf, cherished icons of childhood, use profanities. Isn't that a hilarious juxtaposition, folks?Hollywood figures if it heaps on tons of superfluous profanity, it can convert any lame, unfunny jokes and situations into pure gold. Tragically, judging from the 7.2 rating this turdzilla earned on IMDb, Hollywood is correct. We ARE indeed morons!

A friend told me about it, he said that i should look it up and see it. And so i did... Ever since, this is one of my favorite movies of all time. Shure, you can't compare this film with Exorcist, Shining or Blade Runner. But still, it's a darn good movie.Billy Bob Thornton has been a favorite actor since i first saw U-Turn, by Oliver Stone. The thing that i like the most with B.B, is that he always plays a different character in his films. He never take a role that reminds anyone from his previous roles. (Execpt from his last film, Bad Bears News, were his character is quite similar to his role in Bad Santa, except that he dosen't wear a Santa Claus suit and a beard.)Bad Santa is a very funny film and you will laugh a lot when you watch it, even when you see it for the 20th time. Or, you will hate this film, and think that the jokes are on a kinder garden level. The taste is different. Thank god!B.B plays the drunken Santa who robs malls during Christmas time, and by his side, he got his partner Marcus. Marcus haft to spend most of his time to watch after his pal, Santa. Who always come in late for work, either drunk or in a very bad mood... Most of the times, both...The Kid in this movie also convince. He believes that B.B really is the real Santa, and follow him around and ask a lot of annoying questions. It's all get worse when B.B move in with the Kid.Ovaerall, this is a very good film, who brings out a lot of laughter. But the best part is the end. It's kind of respectable end for this film.

320,eiratan,A Darkly Comic Jab at Everything we hold Dear this Time of Year,8,21 December 2003,"Bad Santa is a truly brilliant film for more than one reason. First off, it doesn't apologize for itself. Too often, especially in Hollywood, films will tie up all the bad stuff and let the good win out at the end, everyone is reformed and happy, blah blah blah. Either that, or the new age approach is taken and everyone dies (not quite so American, but starting to spread here more and more.) Bad Santa tells a story of a truly despicable man, who through the trusting eyes of a child manages to infiltrate his home and take advantage of his family, as well as his day job of ripping of malls every Christmas.Granted, Billy Bob's character has to grow a little. If he didn't the film wouldn't progress, but in the case of Bad Santa we're not seeing a whole lot. He's a jerk, a drunk, and a lecher and he's not going to change just because it's Christmas. The dark tone of this film will carry straight through to the end, (btw. a very effective ending, that manages to negate the nausea his actions instill in you throughout the rest of the film.)This movie is hilarious.

All of the supporting performances are great as well.  The movie is twisted, but ends up being sweet in a weird way.  Its wonderful because Billy Bob Thornton's character never suddenly changes just to deliver a good ending; the ending stays true to all of the characters.

327,sunlit_dreams,Bad Santa is a pretty 'bad' movie! Ugh...,3,25 December 2015,"My husband usually finds most comedy enjoyable. I find only some comedy enjoyable. We are both avid movie-watchers. Neither of us enjoyed this movie at all. At 44mins in (47mins to go), my husband thought it 'might' be picking up... but lost interest in further watching. In my opinion, if it takes half the movie to start getting better, then it's a bad movie.This movie relies on the presentation of an immoral, irreligious, cursing Santa as it's chief premise. That it is a 'bad' movie, in in my opinion, isn't a reflection on the acting or direction, both of which seemed pretty good. Perhaps it's more redeeming feature was Brett Kelly's portrayal of 'The Kid', which makes an excellent foil to Billy Bob Thornton's 'Bad Santa'. The script, however, left a lot to be desired and seemed only designed to appeal to some. For us the dialogue and plot were both pretty uninspired and seriously lacked.If you enjoy a mockery of the traditional concept of Santa, and love a script liberally salted with a wide range of cursing, then you may possibly love this movie. We, however, did not enjoy it. Final tally: 1 for the acting, 1 for the direction & 1 for the presentation. 0 for all else.",Bad Santa
328,kshiarella,Brilliance behind the taboos,8,8 February 2011,"Sadly, this film will not pass the ""look test"" for the majority of viewers. On first pass, the movie is shocking, vulgar and there is something in there to deeply offend just about everyone. John Waters would approve.Beyond the affront to 'decent' values, is a beautifully crafted redemption story, and in many ways it is a more elegant rendition of the ""A Christmas Carol"" redemption of Scrooge.Our protagonist, with whom it is remarkably difficult to empathize, is truly a self-loathing, despairing man. He is immersed in self-abasing vice. He finds himself partnered with a hateful dwarf whose abuse draws our Bad Santa deeper into despair. Viewers should note that Santa's worst drunken outbursts throughout the movie immediately follow scenes where he is verbally abused by the Elf Marcus.On the brink of suicide, redemption finds a toe-hold in the form of the love of a (ridiculously)innocent child and a woman.Viewers hoping to see an arc of redemption of Santa going from a bad person to a good one will be disappointed. What we see is a a vulgar despairing man turn into a vulgar man with a new taste for life.And this is the skeleton of the story of courageous film making. But risk taking is not the only virtue here. The cinematography is a treat. Observe the first scene as the camera glides in from a snowy street into a warm holiday scene in an inviting bar and our eyes fall on our wretched, out of place ""protagonist."" We then follow our drunken Santa into the snow covered ally where, silhouetted against the beautiful snowfall, he pukes into the snow. All to the score of serene classical music. Thus, the film shocks us with these contrasts, ugliness among beauty. This is the core of the humor of the film, its punch-line.Strange peripheral characters add to the twisted nature of the film. While Santa may be a wretched human being, the people that swirl around him are absurd. Marcus, the abusive dwarf, his squeaking, greedy mail-order bride, Santa's girlfriend with a ""Santa fetish,"" the barely living Granny, the bizarre mall staff duo played brilliantly by Bernie Mac and John Ritter. Ritter in particular, steals every scene that he is in. And of course, the boy is totally off the wall. All provide a surreal backdrop to our ""Scrooge's"" journey.Most people who will be reading this review are either another fan or someone who would like to see it burned. But I wish those who fall in between the two extremes could be reached to give the movie a closer look. There is a good film underneath the shocking surface.",Bad Santa

This film is highly overrated!,1,31 December 2003,"I went to see this based on someone else's recommendation that we see it because it would be a fun, light holiday movie.  They were badly mistaken. This is by far the WORST movie I have seen - EVER!The biggest issue I had with it was the colossal amount of vulgar language used in it.  The language was worst I had ever seen in a movie.  Nearly every other word was ""F"" this or that.  My opinion is that the humor (if you can call it that) was so weak it couldn't carry its own weight without the incessant use of profanities.  The first time might have had some entertainment value (mostly from shock factor), but after that, it was nothing but offensive.I was also very disappointed at the use of a young child's exposure to patently adult situations.  There was even the indication that he at least to some degree understood some of them.  I found it profoundly disturbing that anyone would depict Santa Claus as a drunk who swore both in front of and at the children who came to see him.This film's one redeeming quality was its conclusion.  After about two hours of shaky plot progression and offensive language, the last few minutes ended up being somewhat touching.  This was carried almost solely by the performance of Brett Kelly.My recommendation - see this movie only if you have a burning desire to hear some of the most offensive language known to mankind carried out by a character who is supposed to be endearing to children followed by a briefmoment of humanity.  If you're not someone who is thrilled and excited by the inclusion of as much profanity as possible, this movie is probably not for you - it sure wasn't for me.",Bad Santa

I am STILL laughing about it...",Bad Santa
333,jpmis,What were they thinking . . .,1,28 November 2003,"Billy Bob Thornton does a convincing job of being perhaps the most repugnant lead character in the history of cinema. As such, there is no particular reason to see the film because you grow to hate him as much as he hates himself.The plot involves the transition of Thornton's character, Willie, from vile reprobate to slightly less vile reprobate by falling under the influence of a needy boy. The warm fuzzy part where Willy's arc finally shows him as a good guy happens mostly off camera and far too late for us to care.I'm not normally squeamish about profanity, I can take as much as Tarantino throws at me without offense. However so much profanity here was directed at an 8 year old boy that I lost whatever mood I'd need to be in to find the film humorous.Which is why the film just doesn't work, Thornton plays it far too straight. When Willie calls the boy a ""f-ing idiot"" to his face, we have no choice but believe he means it. There's no shy grin or twinkle in the eye to cue the viewer that ""hey, I'm only having fun here."" Thornton was too good at being vile, lacking even a hint of warmth or humor that should have been brought to the part.Cloris Leachman, fantastic in ""Malcom in the Middle"" was totally wasted here. As was John Ritter's one note nebbish character which was far less than interesting.All in all, a lot of wasted effort to a bad result.",Bad Santa
334,barleysinger,"Tried for satire, misssed and found pathos",6,27 January 2021,"The movie is well put together but I think the writers and director/producer team missed on a basic concept of humor. This is the sort of dark humor (or an attempt at it) where a character we expect to act one way, doesn't - and you need certain other elements for that to be funny, none of which are present.It's supposed to be a satire of contrast. For this to work we need our misfits to be in a world where at least SOMEBODY is a likable person living a fairly normal life. They only vaguely relatable character is a very depressed & neglected kid which isn't exactly fertile ground for fun (unless you find children being neglected and beaten-up to be humorous). The con-men have to be relatable people but they are irredeemable examples of abnormal psychology - not satires. They are a distillation of how real horrible people really do act. Willie the conman is drunk, sex obsessed, abusive, violent and uses people for whatever he can get. None of those actions are portrayed in a comic manner, just as facts. They kept missing comedy and finding pathos instead.",Bad Santa
335,dolemite4201,Just plain bad,3,23 July 2004,"When I first saw previews of this movie, I thought it looked like a piece of crap that I would never see.Surprisingly, I had friends who said it was good, funny, and recommended it. I trusted these friends' opinions, so I thought I would give it a shot.Yuck! What a horrible disappointment. I like dark comedies, and I am not put off by bad language or general hostility. What I am put off by, however, is dumb movies with silly, contrived dialogue and story lines and zero-dimensional characters. Nothing in the movie was realistic or made any sense. Like someone as hot as Lauren Graham would fall for a pathetic old Santa, just because of her ""santa fetish"". Please. There were some funny moments, especially involving the little black elf. But even his antics became tiresome after a while.Just stay away from this movie. Don't end up like me, wondering ""Why the hell did I waste my time watching that forgettable nonsense"" as the credits rolled.",Bad Santa
336,dragon-134,Just plain BAD,3,14 December 2004,"Bad Santa is bad not in the naughty sense but in the just plain bad sense. Bad writing. Bad soundtrack. Bad comedic timing. Overrun with cuteness and cliché. With superb actors, this movie still couldn't pull it off. And I was shocked to see that Joel and Ethan Cohen produced it! Now don't think me a prude; I love profanity done well. Richard Pryor, Chris Rock, Redd Foxx, George Carlin, Lenny Bruce are just some of the masters of dirty talk. But the weird thing about this movie is that where the profanity would work, the conversation is clean and vice-versa. I found it exhausting to watch. Glad I waited until it was on video to see it. And a free video at that! Big disappointment.",Bad Santa
337,idiopath,The perfect Christmas antidote,10,23 December 2004,"Hilarious from start to finish, this movie covers the story of an alcoholic safe cracker who works as a shopping mall Santa to steal money from the mall on Christmas eve. The concept of the movie is simple and the script is razor sharp with well drawn characters enhanced by faultless performances throughout. As with all good comedies, the material is inspired but it's the delivery that makes it unforgettable. Thornton proves that when it comes to Dead-pan comedy, there's no one better! His performance alone would be enough to make this film good but the fact that his high standards are maintained by the rest of the cast elevates it to a classic.",Bad Santa
338,KGB-2,An hour and a half you'll never get back,2,20 August 2004,"I watched ""Bad Santa"" on pay-per-view based on its favorable rating and reviews. Unfortunately, it was a complete waste of time and for the most part unfunny. Although there are a few (very few) amusing sight gags, they are not worth the hour and a half you'll never get back. I'm a huge Billy Bob Thornton fan, but not even his talent and that of the other fine cast members can save this insipid film and its pitiful plot. There are no engaging characters except perhaps ""The Kid"" who is for the most part annoying. If you can connect with a lead character that's cold, cruel, and an alcoholic, you may enjoy this film, otherwise save your time and money.",Bad Santa
339,Esquire-3,A disappointing misfire,3,17 December 2004,"After thoroughly enjoying director Terry Zwigoff's previous works, Crumb and Ghost World, and being something of a Billy Bob Thornton fan as well, I was ready to be entertained by the concept of ""an eating, drinking, sh**ting, f***ing Santa Claus."" But the joke wears thin very quickly, with two-dimensional characters and a predictable story line that plods along like a drunk stumbling through a field of dog sh**. Sure, real people use foul language like we hear from several of the characters, but it's rendered meaningless when delivered non-stop. I'm sure some found it shockingly disgusting, others found it shockingly hilarious, but I was just bored.",Bad Santa

Billy Bob is perfect as the Bad Santa: a very, very, VERY bad person.  His first line of the movie describes the depth of his self-loathing, which certainly is impressively deep.But for all of its hatred and mean spirit (or maybe because of it), this is one hell of a funny movie, if darker than most black comedies.  Sure, many of the situations are painfully contrived, but this is a heck of a funny movie.  A dark black comedy, but one with more laugh-out-loud situations than any in recent memory.  Just make sure not to bring the kids to this one, folks.",Bad Santa

I am a avid movie watcher, I am disabled and have little to do with my time. I enjoy computers and movies. Now into this crapola, this is by far one of the 3 worst movies I have ever seen. The other 2, I don't even remember them. But this one does stand out as being terrible. If you have children, even younger teenagers. Then by no means should you purposefully allow them to watch this. I found that it was in no way funny, it has about 3 lines that got a smirk. And thats being generous. It was in no way a Christmas film, and I did not expect it to be. But, a poor Christmas film is hard to make. This is one of those movies that really should not have been made. I did not give any spoilers, I did watch the movie all the way through(very hard to do). However, I do see that there is a lot of either loved it or hated it. And I would recommend if you want to see what a awful movie really is, then this is the movie for you. I collect movies, I am up to 1,007 DVD's. And actually I have this one. Maybe when I'm 90 and senile I can sit back and enjoy this like a 2 year old. Otherwise, I have it just to loan out to friends warning them its so bad. How many times has it been loaned out (ZERO).",Bad Santa
343,charliexx,I loved this movie!,10,2 July 2004,"This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen! It is so witty and heartfelt. A real story with real, honest, regular people with flaws and heart and individuality. It makes no apologies and goes right for its jokes - and not the obvious ones. Billy Bob Thorton gives one of his best performances. He gets right into the character and is so believable.I was so glad to finally see a movie for adults, with adult humor and subjects. And to find that there was actually a story and well-developed characters. Who knew those kind of movies still existed?! There was nothing gratuitous about it and for as vulgar and gross as it sometimes is, there is still something so charming and touching about it.What a clever, unique film. If you are in the mood for something refreshing and different and original, see this movie. You will not be disappointed. And you'll laugh your butt off! Thank you.",Bad Santa
344,sweetsour,A children's movie full of swearing & sex?,3,5 July 2004,"I still don't understand how this movie got such high rating on IMDb. I'm not so picky and watch some movies of the worse kind, but I fell asleep while watching Bad Santa. Maybe it's because Billy Bob - he's not my favourite actor - though he did fine in Monsters Ball. But this movie? Please. Who is the target audience in the first place? This is supposed to be a family movie. None of the characters were attractive to me. Its story isn't too interesting to adults in my opinion, it is quite similar to The Kid. So, if this is meant to target children, why is it full of swearing & sex?",Bad Santa
345,biggushlong,Produced by the Cohen Brother's - A Continuous Classic,10,26 November 2019,So It's dark and funny. But it's also produced by the Cohen Brothers. It somehow feels they were involved even before seeing their credits. The movie is a bonafide classic. A bit like The Big Lebowski ...This has a time and a place. And this time is Christmas. I make an effort to watch this year on year....sometimes I miss a year. You can watch this at anytime of the year. It reminds you of how fun it can be at such a time of mass shoppers and cheesy adverts. Constantly hyping everything. But honestly there are so many little things you can miss. There are 3 versions of this film...Theatrical....Director's Cut and Extended. I have seen them all and eventually plumped for the Theatrical as It is probably the most rounded. The language used on 'the Kid' is epic and it took me a couple of years after seeing it to think...Did I really see that and did that really happen!? After that if you like films...You're hooked!,Bad Santa
346,bricar2,Quite possibly one of the best movies ever made!,10,4 December 2006,"In an age of political correctness this movie brings some much needed relief. Bad Santa is unafraid to offend and scores big on the laugh front. The first time I saw this movie was the day before a long road trip. On that trip movie lines kept popping up and I laughed myself all the way to my destination. There are so many funny scenes in this movie. Santa and a plus-sized woman, a little person in the boxing ring with a kid, John Ritter discussing what he heard in the dressing room, a black prostitute and Billy Bob, and basically every time Santa has a kid on his knee.Enjoy this movie with a friend...just make sure your mom never sees it!",Bad Santa
347,paulproia,I must have missed it...,1,9 July 2004,"Okay - I decided to rent it first, rather than pay the bigger bucks to see it in the theatre. Thank my lucky stars I did that - it only cost $4.50 rather than $13.50 to give up on it.Ordinarily, I don't mind dark humor. However, you are so bombarded by the profanity that you miss the point. (A previous IMDb reviewer suggested there were 243 profane statements in the 91 minute running time, which means one every 20 - 25 seconds; it sure seemed like more than that. And, it's higher if you don't count scenes with no dialog.) Forget unnecessary - the Santa character could have been equally low brow having removed 90% of the foul language. Frankly, I was surprised that the credits didn't include profanity.So, no - your kids can't watch this. I can hardly imagine what the unrated version must sound like. My intelligence was insulted, and eventually it was grossed out. Hearing Lauren Graham talk dirty to the ""bad santa"" during their quickie finished it for me. I want to see the irony, but even that was overplayed. The characters are pathetic - but I mean it in the worst sense of the word.Anyway... I couldn't make it past the half hour mark. I SAT through all of Roadie (Meat Loaf, Deborah Harry, circa 1979), which I swear is the worst movie ever made - but now I'm not so sure. At least by returning it early, I'll save a buck on my next rental.Do you ever wonder if actors watch the movie and then think to themselves ""what was I thinking - this will ruin my career..."" - I know I would. And to think someone spent between $10 and $20 million to make and distribute this bad boy. Surely there are better scripts and ideas out there than this one.How this movie AVERAGED 7.2 or more with IMDb viewers is beyond me.",Bad Santa
348,pianocomposer,One of the funniest movies ever made (not kidding),10,14 December 2010,"There's only three motivations to write an online IMDb review: (1) love to see my own words in print, (2) Write a bad review cause I hated that damn movie and (3) Loved the movie and want to share the reason why. I am #3 without apology: I loved this movie because it made me laugh so hard I was having trouble breathing. It's funnier than Blazing Saddles & The Hangover. I. am. not. kidding. Totally. Hysterical. And at the end it made me cry actual tears. In literature, they talk about how the main character undergoes a transformational experience... where change actually happens. I dunno who wrote the script for Bad Santa, but Billy Bob's character goes from scum sucking sack of *hit to loving caretaker of somebody-else's-kid. He ends up taking a bullet or two because he has changed so much. And the transformation is believable. Thorton is a credible, talented actor that gives an Oscar-worthy performance. Bad Santa was nominated for at least 7 awards and won 1. Every third word out of Thorton's character's mouth starts with f and has four letters. Or contains that magical four-letter ""f"" word with some creative variation. His character poses as Santa Claus along with his side-kick, a black midget ""elf"". On the night before Christmas, the two of them stay behind in the department store and steal everything in sight, and Thorton's character cracks the safe for the big money take. In the mean time, Thorton befriends a sad, nerdy kid who is abandoned by his family. So he moves into the house without permission and starts taking care of the kid. If you can call drinking and passing out and cursing ""caretaking"". But this kid is special, and they develop a loving relationship gradually as the movie progresses. By the end of the movie, Thorton is fighting for this kid, teaching this kid right from wrong (even though he isn't sure which is which) and cares so much he eventually gets shot trying to do the right thing for this kid. I laughed through most of the movie because the characters were so debauched and the situations were so absolutely, unbelievably WRONG. Then, at the end, I cried. Bad Santa had become Good Person. He (mostly) quit drinking. He was willing to die for genuine love of another human being. He transformed into someone worthy of being called a human being. I loved this movie. It's on my top 10 movies of all times. It's up there with Casablanca, Star Wars, and The Wizard of Oz. Seriously. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It touched me and moved me and altered my view of how people can become better. Ultimately, this is a movie about redemption.

Absolutely talentless - to put that much cursing into a film means they don't have the brains to come up with anything else to say. Such a joke - I want my $5 back (thank God I waited for it to come out on video before watching it!)!! I discourage anyone who is thinking about seeing this movie. It's a waste of time and money, and it will probably make your IQ drop a few points, too. Pass on this one, folks. I know there has to be something better out there...",Bad Santa

Kinda figured since Billy Bob had been w/ Angelina Jolie any pic he'd be in had to be good & what can I say other than this indicator is even better that I thought it would be. Bad Santa is perfectly cast, directed with the skill only a higher being could bring, and is so funny you'd better have time to watch it w/o stopping. Lauren Graham as Sue couldn't be any better. We all should be so lucky as to experience Sue's sense of adventure and concern for her fellow man. Want to see more of this stellar talent.One of the best scripts ever written. No fat, no fluff, just hard hitting perfection. Great music as well.Bad Santa takes all the elements that make up the film art form & set new standards for what a film can be.Darwin couldn't have beat the evolutionary track this pic created. After all the negative stuff I heard about Bad Santa, it was NOT expected, and proved just how short-sighted some / all too many can be.Bad Santa is a tale of love, the best of the holiday spirit, finding one's path, and turning problems into solutions & making the best of what life throws a person - Not condemning people / things / etc. for failing to be a clone of a disinfectant.Loved the editing, cinematography, lighting, everything! Briana Norton as Pinball Girl is the reason why the Film Industry exists in the First Place. Actresses like this are the reason why producers & executives alike g-light multi-million dollar projects.

This is definitely up there with other holiday favorites like ""A Christmas Story"" and ""The Grinch"" (the cartoon version). Billy Bob Thornton delivers a dead-on performance as the drunken Santa. I never really liked the guy, but this movie completely changed my mind. Tony Cox was also hilarious as Marcus. Lauren Graham was good too. She's cute. John Ritter had a decent role too, he was funny as the uptight department store manager. It was just unfortunate that this would be the last character he'll ever play.The jokes are funny, and they don't stop coming.

However, the 7+ rating that users have given to Bad Santa at the time of my reading inspire me step up and bash it (what it deserves) for the sake of IMDb credibility.

He hates life and everything about it, and he is a drunken, a chain smoker, foul mouthed and rude. But you will love him and he makes for brilliant humour with his lines.

I saw the movie this afternoon and to my dismay there were actually young kids in the theater. Personally, if you are not over 13, I don't think this is an appropriate film to see, even with a parent. That being said, the movie is hilarious. The entire audience was laughing out loud throughout the entire movie. Yes, Willie is a very pathetic character, but the little boy in the movie somehow seems to redeem him a bit. The Kid, played by new-comer Brett Kelly, is an absolute scene stealer. From the moment he came on screen, the movie improved tremendously. Another supporting character that stole my heart, was Sue, played by the lovely Lauren Graham. At first, I couldn't see someone as sweet and charming having an attraction to a guy like Willie, but later you can see that Sue is a caregiver who just wants to love and be loved. Also, if anyone was wondering if there are any nude scenes, there are none really. In one scene,you can only see Sue's bare back.  A complaint I have is that I would have liked the supporting characters to have had more to do. The only character I was not particularly fond of was Bernie Mac's character, but he is not in the movie for all that long. I like the actor, I just didn't like his character. Billy Bob was perfectly cast for this movie. No matter what preconceived notions I had about him from the press, I still think he is a phenomenal actor. Yes, there are a lot of profane words in this movie, but fortunately it did not distract me from the story. It seemed true to Willie's character to use language like that. I was expecting to hate this movie because I love the traditional type of Christmas movie, but it was a nice change of pace. If you go with an open mind, you will probably enjoy this movie. I would give ""Bad Santa"" a solid B.",Bad Santa

358,ChickaBoom,Christmas Movie with a HUGE twist...a low life. *SPOILERS*,8,20 December 2003,"I sit down and the first line I hear from Thornton's mouth was encompassing his horrible life and how this by far was the worst it has ever been. Lines like this continue throughout the movie, provoking laughter over the depth his life has sunk to. He can't sink any lower, i think. But he does, oh how he does. And in the most entertaining ways.There were some great technical shots that made the moment. Like, for instance, when Thornton's character passes out after drinking to much. (an imprinted theme in the movie) Instead of seeing his entire body fall, the camera follows his head - making it seem as if only the background behind him was moving.The script was as good as it was gonna get, and Thornton made it believable. John Ritter's last performance, as a sexually censored department store manager, was a good one. Bernie Mac's character was one of those disposable types. Without him, the movie would've been just as good. His security guard turned bad was superfluous, and just plain 'eh'. This film lacks elements of surprise, and fails to involve the viewer emotionally even though we are with Thornton throughout the entire movie. Truth be told, maybe it was just because there wasn't much of a metamorphosis in this man. He started scum, and he ended as scum. But he did teach the 6 year old to kick bullies in the nuts.Not the greatest movie of the year - but the most honestly criminal Christmas movie for sure.",Bad Santa

It is nonsensical and preposterous. John Ritter's character makes no sense. Bernie Mac goes through the film with a grand total of one expression on his face. The idea of the drunken Santa who has peed all over himself and having a mouthful of puke-breath being attractive to a variety of women who virtually stand in line to have sex with him is astonishingly inane. 100 % pure, unadulterated crap!!",Bad Santa

It has comedy obviously, but it is also sexy, dramatic, suspenseful, and great. The message behind the whole movie wasn't a joke. It was that Christmas shouldn't be about the commercialism. This was symbolized in many areas through the film, one being the pink elephant. Seriously, if you haven't seen this movie, go see it, its one of my new favorites.Also, if you liked John Ritter, you should probably go see this, because it was the last film he was in. His acting was wonderful, as was everyone else's. Thornton (of course), Lauren Graham, Bernie Mac, and Tony Cox all lend their fine acting skills to this movie. There's even a guy that used to be on Mad TV that did pretty well.I bought the DVD, Badder Santa, and it is loaded with extras.

Billy Bob Thornton is perfectly cast as the antihero - it's hard imagine anyone else being more effective in this role. As long as you are not afraid to laugh at things that are totally socially unacceptable to laugh at, you will very likely enjoy this movie. It was not smart to see it on a first date (as I did), but it turned out well - I learned right off the bat that her sense of humor was just as warped as mine, which is, you know, nice to have in common. We were laughing about various lines for the rest of the night and beyond - it's the kind of movie that will hit you days later with random chuckles, and that you'll shake your head about while recommending it (with huge disclaimers) to all of your friends.

There are several places in the movies where it could just begin a steady downfall in to typical family comedy but it never does. Whenever you think they're about to have some kind of cliché soppy moment they hit you with a bunch of carefully crafted and imaginative strings of curse words (usually aimed at children).

It has hilarious humour and its almost an unique growth story of a man that has grown tired of his miserable life and finds something worth fighting for.The thing that bothers me is that some people criticize the film cause it has too bad language. In my opinion the used language is important part of the film. I wouldn't find the characters very ""authentic"" if they wouldn't use the kind of language they do.Maybe its part of modern trend. People are shocked if somebody swears or shows a breast in TV and after that they go see some idiotic TV series or action movie where they kill 1000 people and not even blink.Is the message ""violence is OK, but sex/nudity and swearing is not"" somehow logical? I think in the real life its quite the opposite.",Bad Santa
366,sonuvgawd,Not for the weak stomached,7,29 November 2004,"Constant bombardment of expletives and sexual indiscretion make this a love it or hate it film. The director must have engaged this with intent of pissing off a few. For those who appreciate comic vulgarity, this movie is often amusing. For the starch-shirted-tucked-in-pants, you might lose your meal over this one. Willie is an alcoholic (understatement) con-artist with nothing to live for. His life is composed of the bare necessities, eating, sleeping and screwing. The other characters are equally deranged or abnormal. There are a few scenes where the viewer is left wondering, ""how the hell did that make it past the cutting board?""",Bad Santa
367,Ikari2015,Wow,8,6 November 2006,"This was not what I expected at all. The previews made it out to be some Santa Clause 2 adventure. I finally saw and I have to say I was dead wrong and quite impressed. The great thing about this movie is that all the characters are so real. They all have their own pathetic quirks and they make you smile in a genuine way. None of the humor was forced, Thorton owns, Graham is hot but real, and that kid has got to be the best child actor today. Seriously he sold the role of pathetic little fat kid. I have to say he gave Thorton a run for his money. If some drunk guy and a midget were going to rob a mall every year dressed as Santa and his elf this is movie that would make me believe such an outragious plot could be put on the screen. This movie is a must see for any time of year not just Christmas.",Bad Santa
368,speedgaragefreak,One santa you wont want to see coming down your chimney,10,2 January 2006,"A most excellent film that exceeded expectations. Billy Bob Thornton (""willie"") manages to portray a hopeless cause whose life is falling apart at such a rate that you start to pity the guy, but the pity doesn't last long as he trudges on inflicting his hate for life on everyone. Tony Cox plays his elf (Marcus)very well and with so much hate for willie its only a matter of time... John Ritter plays (Bob)the suspicious store manager so well you'd think the part was written for him. John will be greatly missed..R.I.P. dude. The film manages to turn being ""politically correct"" over on its ass in such a way it shows being ""PC"" isn't always right.

370,chadwilliams,One of the funniest!,10,27 December 2007,"This has to be one of the funniest movies of all time. First of all, it begins with the writing. How brilliant of the writers to create such a unique kid and his relationship to ""Santa"". It was just one brilliant scene after another with that kid. The lines were non-stop hilarious. Then, you had that dwarf character and his relationship with ""Santa"". Again, the brilliant comic lines were non-stop. And then you have Billy Bob's brilliantly written and acted Santa. His whole attitude towards everyone (in particular, the kids) and everything was brilliant. I think Billy Bob Thornton is one of the most natural and interesting actors in film today. He also knows how to pick film roles. Again, my hat is off to the writers of this great film. I hope they write many more comedies because nobody does it better.",Bad Santa
371,ImmortalWombat,A feelgood tale for the cynical.,9,15 June 2004,"In the real world, where security guards are mean and petty minded, store managers are more interested in bad publicity than good customer relations, and Santa doesn't really exist, it's hard to enjoy yet another Disney feelgood flick. The message in those films may be valid, but the wrapper is just too wholesome. It's like a peanut butter sandwich made with extra dry wholemeal bread - it's just too hard to swallow.Enter Bad Santa, a film filled with characters that have almost no redeeming characteristics - an alcoholic, safe-cracking Santa who likes penetrating large women in an unnatural body cavity, a heartless black midget murderer and his materialistic mail order bride, and a head of security more corrupt than all of them. Mix in an overweight and badly bullied retarded child, a barmaid with a Santa fetish, and a nervous store manager and your cast is complete.The core plot is your basic feelgood movie staple; bad guy with no life or family ties gets involved with loser kid and finally finds something to care about, thus redeeming him despite forty years of being a complete and disgusting loser. In this case, Thornton is a safe cracker who, along with Tony Cox as an elf, dresses up as Santa so that they can perform inside job robberies, cleaning out the store's safe on xmas eve, when it's full of all the holiday takings. Thornton ends up befriending an overweight kid and... well, watch the movie and see how it all works out, I'm not going to spoil it for you.Two things save this film from being a cliché ridden and pointless experience.Firstly the casting, it's impeccable. Billy Bob Thornton (stupid name, great actor) in particular excels as the drunk and selfish Santa. He's rude, disgusting and offensive, but never once does he slip out of character and into caricature. The rest of the casting is just as strong, including an excellent Store Manager, John Ritter's final film role.Secondly the script, it's excellent and uses Hollywood clichés without conforming to them. The dialog perfectly suits each character, and is sometimes laugh out loud funny, and contains some old fashioned slapstick comedy for good measure. And the happy ending isn't very happy, but it's a lot happier than things were at the start of the movie and perhaps that's the best these sorry souls can hope for.The direction is nothing special, but neither is it terrible. It tells the story without getting in the way with clever shots and fancy techniques, and for that I'm grateful. The director is content to let the actors tell the story and they do it well.I give this a 9/10 and recommend you watch it every Christmas instead of the obligatory re-run of The Sound of Music.",Bad Santa

Swearing drinking swearing drinking swearing at kid, pissing self (twice believe it or not) swearing at more kids, drinking and smashing bottles, trying to kill himself, getting laid totally inexplicably by the beautiful Gilmour Girl (are you kidding me?)...They must have saved a lot of money having not to hire any comedy writers.Save yourself the time, get a bottle of Old Grand Dad, dress up as Santa, drink the entire bottle, swear at every kid you see, then collapse in the gutter covered in your own excrement and you will have lived this sorry movie for yourself...",Bad Santa

Now that's something we've never seen before), and the story is an extremely ill scripted affair, never attempting to explain at any point what makes the characters the way they are, or why they have to swear every other word (the dialogue goes from being dire to sheer disgusting).

The rating and cast of great, funny actors like Billy Bob Thornton, Lauren Graham and Bernie Mac probably gave me way too high expectations.The plot is not that bad either: a depressed Billy Bob Thornton makes his living through being a shopping mall Santa 30 days a year. Drunk and getting mad at all the kids asking for gifts during opening hours and cracking the store's safe when the lights go out with some help from his elf.Perhaps the movie would have been a lot better with a Jim Carrey-kind of actor as Santa. Billy Bob is a great actor in my book, with top performances in Bandits, Love Actually  not to mention Monster's Ball. But watching him as a drunken Santa, peeing all over him self, puking and cursing for 90 minutes just feels wrong.Sure, the movie creates a few laugh, but they are too few and far in between. How come Lauren Graham and Bernie Mac isn't used more frequently in the movie? That would surely been more entertaining! The quick and sharp Lauren from TV's Gilmore Girls is reduced to a horny barmaid with way too few lines.Bad Santa could have been a holiday classic, but got stuck in the snow.",Bad Santa

The best one liners in the film are where Billy Bob is having sex with a girl in the changing rooms and he says 'when I have finished with you, you won't sh*t right for a month'. What a one liner and many more of this kind. Could watch this film over and over again. Should be in the top 250 without a doubt.

We were the only people there who knew what we were getting into beforehand, and, I think, the only ones who actually enjoyed the movie. Flawless performances by all. Clever, twisting script with unexpected surprises that just seem to keep coming. John Ritter's shocked mall manager portrayal was worth the admission price alone - even better than his ""Sling Blade"" performance. ""What's up with the f'ing sandwiches?"" is still a jocular catch phrase at our house *years* later! I rarely buy movies, as I am usually can't watch the same thing over and over again (unlike listening to music), but I bought this one 'cause I think it is one of the most funny movies ever made, along with ""Young Frankenstein"" (another fave that I roared at in the theater on it's original release -uh=oh, now I'm dating myself!).",Bad Santa

It only accentuates the comedy in this movie and it is not aimed at children, if an adult can't stand to hear a few frowned upon words (about 150 in fact) then there's something wrong with them.

The ultimate scumbags that use Christmas and Santa to profit. Hmm.. At least these monsters are honest with themselves. . . The dialogue & one liners are so off beat at times it took a few extra seconds to register how of the wall it was. A child asks Santa for a Fraggle stick. What the heck is a fraggle stick? The weird little extra characterizations. Like the head of security smoking cigarettes disgustingly while he ate oranges. Real strange yet made perfect sense for the character. Shocking? Sort of.

The main character and the young boy who he befriends both lived such sad lives. It was an odd friendship, indeed, but it really was sweet. Somehow around all the vulgarity and sick situations, which I actually did think were pretty funny, the writer was able to make me feel empathy for both Bad Santa and that unique, sad child.

387,Raydeen,No Bad Santas!,9,1 December 2003,"Bad Santa is the most unapologetically wrong, twisted, f*@!&d up movie I've seen at the theaters in years and I love it. For those that see the holidays, X-mas especially, as the hypocritical, shallow and phony season that it is, this is their ""It's A Wonderful Life.""Billy Bob Thornton does a great job as Willie, an embittered and perpetually-drunk department store Santa who has no shame, sympathy or scruples. His elf sidekick Marcus, played by Tony Cox, isn't much better but he hides it well and doesn't urinate in his tiny green pants. Willie and Marcus, along with Marcus's greedy wife, pull vault heists at malls every year at x-mas. Marcus uses his size to find a way to hide or get into the mall and disable the security system and Willie, if he isn't too drunk, cracks the safe. Marcus's wife drives the van and spends the rest of the year filling out lists of expensive items for Marcus to steal for her.There is a tremendous suspension of disbelief as we watch Willie curse and drink and smoke and urinate all while sitting in Santa's chair, smack-dab in the middle of the mall in front of a long line of fawning children. But he never seems to get fired or even severely reprimanded. Especially not by spineless mall manager Bob Chipeska, played by John Ritter (what a movie to go out on!). Oh, Bob tries to get rid of Willie and Marcus, even going so far as to have his security chief (Bernie Mac) dig up dirt on Willie.Unbelievably, he can't find a thing. I guess smelling of booze and urine while yelling obscenities at kids just isn't grounds for firing like it used to be. But this sets up some of the best scenes with Mac and Cox butting heads, um, as it were. Gin the security chief figures out the scam though and wants in and that's where Marcus decides to take matters into his own hands.If that doesn't sound wrong enough for you, there's the additional character of ""the kid,"" played by Brett Kelly. Though fat and awkward, he seems to have a single-minded goal of befriending Thornton's dark Santa Claus. He is taunted and pelted with cans by skate punks. He is yelled at and called stupid by Santa. He cuts his hand and is given a wedgie but he is undeterred by his quest to get closer to the smelly, drunken, obscene man in the red suit.This movie continues it's twisted sleigh-ride through the crusty, grey snow right up until the extremely dark conclusion on x-mas night.

Thorton makes his character so believable, however ridiculous. I think that Bernie Mac was miscast in his part.  The ending was quite weak.

His partner in crime is a small black elf and together they make a very odd (and at times hilarious) couple. Their love/hate relationship is clear and they combine for some serious laugh out loud moments.Bob Thornton once again shows his versatility and puts on a great performance but is almost outshone by the lead boy in the film, who is both lovable and funny. This film turns out not only to be funny, but very touching and moral and leaves the viewer feeling very good about themselves.One criticism is that the plot is quite predictable but it does make good viewing and i recommend it for a good laugh.

If you think the concept of a drunken Santa vomitting, passing out, pissing himself, and swearing at kids can sustain some 90 minutes of cinema you might enjoy this, otherwise the mildly amusing idea dies after 10 minutes - and that's pushing it. Not only is it not funny, it's completely implausible and ultimately cloyingly sentimental. Don't think I'm some highbrow. I enjoyed ""Dodgeball"" I enjoy the Farrelly Brothers, I like slapstick, I like ""near the knuckle"" humour, I swear too. I've even been known to laugh at Jim Carrey (ok, it was a long time ago).

Simply Brilliant!This is certainly not a movie for children, but then it was never intended to be. If you like your comedy dark and your sentiment genuine then i truly believe you will fall in love with Bad Santa - just like the always pleasing Lauren Graham did.

Tony Cox and Billy Bob Thornton are both decent actors and could probably do a good comedy together if given the chance but your first clue this isn't going to be one is John Ritter showing up on the screen and your second clue is Bernie Mac showing up to chew the scenery.There were 2 or 3 moments where I might have chuckled but only because I've been drinking. I only finished watching it due to insomnia and extreme boredom. In a more sober and less forgiving mood I am certain I would find this movie tedious and not worth a single guffaw.I learned that there is going to be a sequel. If enough people liked this movie for that to happen I need to find a different planet.,Bad Santa
405,dolfan0307,"Without the f-word, a Christmas Classic. With it, a flippin' riot.",8,8 May 2006,"I'll make this quick.This movie was absolutely hysterical. I saw it when I was probably 16, with my 53 year old dad and his mom who was about 85 at the time. We were all rolling in the aisles.Billy Bob Thornton was positively perfect for this role, and Bob Costas was right--the one thing missing from the Oscars that year was a nomination for Best Actor for him.Also, Thurman Murman is a name used for all chubby weird kids nowadays by anyone who saw it, and the kid (played by Brett Kelly) portrayed the character perfectly, whether he is just an outstanding young actor or is actually like that. Bernie Mac, Tony Cox, Lauren Graham, and John Ritter all have their moments, too, and frequently.The one thing that bothered me is the fact that if the ""f word"" wasn't used so frequently in the movie, the film would have been a Christmas Classic, because it is extremely sweet. But with it, it carries a lot of swagger. Take it as it is, either way, and you'll be entertained. It is a damn good movie, and I have yet to meet someone that did not like it a hell of a lot.",Bad Santa
406,soujiro14,"""Are you f**king with me?!""",10,29 June 2005,"This movie was great. As a comedy, even greater. Billy Bob = gold. Tony Cox = gold. Brett Kelly = gold. I notice a lot of people said ""you shouldn't take your kids to see this"". I'd like to say THE MOVIE IS EFFING RATED R!!! Telling people that their kids shouldn't see this is redundant! Thank you, you masters of stating what is already in front of our eyes, in crisp, clear, living color. Anyway, back to the movie. I'm a big fan of profanity, so that worked in my favor. Eff the PC bulls**t. People want everything to be clean and the fact of the matter is that nothing is perfect. If you can stomach the profanity, you may enjoy it...a lot!",Bad Santa
407,carolyn130,Disgusting offensive child abusive film in the guise of entertainment,1,28 November 2015,"This is a really offensive ignorant film that should appeal to mindless corrupted individuals. Why good actors would appear in a film that clearly abuses children by exposing them to bad language, bad motives, bad behavior of the worst sort and have children in the film is anyone's guess? I am convinced all the writers were in their early teens, 14-15 year old boys who think of nothing but sex and every way to demean human kind. It takes a really sick mind, Willie, is a good example, to come up with this mess and think it's entertaining and worth the charge of admission. I would only recommend this film as a case example of what you should not try to pass off on an unsuspecting public as a Christmas film. Sick.",Bad Santa

409,zeroverse,One of my Favorite Movies,10,13 August 2008,"I don't rate many movies 10 out of 10. But honestly, I think this is one of the best movies ever made in its genre. It is profoundly well written and extremely hilarious (if you like dark humor). Above that, it has excellent characters that come alive through the finely crafted story. There isn't a single scene that doesn't develop character or move the plot forward (or make you laugh your ass off). In the end, the film is poignant and touching and probably will be for decades to come. I have watched this movie at least ten times, and each time I laugh...and revel over just how great this movie is. Believe me, when you compare this comedy to most other ""comedies"" released today, there just isn't a comparison. Bad Santa is brilliant.Yes, the movie is vulgar and may even be truly offensive to some more sensitive types. But if you enjoy sharp uncensored black humor...you are going to LOVE this movie like I did (and still do).Enjoy!",Bad Santa
410,michael-1482,cracking film,9,11 September 2005,"i felt the need to comment on this film as one of the original user comments was unfair in my view i found the film hilarious as did many of my English friends some of the content is real life there is sick people out there that do thieve and rob people on one of the most famous and enjoyable days of the year so i cannot understand how some American from new york thinks otherwise some examples fat kids do get bullied through their school life evil people do rob others during xmas, very renound in uk for peoples houses being burgled during xmas period so if anyone wants to watch this film and has been put off by his comments then ignore him !!! you will find the black comedy and evil humour hilarious and touching",Bad Santa
411,msp_008-1,This caused the most surreal Christmas ever at our house!,10,27 December 2005,"We mistakenly purchased this to watch with our family on Christmas day, believing it to be a heart warming family film. After the first minute we realised how wrong we were! This film is hilarious and was criminally over looked in the UK where it was given zero publicity for some reason. I thought it was fantastic from the beginning. Our older relatives were shocked by the first half of the film, but half way through it does start to become genuinely heart warming and you do become desensitised to the amount of bad language and sex.The ending had us all crying and we all agreed it was the best Christmas film we had ever seen, genuinely moving because of its realism and ability to be funny and tackle issues at the same time.It might not be the most 'traditional' of Christmas films. i.e. it isn't cheesy, but it certainly brought our family together! Rent it, watch it, buy it!",Bad Santa
412,nathansgreat,Worse than getting hit by a bus,1,28 December 2005,"I got about 30 min into this movie before I had to turn it off. If I had been in a high-rise building, I surely would have lept out of the window after lighting myself on fire. I would rather get AIDs from a 80 year old Vietnam veteran with one leg and an eyepatch than have to see any part of this movie ever again. If you think highly of this movie, you have clearly escaped from a state penitentiary, and ought to get scurvy. I hope that Billy Bob Thorton gets ravaged by a pack of dogs, hit by a bus, and then spends the rest of his life in a trailer park married to a woman named Dan raising 7 malnourished babies. If we lived in Japan, everyone who had anything to do with this movie would take the honorable path and kill themselves. I think I would rather drink a whole cup of ball sweat than watch this film again. If you are the kind of person who enjoys these flicks, then you also probably like to stomp on little babies.",Bad Santa
413,tyezil1,"Bad Sant, Bad movie",1,25 December 2005,"This by far is one of the most awful movies I've ever seen. The movie was mostly crude, and had very few laughs which disappointed me because I was told this movie was very funny. I guess you can't always go by what other people tell you. The acting was horrible. My husband said to me, ( Who told you that this movie was funny? Were they even watching the same movie that we just saw?)I just can't figure this out. Why anyone would recommend this movie is beyond me. I would not recommend this movie, and I will tell people straight up to not waist their time. I'm a Billy Bob Thorton fan, but this had to be a low moment for him in his career.",Bad Santa
