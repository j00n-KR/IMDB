0,MartinHafer,"Once again, Hollywood ignores the source material....and don't call this ""Get Smart""",4,17 May 2009,"While I was never a huge fan of the TV show ""Get Smart"", I did see plenty of episodes as a kid and am more than familiar with the show. Apparently, that is a lot more that can be said about the writers of this movie. Once again, Hollywood has made a film that bears very little similarity with the source material...other than the title and the names of the characters. So, at the outset, those who DO want to see a remake of the TV show are going to be rather disappointed. The problem I see is much like the problems with the ""Mission:Impossible"" films. The old shows were very plot driven, but with both these movie remakes, the movies are mostly driven by amazing special effects. The problem is, that these special effects have nothing to do with the show and the entire spirit of the source material is missing.As for Maxwell Smart, he is also quite different from the TV version. Don Adams' version was a guy who was essentially a lucky moron. Steve Carell's version is clumsy, but he's also a genius at interpreting data and forecasting enemy action. A smart Maxwell Smart?!?! What gives?! In addition, Chaos and Siegfried are smart and very dangerous, Agent 99 is a macho killing machine and all the humor and gentleness of the show is gone.So, to enjoy the film it really is best that you are young...very young. Otherwise, you will be confused and irritated by the whole thing. I teach high school, and several of the kids liked the film-- as it was clearly aimed only at them and people about their age. For anyone else, don't bother.",Get Smart
1,bkoganbing,Secret agent man,6,29 September 2015,"Get Smart for its time on television was a tremendously funny satirical show with so many catchphrases coming from the creative mind of Mel Brooks. Every one of them at some point makes it into this film. Sadly we don't have Don Adams and Barbara Feldon as the stars as the situations and dialog from the show became so much a part of American culture in the early Sixties. Taking the place of Adams and Feldon are Steve Carrell and Anne Hathaway who are like a road company version of Maxwell Smart and Agent 99. It is especially not Carrell's fault, that crisp delivery was uniquely Don Adams and just cannot be duplicated.Playing the Chief of CONTROL is Alan Arkin and in this film Maxwell Smart is not an agent, yet. He's an analyst and in the pecking order of the agency he and his fellow analysts are inferior beings to agents like Dwayne Johnson. But a security leak has compromised CONTROL's agents with many of them killed. Arkin has no choice but to promote Maxwell Smart and make him an agent in their never ending battle against CHAOS.In the meantime CHAOS goes into the nuclear terror business and it's up to in the end Maxwell Smart and 99 to bring them down. Do you doubt they succeed?Get Smart is a funny film, but Don Adams cannot be replaced.",Get Smart
2,SnoopyStyle,badly misses Brooks/Henry,6,12 November 2013,"Based on the TV show, Maxwell Smart (Steve Carell) is a diligent analyst who aspires to be a secret agent. He's worked hard and finally on the verge of becoming a field agent. Except the Chief (Alan Arkin) decide that he's too good of an analyst. Then command is attacked and Maxwell is sent out partnered with Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway).All the actors are game for this reboot but it doesn't take enough risks for the laughs. It badly misses Mel Brooks and Buck Henry to inject a sense of ridiculousness into the movie. Steve Carell has some funny moments. Anne Hathaway is a little too cold. Dwayne Johnson is actually a great super agent. But the jokes are unimaginative. Most of the best ones like the cone of silence is derived from the TV show. It's just not enough.Then it goes into a big Bond-like story the second half and the stunts overshadow any humor. By the end, the wacky humor is so buried that even baring his butt doesn't get Carell much of a laugh.",Get Smart
3,kosmasp,Clever,9,29 August 2008,"From the get go, I have to point out, that I haven't watched the original TV Series, so I can't say how true to the original (spirit of the) TV Show the movie is ... But I can say, that this is one great piece of (comedy) movie! After the misfire (Evan Almighty), Steve Carrell once again shows that he can carry a movie! Yes he has wonderful actors (Anne Hatheway has probably the most difficult role to play, because she is the ""straight"" one in this, meaning she has to be serious to ground Carrells hyper playing), but it is Carrell from start to finish! Great (sometimes awkward) humour, which might have characters that are funny, but always treats everyone on screen with an equal amount of ""respect"" ... Highly recommendable!",Get Smart
4,lee_eisenberg,Long live wacky espionage!,9,5 November 2019,"Back in the '60s, Mel Brooks and Buck Henry created a parody of the era's spy-themed movies and shows. ""Get Smart"" ran for five seasons, depicting the exploits of a brave but incompetent spy. In 2008, we finally got a movie version (although I only now got around to seeing it). Steve Carell took on the role of the bumbling Maxwell Smart, while Anne Hathaway took on the role of the sleek Agent 99. In this outing, the pair has to stop a terrorist plot (after all, the story had to get updated for the 21st century). I figured that there was going to be a fair amount of silly stuff, and I was right. There's crude humor, but also some sexy stuff; just look at Anne Hathaway's outfits!The rest of the cast includes Alan Arkin and Dwayne Johnson. This is the sort of movie where you shouldn't expect anything hyper-intellectual. The point here is to have fun, and there's no shortage thereof. You're sure to enjoy every minute of the movie.So yes, would you believe?",Get Smart
5,Tweekums,Entertaining spy comedy,8,22 June 2017,"Max Smart is an analyst for the US spy agency CONTROL. He yearns to become a field agent and after eight years has finally passed the test but has to face disappointment when told that he is too good an analyst to be made an agent. The situation soon changes when agents from Kaos, a foreign agency, attack and steal details of all active agents. That leaves just two people to go into the field and foil their plot; Smart and 'Agent 99', an agent whose details haven't been updated since her plastic surgery. Evidence suggests that agents of Kaos, under the leadership of 'Siegfried', have stolen a quantity of Uranium so Max and Agent 99 are sent to Russia to investigate. It won't be easy though; there is a mole in CONTROL and KAOS has some particularly tough agents.When I picked this up I was expecting something similar to 'Johnny English' with a fairly incompetent protagonist who ultimately prevails in spite of his stupidity. Actually it is quite different, there are some slapstick moments but for the most part he is skilled if somewhat naïve. The central story is solid and not inherently silly. There is a fine mix of comedy and action with neither being sacrificed at the expense of the other. Max Smart is a solid and likable protagonist, Steve Carell does an impressive job in the role. He is ably supported by Anne Hathaway, who is a lot of fun as Anent 99; Alan Arkin, who plays his short tempered boss and Dwayne Johnson, who plays 'super-agent' 23. Terence Stamp makes a good villain and Dalip Singh is a lot of fun as a henchman who is clearly inspired by Jaws from the James Bond films. The action scenes are exciting and wouldn't be out of place in a non-comedy action film aimed at the same demographic. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of the secret agent genre who want a good laugh; it is suitable for anybody old enough to enjoy Roger Moore era Bond films; which in many ways in resembles.",Get Smart
6,moonspinner55,"""Sorry about that, Chief!"" ...not as sorry as audiences will be",1,12 February 2011,"The 1960s television spy-spoof, created by Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, gets a big-budget, high-tech makeover...it worked for ""Charlie's Angels"", right? Cheerless, disastrous 'comedy' has Steve Carell in Don Adams' shoes as Agent 86, an analyst for CONTROL who gets his first field assignment: infiltrating Russia under the guise of a tourist and investigating KAOS for nuclear weaponry. His partner is Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway), who has just had a face-lift (!) and so won't be recognized by KAOS operatives (I would think her ultra-modern defense moves would surely give her identity away). Unfunny, over-produced, mean-spirited, and offensive. Carell attempts to bring his dryly-disengaged brand of nerdy-cool humor from TV's ""The Office"" to the big-screen, however he fails to click with Hathaway or, indeed, any other member of the cast. NO STARS from ****",Get Smart
7,Quinoa1984,"this works because of two things: Steve Carell, and Mel Brooks inspired zaniness, among some minor factors",7,22 June 2008,"Get Smart is fun stuff, and a lot of it can be credited to its star, Steve Carell. If you find this guy funny, you'll like the movie, it's about that close to simplicity. What's great about what he does in the role is that he doesn't so some retread of the original character on the old Get Smart TV show, but makes it all his own. 'His own' in that he injects what many of us love about him on the Office; this is basically Michael Scott as a secret spy running missions across the world. This means that he's not exactly bumbling, or even too stupid, on the contrary he's actually usually pretty smart and surprises everybody (mostly Agent 99 played by sexy Anne Hathaway) with his intelligence. He's not a simple buffoon, but someone who keeps fouling up along the way but somehow staying oddly lovable in his tomfoolery and one-liners. Carell's a master at this stuff.The director Peter Segal, however, works with a predictable work-plan. Get Smart doesn't have that ingenious of a plot, and matter of fact pretty much all of the plot twists are predictable. Get Smart doesn't work for plot but for character and over-exaggeration, and for a certain zaniness that we can all thank to the Godfather of modern spoof comedy, Mel Brooks. While he was only the co-creator of the original series (and a ""consultant"" credited alongside Buck Henry), his influence can be felt in the best parts of Get Smart. Aside from certain bits of comedy that are simply raunchy and crazy (to list all would go on too long for this review), there are just things like certain names (the one that stuck with me was Nudnuk Shpilkis, which is hilarious if you can get the Yiddish present), or in possible one-liners delivered with deadpan accuracy (I fell on the floor laughing at an Alan Arkin line regarding a swordfish through a windshield).What Segal might lack in direction then, the actors and the spirit, if not the body and mind, of Brooks come to the rescue for the proceedings. It's always amusing if not laugh-out-loud stuff, and the spirits are always high and cool even when things could get sluggish with the story. Bottom line, when you get Bill Murray in a bit part as an lonely agent working out of a tree, you know you're in good hands.",Get Smart
8,tavm,This version of Get Smart is very enjoyable as summer entertainment,8,23 June 2008,"With the choice this weekend among the new summer flicks between Mike Myers' The Love Guru (whose trailer made me cringe) and Steve Carell's updated version of Mel Brooks' and Buck Henry's Get Smart (whose trailer made me laugh quite heartily throughout), I picked the latter and it hardly even missed it by THAT (the equivalent of the beloved TV show's quality) much. Despite some changes in characterization and having more elaborate action scenes than you'd expect from a comedy, this Get Smart is a fine tribute to the series that made icons of Don Adams, Barbara Feldon, Edward Platt, and, in some scene stealing episodes, Bernie Kopell (who does a funny cameo here). Carell, Anne Hathaway, Dwayne Johnson (no longer The Rock), and Adam Arkin jell in their roles with many of their supporting cast also doing well here (An exception would be the Bill Murray cameo but it's nice to see him outside of his recent arty projects of late). All the familiar lines and scenes are here and I loved the updated opening entrance sequence and the more electronic code of silence-that-still-is-proved-useless joke. There's also some nice surprises about who's bad and who's good that I won't reveal here and how a little more intelligent Smart happens to be though he still is his clumsily lovable self. Ms. Hathaway is definitely a hottie here and I wish there was more than a second of her in her bra and panty just before she covered them with her robe! Mr. Johnson continues to amaze me with the way he's willing to let himself take risks with his roles and Mr. Arkin is absolutely amazing handling both straight and funny lines equally well. So along with Kung Fu Panda, Get Smart is a fine and engrossing comedy of this summer that should please anyone who loves well-rounded entertainment.",Get Smart
9,edwagreen,Get Smart Becomes More Stupid **,4,6 December 2008,"Perhaps, we're older and more mature so the funny lines of the television show of years before have become less appealing. With Don Adams and Edward C. Platt (now both gone), we also come to realize how good they were along with Barbara Feldon, Bernie Koppel and others on the hit show.This film doesn't hold a candle to the original television show. The jokes are amateurish at best and the first 40 minutes or so are quite boring.Several possibly funny scenes are not really funny at all. The one I'm referring to is where Agent 86 (Steve Carell) is dancing with that very heavy Russian lady. That scene could have been so much funnier especially when the dipping occurred in the dance.As far as Anne Hathaway, as 99, she is obnoxious to say the least. In the first part of the film, she is almost an adversary to Maxell Smart, trying to cut him off at every opportunity.The film shows some life once the real plot is revealed and KAOS threatens to dislodge a bomb in Los Angeles. The excitement builds, but when you think back of the television show, all is really lost. Even Al Arkin, as the leader of CONTROL, is relatively lost in this very disappointing production.",Get Smart
10,wes-connors,Missed it by THAT Much!,4,27 January 2012,"The Cold War may be over, but clueless CONTROL agent Steve Carell (as Maxwell ""Max"" Smart) is still battling Russians from KAOS. After some plastic surgery, sexy Anne Hathaway (as 99) teams up with Mr. Carell (aka 86) to stop the chaos, against the better judgment of spy boss Alan Arkin (as ""Chief""). Carell likes Ms. Hathaway, but romance will have to take a back seat. Would you believe the weight of the entire free world hangs in the balance? How about Los Angeles, where a bomb is hidden? Watch out for new agent Dwayne Johnson (as 23) as he's got a secret...""Get Smart"" is a feature-length re-make of the 1960s spy spoof TV comedy. Aside from the names and basic situation, the satirical characters created by Mel Brooks and Buck Henry are altered almost beyond recognition. The hapless spy originally played by Don Adams always seemed comically out of his element; here, he sometimes seems like an ass. Moreover, ""Max"" is made into an ""action"" star due to the bigger budget. Lovely to look at, Hathaway's kick-boxing ""99"" ventures far from the feminine intellect originally characterized by Barbara Feldon. It's got some good stunts.**** Get Smart (6/19/08) Peter Segal ~ Steve Carell, Anne Hathaway, Alan Arkin, Dwayne Johnson",Get Smart
11,BandSAboutMovies,Not that bad,6,11 February 2019,"Peter Segal has made films that people love - Tommy Boy, 50 First Dates, The Nutty Professor II: The Klumps - and critics hate. Here, he's remaking the Mel Brooks and Buck Henry show that ran from 1965 to 1970. Instead of Don Adams, Steve Carrell takes over as Maxwell Smart.Smart is more geek than spy, in awe of agents like 23 (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) and 99 (Anne Hathaway). Once KAOS (none of the spy agencies are acronyms here) exposes the identities of every CONTROL agent, he gets his chance to be a spy, going to battle with Siegfried (Terence Stamp!), one of the baddies from the 60's show. It's also great to see Alan Arkin as the Chief.There are some fun cameos here, like Bill Murray as Agent 13, who must always be a tree); James Caan as the President; Terry Crews and David Koechner as CONTROL agents; Larry Miller and Kevin Nealon as CIA guys; former WWE wrestler The Great Khali as a henchman and Patrick Warburton as the robotic Hymie.A sequel has been rumored for some time. There was a direct-to-video spin-off, Get Smart's Bruce and Lloyd: Out of Control (featuring the tech geeks, Warburton, Crews and a cameo by Hathaway). It only lasted seven episodes. It was based on the reunion movie, Get Smart, Again!I totally forgot that there was a 1995 Fox series with Don Adams and Barbara Feldon returning to their roles to help their son, Andy Dick, become a CONTROL agent.I did not forget 1980's The Nude Bomb, a film that brought Maxwell Smart back in again to battle a bomb that takes off clothes. Smart doesn't even work for CONTROL in this one, but for the PITS. Agent 99 isn't in it and Feldon wasn't even informed that the movie was being made. You know who is? Sylvia Kristel, which probably explains why an 8-year-old me was so excited by this film. Actually, I have no idea if pre-puberty me would know how magical she was, but I'd like to think I knew what was up. It's directed by Clive Donner, who was behind the TV movie Spectre and 1981's Charlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon Queen, a movie that would never be made today because Peter Ustinov was Chan and Angie Dickinson was the Dragon Queen. Whitewashing has been real for years, people.",Get Smart
12,studioAT,A great comedy,8,13 August 2010,This film captures enough of the spirit of the original series while also re-establishing the characters that have become so loved for a new audience.The comedy is perfectly pitched and the jokes come at a fast pace. The plot though not simple is not too dark and allows the characters and their relationships to take centre stage.Steve Carell again proves what a great comic actor he is by making the character of Maxwell Smart a lovable buffoon who we can laugh at but also root for. Anne Hathaway brings a lot of natural beauty and charm to the role of 99 and her chemistry with Carell is one of the high points of the film. Alan Arkin and James Caan also put in strong performances as the chief and the president. Overall a fantastic film that can be enjoyed by those who watched and loved the original Mel Brooks series and those who are discovering the series and the characters for the first time.,Get Smart
13,sunwarrior13,An Ordinary Film,7,28 September 2012,"Get Smart is a spy comedy film based on Mel Brooks and Buck Henry's 1960's spy parody TV series of the same title. It stars Steve Carell as Maxwell Smart and Anne Hathaway as Agent 99. Alan Arkin, who also worked with Carell in Little Miss Sunshine, plays the Chief.The film co-stars Dwayne Johnson, Terence Stamp, Terry Crews, David Koechner, Masi Oka, David S. Lee, Ken Davitian, Larry Miller, James Caan, Kevin Nealon, Patrick Warburton and Dalip Singh. Bernie Kopell, who played Siegfried in the original series, Leonard B. Stern.It was directed by Peter Segal.The evil geniuses at KAOS have hatched a diabolical plot to dominate every living man, woman, and child on the planet, and their plot gets under way as they attack the headquarters of the U.S. spy agency Control. As a result of the attack, the identity of every agent working for Control has been compromised. Realizing that the only way to thwart KAOS' evil plan is to promote eager but inexperienced Control analyst Maxwell Smart to the rank of special agent, the Chief reluctantly teams Smart with Agent 99, a veteran super-spy whose beauty is only surpassed by her lethality. With no real field experience to speak of and nothing but sheer enthusiasm and a handful of fancy spy gadgets to help him accomplish his deadly mission, Maxwell Smart his new partner, Agent 99, will be forced to faces malevolent KAOS head Siegfried and his loyal army of minions in a decisive fight that will determine the fate of the free world.Get Smart certainly has its moments, but suffers badly from an inability to balance the surreal humor and life-threatening terrorist threat.Also,it just turned out to be an ordinary film despite of the cast involved.",Get Smart

15,dbborroughs,Funny big screen take on a classic TV series suffers from an odd mix of silly comedy and realistic action but is mostly just a great deal of fun,7,29 June 2008,"Odd mix of silly humor (ala the original series) and huge scale action set pieces (think any summer blockbuster) is a very good but just misses being great big screen restart.In this new film Smart is a CONTROL analyst waiting to see how his field test scores stack up. as an analyst he is so good that when the scores come in the Chief refuses to promote him for fear of losing a valuable asset. However things change and he's forced into the field when KAOS comes in and pretty much kills everyone in control.Odd mix of humor and action doesn't always work. to be certain the comedy is often very funny and the action (the finale) is spectacular but the shift between silly and serious never quite meshes.I can't blame the cast since they are pretty spot on with Steve Carell nicely walking the fine line between idiot and hero. The only one I wasn't thrilled with was Terrence Stamp as Siegfried who is much too low key for all that is going on around him. (His role in Wanted was so much better suited to his talents). Odd meshing or not it still entertains, especially once the film gets up and running.There really isn't much more to say than that. To be certain it's better than many of this summer big touted blockbusters, particularly Wanted, another big budget action film its competing against at the box office.",Get Smart
16,zardoz-13,"""Get Smart"" Rarely Gets Funny",4,2 July 2008,"Comedian Steve Carell steps into the shoes of the clueless character Agent 86 that three-time Emmy winner Don Adams immortalized in the vintage NBC-TV sitcom ""Get Smart"" (1965-1970) with the new, big-screen adaptation of ""Get Smart"" co-starring Anne Hathaway as Agent 99 and Dwayne Johnson as Agent 23. Comparatively, the new ""Get Smart"" has more smarts but less slapstick than the classic ""Get Smart."" Although the original TV show's creatorsMel Brooks and Buck Henrywere consultants, ""Anger Management"" director Peter Segal's ""Get Smart"" shares little in common with the landmark comedy apart from incidentals like the multiple slamming doors at CONTROL headquarters, the faulty 'cone of silence,' and Smart's signature lines. ""Failure to Launch"" scenarists Tom J. Astle of and Matt Ember and Segal don't shtick to the ""Get Smart"" formula. Instead, they have super-sized this secret agent spoof into an over-the-top summer-time blockbuster action farce.In the world of international espionage, a rival CIA outfit named CONTROL wages an eternal war with a KGB clone called KAOS. The most diabolical KAOS agent, Siegfried (Terence Stamp of ""The Limey""), has obtained a nuclear arsenal and wants to blow a George W. Bush-style President (James Caan of ""Eraser"") to smithereens at a classical music concert in Los Angeles. Before Siegfried follows through with his plans, he launches a surprise raid on CONTROL's Washington HQ and learns the identities of all CONTROL agents. The Chief of CONTROL (Alan Arkin of ""Inspector Clouseau"") gives Agent 86 Maxwell Smart (Steve Carell of ""The Office"") a break and puts him in the field. Reluctantly, Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway of ""Havoc"") partners up with him, and they masquerade as man and wife on a mission into Russia. During the flight, Max tries to burn gum off his shoe, and everybody mistakes him for a terrorist lighting a shoe bomb. Actually, the far superior farce ""Harold & Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay"" got greater mileage out of this joke earlier this summer than ""Get Smart"" manages. Agent 99 worries about Max because he lacks experience. Brawny but debonair Agent 23 (Dwayne Johnson of ""Doom"") accompanies our heroes to unmask a traitor within CONTROL and save the President.The question arises about why Warner Brothers revived this classic sitcom and then ignored its surefire formula. Worse, the new ""Get Smart"" qualifies as one of the most unusual prequels on record! Officially, according to a tour guide, Congress dismantled the original CONTROL, which employed Maxwell Smart in the 1960s, at the end of the Cold War. Nevertheless, the agency still maintains its global intelligence network on the sly. When ""Get Smart"" starts, Maxwell Smart isn't a field agent! He analyzes intelligence chatter and fantasizes about being a field operative. The new ""Get Smart"" has rewritten history so Max never worked for CONTROL in the 1960s. Consequently, the new Max barely resembles the old Max. The new Max is an ambitious, nice guy, computer nerd, while the old Max was an oblivious buffoon like Inspector Clouseau in the ""Pink Panther"" movies.The adage: 'if ain't broke, don't fix it' applies to the new ""Get Smart."" The original ""Get Smart"" was a comedy of errors with its cretinous undercover agent blundering from one predicament to the next. Segal and his scenarists have reinvented the formula from the floor up. Sometimes, their alterations don't fare as well. For example, before Max joins the ranks as a CONTROL field agent, he languished for an eternity as an analyst. Moreover, we learn in this complicated, overripe revival of the show that Max struggled but eventually conquered his obesity. Undoubted, Segalwho helmed ""The Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps""probably contributed this gag. Steve Carell looks funny in a fat suit, but the humor adds little to the action. Max's best scene involves the disintegration of a bead curtain.Steve Carell delivers a tight-lipped deadpan performance as Max. He utters all of Max's trademark catchphrases. ""Would you believe?"" ""Missed by that much!"" ""Sorry about that Chief."" Occasionally, Carell acts like a hopeless klutz and does things that backfire in disaster, such as clobbering the Chief with a fire extinguisher The new Max, however, has been tailored more to fit Steve Carell's personality than evoke the spirit of Don Adams. For example, Carell's Max resembles Jack Ryan from Tom Clancy blockbusters like ""Patriot Games"" and ""A Clear and Present Danger."" Carell's Max writes 400 to 600 page reports about intelligence chatter from eavesdropping spy satellites. Max draws astute conclusions from a conversation between two terrorists on a coffee & muffin break at a restaurant that impresses the Chief. Not everything the new Max does backfires on him.Those that never saw Don Adams play Maxwell Smart will probably enjoy this prequel. Unfortunately, the strenuous action scenes overshadow the sight gags. Segal and his scribes stole the skydiving stunt from the 007 movie ""Moonraker"" and another from the Sean Connery thriller ""Entrapment"" with Catherine Zeta Jones. The folks that made ""Get Smart"" need to get funny the next time. .",Get Smart
17,view_and_review,True to Form,7,30 October 2021,"""Get Smart"" the TV show predated me some, though I did watch reruns on Nick at Nite. It was then that I realized that he had to be the inspiration behind a show I did watch weekly: ""Inspector Gadget.""

18,george.schmidt,Would You Believe....? Not that bad ; Carell & Hathaway are an inspired dynamic duo,6,25 June 2008,"GET SMART (2008) **1/2 Steve Carell, Anne Hathaway, Dwayne Johnson, Alan Arkin, Terence Stamp, Terry Crews, David Koechner, James Caan, Bill Murray, Masi Oka, Nate Torrence, Ken Daviatan, David S. Lee, Patrick Warburton (cameo: Bernie Kopell) Hit-and-miss big-screen adaptation of the classic '60s TV spy-spoofing comedy with Carell brilliantly cast as Maxwell Smart, Agent 86 of CONTROL, a secret US spy organization , this time with Smart as an analyst-spy-in-training with the seasoned Agent 99 (the luscious Hathaway stepping silkily into Barbara Feldon's stilettos) leading him to stop KAOS kook Siegfried (spooky Stamp) from setting of an atomic bomb in Los Angeles. While the two leads have dynamite chemistry and do fine turns by their iconic predecessors with ease and finesse the script by Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember attempts to incorporate a ""Bourne Identity"" vibe that feels a bit off-putting for the bumbling Smart and director Peter Segal lets the pyrotechniques get a little out of hand; however I'd hope if there was a sequel they'd give more for equally inspiring Warburton as Hymie the Robot (a nice nod to the series' Dick Gautier) and Murray as Agent 13 (a glorified cameo at best), the colleague who shows up in the tightest of spots undercover, and speaking of cameos nice to see Kopell (the original Siegfried) but where was Feldon?! Missed her by that much!!",Get Smart
19,neil-476,Enjoyable comedy,8,28 August 2008,"I remember the original series - although only barely - and I seem to remember that Max was a complete idiot. In this movie, he isn't. A trifle odd, to be sure, and someone who tries a little too hard maybe, but he actually has some genuine skills and intelligence.The blend of slapstick, loveability, would-be-suaveness and actual suaveness isn't easy to carry off, but Steve Carell manages it effortlessly - he has a very sympathetic screen presence.Anne Hathaway is, thankfully, as hot an Agent 99 for the noughties as Barbara Feldon was for the 60s. This versatile young lady shows not only the welcome comedic touch we have come to expect, but some athletic flair in the action scenes. Plus she has great legs.The story is standard spy fare, but has some surprisingly decent action set pieces in it.Dwayne Johnson has apparently decided to be called Dwayne Johnson in movies. I can't help feeling that this is a sensible move. I never could come to terms with Mr and Mrs Rock deciding to call their son ""The."" Alan Arkin has fun. And so did I. There are some good laughs in this enjoyable spoof romp.",Get Smart
20,evanston_dad,Carrell Bumbles with the Best of Them,7,18 July 2008,"I imagine your opinion of ""Get Smart"" will depend greatly on your feelings about the TV sitcom on which it is based. I have never seen one episode of the series, so I greatly enjoyed the film. However, by all accounts, it differs greatly in tone from its predecessor and possibly won't satisfy purists.""Get Smart"" isn't that different from any number of disposable action products hauled out by Hollywood every summer to dazzle us (or at least stupify us) with big, loud effects. But it's refreshingly lighthearted and funny, with Steve Carrell delivering dead-pan one-liners even as he's trying to untangle himself from life-threatening situations. He plays bumbling doofus well, and if you think Carrell is funny in any other context, you'll probably find him funny here as well, since he never strays far from his standard schtick.Joining him, and offering some leggy diversion for the male audience, is Anne Hathaway, who plays a fellow but far more competent FBI agent. Hathaway is an appealing actress, and she and Carrell have quite a bit of chemistry together. The movie didn't need the love connection it foisted on the two characters (though the script offers a clever plot detail to make the age difference less icky), but apparently, its makers think that's what summer movie audiences want.Alan Arkin is also on hand, using that droll monotone to make everything he says funny, and succeeds in getting the film's biggest laugh.My only problem with ""Get Smart"" is one that I've had with several other movies this summer, and it is this. With Hollywood out of franchises, studio execs are obviously desperate to create new ones, and so they're giving us one movie after another that prepares us for a sequel, without making the one we're watching satisfyingly contained. Message to Hollywood: The way to get us to come back for more is to make sure the movies you're giving us now are actually good. Grade: B+",Get Smart
21,gridoon2021,"Exhilarating action, good comedy",7,20 June 2008,"The first 10 minutes or so of ""Get Smart"" are kind of disappointing, and I thought ""here we go, another trailer that makes the film look better than it is"". But it improves greatly after that point, mainly after the first encounter of Max with Agent 99. Anne Hathaway is in some ways the life of this movie: she is incredibly sexy, with a magnificent back and legs to die for (or by), and completely believable in all her action scenes. Steve Carell has good comic timing; he may at times remind you of Leslie Nielsen in ""The Naked Gun"" and ""Spy Hard"" mode, but beyond that he manages to make Max a genuinely likable and human character, not just a cartoon. The relationship Max and 99 have formed at the end of the movie seems to be based more on friendship than anything else. The rest of the cast is generally well-chosen (although I didn't get the point of Bill Murray's 1-minute cameo); there is a big plot twist that allows one cast member to play against type, and even Dalip Singh (aka The Great Khali in WWE) comes off well, playing a huge indestructible henchman in the tradition of Jaws of ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and ""Moonraker"".There are some good laughs in ""Get Smart"", but what pleasantly surprised me is how well-done the action is. From an exhilarating freefall sequence that was probably designed as a homage to the opening of ""Moonraker"" to Carell's and Hathaway's quick, efficient fight scenes (choreoghraphed by a veteran at this sort of thing, James Lew), and from the explosions at the ""bakery"" factory to the incredibly kinetic final chase sequence involving various means of transportation, the action in this movie probably surpasses the recent James Bond pictures, helped by the fact that a lot of it seems to have been done by the actors themselves, willing to take some risks. So people who are more into action than into comedy should still get some satisfaction out of this.Nothing brilliant, but a dependable crowd-pleaser nonetheless. I'd give it *** out of 4 stars.",Get Smart
22,Uriah43,Trying to Control Kaos,6,12 September 2018,"As a data analyst for the top-secret government agency known as Control, ""Maxwell Smart"" (Steve Carrell) has always wanted to be a secret agent. Unfortunately, he has failed the exam seven times in a row and when he learns that he finally passed is told by ""The Chief"" (Alan Arkin) that he is too valuable in his current position so he will not be recommended for the promotion. Needless to say this disappoints him but, after a devastating attack upon Control headquarters by the evil syndicate known as Kaos, the decision is reversed and Max becomes Agent 86. And his first mission involves working with ""Agent 99"" (Anne Hathaway) to recover some stolen yellow cake uranium by Kaos before they get the chance to make a nuclear bomb. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this movie definitely had its share of humorous scenes throughout the course of the film. I especially liked the performance of Dwayne Johnson (as ""Agent 23"") who I thought was simply hilarious. Likewise, having a sexy actress like Anne Hathaway certainly didn't hurt this film either. On the flip side, however, I have to admit that some of the jokes were rather stale and that I didn't especially care for the rather lengthy action scene at the end either. Be that as it may, however, I enjoyed this movie for the most part and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",Get Smart
23,ferguson-6,Would you believe ... CONTROL is back!,7,22 June 2008,"Greetings again from the darkness. Very pleasant surprise from director Peter Segal (""Anger Management"") in what is much more than a tribute to the great TV series. This is a terrific combination of comedy and action and will be fun for those who aren't even familiar with the original ... but even more fun for those who are! Steve Carrel is perfect as Agent 86 Maxwell Smart, a role made infamous by the late great Don Adams. Few comics today can deliver the straight punch line better than Carrel. Anne Hathaway is very good as Agent 99, a role Barbara Feldon was born to play. Would have liked to have seen a cameo from Feldon. Alan Arkin steps in as CONTROL chief for the late, great Edward Platt, who died much too soon. Terence Stamp is well cast as the evil leader of KAOS and the supporting cast includes David Koechner, Dwayne Johnson, Bill Murray and James Caan as the President. Patrick Warburton has an effective scene as Hymie, the first CONTROL robot agent ... played with panache in the series by the great Dick Gautier. Interesting to note that Caan also appeared in a couple of shows of the TV series, forty years ago.What really sets this one apart and allows it to stand on its own are two things. The action scenes and gadgets are actually pretty cool and the comedy writing is top notch. Great to see the red Sunbeam make an appearance and I was very anxious to see how the shoe phone was worked in. Speaking of worked in ... don't miss Bernie Kopell as the angry driver in a quick scene. We all remember his fine work from the TV series. Still, despite all the winks and tips of the cap to the original, what is most impressive is that Carell's and Hathaway's team stand on their own and make for quality action/comedy. Plus, it's still a great theme song. Mel Brooks and Buck Henry should be very proud ... their creation lives on!",Get Smart
24,anaconda-40658,Get Smart and See A Different Film.,3,9 July 2015,"Get Smart (2008): Dir: Peter Segal / Cast: Steve Carell, Anne Hathaway, Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson, Alan Arkin, Terence Stamp: Another comedy based on a TV show. This one regards positioning the one agent no one counted on, to solve a standard issue plot. Steve Carell plays Maxwell Smart who is promoted to spy agent for Control when enemy Kaos strikes. Director Peter Segal does well but screenplay is terrible. He previously directed the hilarious The Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult as well as the wretched Tommy Boy. This one seems to follow the dreadful delivery of the latter. Carell is ideal as Smart, who constantly screws up but unfortunately the role lacks depth and comes off as forced. Anne Hathaway does little more than be eye candy as agent 99. She is suppose to represent the brains of the duo but unfortunately she is merely an image for the hormones. Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson is wasted as the agent Smart envies. Alan Arkin is lifeless as the head of Control who is given next to nothing to do than provide conventional bore. Terence Stamp plays an extremely boring villain with nothing to offer let alone spoof the conventions like a Dr. Evil type. Visually the film seems to surpass its sitcom charade otherwise the film ultimately becomes nothing more than a TV remake. The best remedy for dealing with trash such as this is to get smart and avoid this travesty altogether. Score: 3 / 10",Get Smart
25,FlashCallahan,Personal Best.......,8,22 September 2012,"Maxwell Smart works for a Government spy agency in an administrative capacity. When the agency's head office is attacked, the Chief decides to assign Maxwell as a spy and partners him with Agent 99, much to her chagrin. The pair set off to combat their attackers by first parachuting off an aeroplane and landing in Russian territory - followed closely by a seven foot tall, 400 pound, known simply as Dalip. The duo, handicapped by Maxwell's antics, will eventually have their identities compromised, and may be chalked up as casualties while back in America their attackers have already planted a bomb that is set-up to explode in a concert....What should have been a complete failure is one of the surprises of 2008, thanks to Carrell and a simply brilliant performance by Hathaway. The chemistry between the couple is brilliant, and Carrell never really goes over the top in the way Ferrall may have in this role.Some of the jokes do fall flat and linger for far too long, but this is just a minor niggle for a film that is very funny and has a very good story too.The support is fantastic, especially from Johnson and Stamp, and the whole thing looks really slick, almost too slick at times.It goes to show that you don't have to be over the top to be funny, and the two leads prove that.

27,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Get Smart,10,22 June 2008,"When the movie was announced, I sort of celebrated the casting of Steve Carell. He resembled a bit like the late Don Adams (except for, pardon this, being a little wider on the girth), but nonetheless being the comedian as he was, I thought he would be perfect in the movie version, which served as a Redux of sorts in an updated re-telling (as I would prefer to imagine it to be) of sorts, as Maxwell is still an Analyst within CONTROL, and itching to get out as a field agent. So like James Bond's Casino Royale, we go back to basics, but yet retaining whatever's necessary for a modern audience to get chummy with the lead character. Even Barbara Feldon too got a cameo (even though through a photograph only), which weaved in perfectly for the movie version of Anne Hathaway to take over.Forget the Johnny English and Pink Panther remakes, which the former was trying hard to emulate past success stories from television series such as this one, and the latter being a tad more slapstick than it warranted. Get Smart the movie actually captured perfectly the essence of the television series, while yet paying it the respect of a series well done. I can't help but to tear a little as I see the car that Don Adam drove, the cell-phone shoe, the original cone of silence as well as what I would like to think as the original suit Adams donned in the series. All these get fitting tribute early in the film, before making way for Carell's version to take over.So what's appealing in the new movie? For starters, it played a lot on Maxwell Smart being Smart. In the series there was no question of him being a victim of circumstance with Lady Luck smiling on him, and here it managed to combine that with proper intelligence of his analyst background, so much so that The Chief (Alan Arkin) had to reject him being out in the field, but serving his organization by sieving through intelligence for their field agents. So our updated Smart actually has a lot more brains, and in the brawn department, he's not a pushover either.Then the story doesn't dumb down too much, and had quite an even keel in providing mass entertainment without condescending the audience. That, I felt, was quite difficult to achieve given that you're trying to make people laugh, and the temptation is there to slapstick everything to elicit a few cheap chuckles. So in trying to avoid situations like that, I tip my hat to. It's no rocket science of a story, but there's enough properly designed set action pieces to entertain, and not make it look all too stupid. It had its fair share of spoofs from Entrapment to mentions of peer movies like James Bond, down to even borrowing an obvious Jaws-like villain.But what really worked and made the movie special, was the chemistry between Carell and Hathaway. Just like how Adams and Feldon seemed so natural with each other, Carell and Hathaway worked wonders and brought back the magic as the Agents with a tinge of romantic / sexual chemistry between them. They have surely taken over the mantle and proved worthy of succeeding the original duo, and that's coming from a long time fan of the series myself. Supporting the duo are plenty of surprise casting like Bill Murray's short cameo as Agent 13, and David Koechner who I've mentioned before, is making some headway in recent comedies. The Rock had some pretty comical moments as well (I just loved his character's introduction) but the one who took the cake was James Caan's role as The President, modelled so clearly after George W Bush, and no holds barred mimicry of his reading to schoolchildren during a crisis, his mispronunciation of ""nuclear"" and plenty of other sight gags.In the villain department, they come naturally from KAOS, this time with Terence Stamp heading the organization as Siegfried and Ken Davitian as his sidekick Shtarker, and we learn that they have laid low since the Cold War ended. Now their diabolical plans include handing out nuclear weapons to states which are non-friendly to the USA, and with activation codes granted, there is no question where those bombs will be heading towards. Like the first Mission: Impossible movie, you won't need much time before you guess who the secret villain will be once he appears on screen as well.Boasting an excellent soundtrack which began with ABBA's Take A Chance On Me to Madonna's 4 Minutes, given the way things developed in the movie, I won't be surprised that there would be a sequel in store should the movie rake in strong takings from the box office. The chemistry's set up, and there are definitely more stories to tell, and I know I'll be in line for another go. This is one of the rare remakes/reboots/tributes done right, and it comes highly recommended. Should I not succeed in getting the original series on DVD, I'll probably be contended with this one on my shelves too!",Get Smart
28,Mr-Fusion,"Loaded with talent, but fairly stupid",5,14 July 2015,"Give the casting department on ""Get Smart"" some real credit, the actors in this movie are well-chosen (Steve Carell, Anne Hathaway, Dwayne Johnson and Alan Arkin, notably). For any of the movie's faults, these people make it a palatable experience. When this first came out, I liked it for the leads' chemistry (not to mention the hotness of Hathaway) and Arkin's got all the best lines, but on rewatch, it's on that that the movie coasts. There's an odd sense of humor on this thing; not just the forced diet jokes, but most of the funnies are very obvious. This is a breezy action comedy, and it's mostly harmless, but I didn't laugh very much. If they'd have just put the kind of effort into the humor that they did in the action scenes, we'd have something.5/10",Get Smart
29,namashi_1,Hilarious!,10,10 July 2010,"Some films are so spontaneous and memorable, that you enjoy them whenever you watch them. Seen 'Get Smart' back in 2008, in the cinema, I've ever since enjoyed the film thoroughly. Based on Mel Brooks and Buck Henry's 1960s spy parody television series of the same name, comes a joyride! 'Get Smart' gets it right from the beginning. Peter Segal's direction and his love for the subject is visible throughout. The film was a smash hit, and of course it deserved to be. It's a hilarious film from start to end. In fact, the film has left such a strong impression on me and my folks, that we, always watch 'Get Smart', when we want to get into a chirpier mood! Steve Carell's performance is no less of a milestone. The actor sinks his teeth into the character and brings it out like flying colors. Anne Hathaway has never looked so good before, she's looks a million bucks and her performance is excellent. Alan Arkin brings the house down with his dialog delivery and his execution to it. Terence Stamp is first-rate. Dwayne Johnson is simply superb. I've always been his fan! James Caan in a cameo, is efficient.'Get Smart' doesn't demand a 900-word review on IMDb, so my culmination to the review is: Must Watch For All Cinema Buffs! Two Thumbs Up!",Get Smart
30,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Not as funny as I was expecting, but still a fresh new comedy for the summer",7,26 June 2008,"Last year I saw the teaser trailer for Get Smart, Steve Carell throws a phone at the guy from Borat and it's on a wire and stops before it can hit him, I nearly died laughing and new I had to see this film. More and more trailers were released and this movie just looked more and more funny, I just couldn't wait to see it. I got to see it this week and I have to say that I was expecting this to be at least a nine out of ten rating. Steve Carell is such a great comedic actor and we had such a promising cast. Now I'm only 23 years old, so I haven't seen the series, but I know that it's a series that was made by Mel Brooks and was pretty popular back in the day, but I cannot judge it on what the series was. As a movie, I'd say it was good, as an all out comedy, I wasn't too thrilled. It has some really funny moments, I guess I've just seen all the screw ball comedies to the point where I am used to these stories by now.Maxwell Smart works with a secret agency, he's got the smarts, but not exactly the skill to be a secret agent. But when hot Agent 99 is on the case, Max is given a chance to work with her. They have to stop a terrorist who is threatening to blow up a building with the president. But with Max and Agent 99 on the case, Agent 99 being good at the skills, and Max at least having the brains, with the feelings they're doing their best to hide, they stick together and learn a few new tricks.Get Smart is a good movie, I would recommend it, I would more so would recommend though that you wait for the rental, the funny parts were already shown in the trailer unfortunately. The cast though was excellent and did make the movie work very well, the strange thing was is that Dwayne Johnson actually did a good job, he's proving more and more that he's a decent enough actor for the characters he's portraying. Another thing I did like is that they didn't make Max into a total idiot where he is like Steve Urkel or something. It's just too typical, Steve made Max into his own and the movie does still deliver good laughs, just I wish it could have been a little more.7/10",Get Smart
31,blanbrn,An okay and funny clever type spy spoof.,7,7 July 2008,"""Get Smart"" so far has been one of the better films out during this summer blockbuster season. You'll get plenty of laughs and feel good entertainment fun especially if you don't take the film to serious. As this picture is done in a neat and clever political satire way from legendary film greats Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, the film takes a theme of an updated homage to the 1960's hit sitcom. You have the funny Steve Carell as bumbling agent Maxwell Smart who takes on his assignments and adventures internationally that's similar to the Cold War days. The beautiful and sexy Anne Hathaway is simply a knockout as Smart's sidekick Agent 99 her character brings great sex appeal to the film. The movie is plenty clever and fresh at the same time not having to serious of action sequences and any comedy fan will enjoy them. So if your looking for a good film of fun that doesn't take things to serious and enjoy a good dose of self mockery then this nice little spy spoof ""Get Smart"" is a film to see!",Get Smart

33,sddavis63,Doesn't Even Come Close To The TV Series,2,16 December 2008,"Having been a big fan of the classic TV series from the 1960's I approached this movie with both anticipation and apprehension. I ended up being disappointed. I didn't expect it to live up to the series (so many of these movie remakes of the old TV series have truly disappointed) but on the other hand, while I'm not a huge fan of Steve Carell (and while no one could play Maxwell Smart like Don Adams did) I nevertheless thought that, based on Carell's past work, he could do a credible job with the part. Now, honestly, I can't blame Carell for my disappointment. He had to work with the script he was given. Somewhere, in the course of translating this from the 60's small screen to the 2008 big screen, someone forgot what made the TV series work. Maxwell Smart was the classic contradiction. He was the supreme bungler who was also the super spy. That was lost here. There was some attempt to maintain the bungler part (the scene in the airplane lavatory was truly funny) but rather than being a super spy, in this movie Smart was a rookie, a CONTROL analyst (the best they had, and, from the script, apparently a pretty good, detailed and thorough one - which just doesn't fit the character as I know Maxwell Smart!) just promoted to agent, teamed with the far more experienced (!) Agent 99. That bio of Agent 86 just didn't work for me. Someone also forgot that the TV series was just plain dumb fun from the beginning to the end of every episode. That fun was sorely lacking here. The story (revolving around a KAOS plot to obtain nuclear weapons and then blackmail the US government) seemed inconsistent and the acting was merely passable for the most part. There were a handful of funny scenes - and Anne Hathaway as Agent 99 was smokin' hot, especially as she worked her way around the laser beams - but, in the end, the biggest problem with this movie was that it just plain wasn't that funny. In fact, I fell asleep the first two times I tried to watch it, finally making it through to the end the third time. I hope they don't make a sequel. If I need another ""Get Smart"" fix, I'd rather stick with the Don Adams version! 2/10",Get Smart
34,Buddy-51,Dumbing Down Smart,4,9 July 2008,"For some reason, Hollywood seems intent on trashing virtually every fond pop culture memory we Baby Boomers have managed to hold onto from our increasingly distant childhoods. I mean, can any genuine fan of ""The Beverly Hillbillies,"" ""Bewitched,"" ""Lost in Space,"" et. al, really have anything but the utmost contempt for the big screen atrocities that have been spawned from those series? (""The Addams Family"" and ""The Brady Bunch"" are two of the obvious exceptions that prove the rule, I guess).The latest victim of that assault is ""Get Smart,"" Mel Brooks and Buck Henry's ingenious, Emmy-winning parody of James Bond that ran on network television from 1965-1970. The series recounted, in high style and with great good humor, the goofy misadventures of one Maxwell Smart, aka Agent 86, of the spy agency CONTROL who, in his own endearingly inept way, waged weekly battle against the comically evil organization known as KAOS. The series even contributed a whole litany of catch phrases (i.e. ""Would you believe?"" and ""Missed it by THAT much"") to the pop culture lexicon of the 1960's.For the bloated movie version of ""Get Smart,"" Max and his female sidekick, Agent 99, have become embroiled in a plot by KAOS to detonate a nuclear device in downtown Los Angeles (hey, didn't Hollywood just do this story in the movie ""Next"" last year?). One of the key problems with most of the big screen adaptations of these small screen successes is that the roles are often so inextricably linked with the actors who originally embodied them that the new performers can't help but come across as mere second-rate imposters in comparison. Steve Carell, for instance, is a fine comic actor who certainly resembles Don Adams in the looks department, but Carell's 86 is nowhere near as bumbling as he needs to be to make Maxwell Smart click as a character. Moreover, he lacks the signature double takes and distinctive voice inflections that Adams used to such brilliant effectiveness in creating the role. In short, for long stretches of time, Maxwell Smart has been reduced to playing straight man in his own movie.Anne Hathaway conveys a certain style and panache as Agent 99, but Alan Arkin as the Chief and Dwayne Johnson as Agent 23, though both very good, aren't accorded sufficient screen time to register much of an impact. The movie, which was written by Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember and directed by Peter Segal, is big and noisy and features the requisite number of car chases, explosions and special effects to keep action-movie audiences happy, but the comic ideas are threadbare and worn, and I dare say that not one of these alleged jokes would have made it past the quality-control gatekeepers in charge of the original series.Another one down, and we're pondering who's next up on the chopping block. ""Gilligan's Island""? ""The Partridge Family""? ""Green Acres""? ""I Dream of Jeannie""? One shudders at the thought.",Get Smart
35,bensonmum2,"""You heard me I have to 'squeeze the lemon'.""",4,23 September 2009,"Overall, I found Get Smart a disappointing experience. I guess I should have known I'd have problems with the movie – I usually do with these old TV shows turned into movies. The problem generally is that the people responsible for the remakes have no clue about what made the original so good and enjoyable. And that's the case here. Maxwell Smart is the centerpiece of Get Smart. His bumbling antics are what made it funny. Anyone familiar with the television show will go into the movie with a preconceived notion of how Steve Carrell should play the character. But thanks to some poor writing and directing, Carrell's Maxwell Smart is all over the map. One minute he's a bumbling fool incapable of the most simple of tasks (like cutting the plastic strap binding his wrist when he has a knife) and the next he's suddenly a super-hero busting the chops of every bad guy in sight. It's not just inconsistent – it's downright annoying. Add to that the half-hearted way the writers threw in Don Adams' familiar catch phrases, the over-reliance on fat jokes, the lazy way action is used to replace real comedy, and a plot that is tired on one hand and nonsensical on the other and you end up with 110 minutes of wasted opportunity. That's not to say it's all bad. I did enjoy Anne Hathaway as Agent 99 and Alan Arkin as . . . well, as Alan Arkin. However, they aren't enough to save Get Smart. I should have gone with my instincts and avoided this one.",Get Smart

37,Robert_duder,They really pull it off...this is a terrific homage to the original series and a jump start to a whole new Maxwell Smart,8,6 July 2008,"I got the pleasure of seeing ""Get Smart, Again"" with the original cast immediately before seeing this remake so I could kind of compare the two. Usually when a remake of an old TV series gets done it is butchered or made fun of or really has nothing to do with the original and the film makers and cast did such an incredible job doing justice to the original infamous series and the characters and at the same time they managed to give it a jump start into the new millennium so everyone can have fun with it. Professional critics couldn't have been more dead wrong about this film. They claimed that it doesn't mix the humor with the attempt at action and they are completely and utterly wrong. This movie does exactly that while staying in touch with the already established characters and fan base. Sure some of the fans out there will be upset to see anyone but Don Adams playing Maxwell Smart and they certainly add the obligatory toilet humor (which usually I hate...farts and bodily functions shouldn't still be funny nowadays) but it main streams the film and probably makes you laugh despite yourself. The thing is they really hit the jackpot because what makes this film so watchable and fun is exactly what made the series the same way so many decades ago.Let's talk Steve Carell who despite myself I have grown to appreciate and really enjoy on the big screen. He is absolutely amazing as Maxwell Smart. If any other human being could take over from Don Adams Steve Carell absolutely nailed it. He has the exact brand of humor that made Adams such an icon in the original role. His dead pan humor, his quick wit and his way of making campy seem so much fun. He leads this film with style and a complete homage to Maxwell Smart but with his own kind of flare to it. Anne Hathaway is probably not the ideal choice to be the Barbera Feldon 99 of yesteryear but she completely embraces a new snazzy, sharp, strong female 99 of now. She is great in her role and complete opposite of Carell and his Maxwell Smart and yet they truly have really great chemistry. Even their budding romance is terrific as strange as they seem a couple and they're comedic bantering and timing is terrific!! Alan Arkin makes for a decent chief. I think I expected a little more from him because he is more of an active agent kind of chief and they don't give him the same relationship with Max that the original series had. He still is good and fits in well it's just his character isn't what I expected. There was a time when I thought Dwayne Johnson was a real up and coming action star but now I'm kind of tired of him and I could have done without his new character role as Agent 23. He was okay and not in the film a lot but he was kind of unnecessary. Terence Stamp was terrific as lead Kaos agent Siegfried and played opposite Carell in a terrific way. There are a lot of small cameo roles including James Caan as The President, Bill Murray as Agent 13 (hiding in a tree) Patrick Warburton (who I was so excited to see as android Hymie because I thought he would be brilliant and was on screen less than five minutes sadly,) David Koechner who sadly is the one person who ruins his character from the original series as a smart talking, slimy acting Larabee. And a very quick cameo by Bernie Kopell who played Siegfried in the original series.Despite a very few lack luster performances the real weight of this movie hangs on the two main characters and they knock this one out of the park they are so watchable. The film is genuinely funny and had me laughing at loud time and time again. The action was not distracting as some critics suggest and it wasn't over the top explosions and guns blazing, it was just enough to make it a summer blockbuster kind of film. The dialog makes sure to pay plenty of attention to all the original running gags in the Get Smart series and I was smiling from ear to ear when Carell says ""Missed it by that much."" He was brilliant!! I am so pleased this film is doing well because I want to see the cast return again and again and hopefully they can continue to make Get Smart films as funny and clever and well written and acted as this one. This is a real gem for adults and kids of all kinds whether you've seen the show or not. It pays respects but modernizes it for the new generation. Bravo to all of them. 8.5/10",Get Smart
38,bowmanblue,Still not sure about this one,7,29 January 2015,"I'm writing this review after my second viewing of 'Get Smart.' When I first saw it, I wasn't exactly blown away. My overall opinion was that it was a film that couldn't make up its mind whether it wanted to be an action film or a comedy.Since then, I have got into the U.S. version of 'The Office' and really enjoyed Steve Carell's performance in that. Therefore, I thought I'd give the film another go to see if it's grown on me at all. Carell plays one of the 'backroom boys' who aids the American Secret Service. The film moves pretty swiftly the circumstances which elevate him to 'full field agent,' but, before long, he's on a mission to save the world with his sexy partner, played by Anne Hathaway.If you're thinking, 'This sounds a bit like Johnny English,' then you'd be right. Sort of. Johnny English was also a comedy based around a – slightly incompetent – secret agent. Only it was a total comedy. If you like that sort of humour you'd find it funny and pretty much laugh all the way through. However, 'Get Smart' seems to want to try and tell a 'spy story,' complete with world domination threat, car chases, fight scenes and double-crosses.Unfortunately, after sitting through it a second time, I can see why I forgot it. It's not bad. It's just not that good, either. Granted, there are some funny moments, but they never seem to come as often as I felt they should. Now I've watched The Office, I can basically see Steve Carrell is basically playing his small screen character 'Michael Scott,' only with a new job and slightly more capable at fighting. Only The Office is a comedy and there are more jokes in an average twenty minute episode than there are here.I didn't hate it. I just thought that it should have played to one strength or another. I don't regret watching it a second time, but I'm pretty sure it'll be my last time. Carell is and can be much funnier than he is here. I hear that Get Smart is based on a TV series and, having not seen that, I can't really compare the two. But, I think I'll stick to The Office instead.",Get Smart
39,MLDinTN,Steve Carell is a funny guy but this isn't a funny movie,4,17 May 2009,"This really wasn't a great movie. Anne Hathaway isn't cut out for this type of movie. I like Steve Carell but this really wasn't a comedy. It was more of a sillyish spy/adventure film. Carell plays Max Smart, a top surveillance guy in the government agency, CONTROL. He really wants to get promoted and become an agent. He does well on the test; however the chief won't promote him because he's too good at what he does. A criminal organization involved with nukes has hacked into their system and got the identities of all the agents. So, now they need a new agent to track down the nukes and Smart is the guy. He teams up with Agent 99, Hathaway, who just had plastic surgery, so that is why she can do field work.Middle of the film is Smart and 99 in Russia tracking down the bad guys. Hi-jinks ensue; however, I didn't think it was very funny or creative. The Rock is also in this and plays an important part toward the end.Also the spy gadgets really sucked compared to Bond movies. This movie just added nothing new; hence; wasn't that entertaining. Someone jumping out a plane without a parachute and being rescued twice in mid air was just too silly for me. The only scene I can think of I liked was the duel dancing scene at the party. Smart and the fat chick really got down.FINAL VERDICT: I would skip this movie. Naked gun type movies are much better than this one.",Get Smart

I loved his lines and the way he went about business. Anne Hathaway is really beautiful. The veteran actors like James Caan, Terrence Stamp, and Bill Murray all did great and had great screen presence.Overall, this is a hilarious film that should please the mainstream crowd.

41,lesleyharris30,"A Fun Comedy, but had more Potential,",7,28 February 2015,"Get Smart is a very enjoyable movie with a well written storyline and a great comedic cast. It is certainly a lot fun with some great slapstick and cringe comedy, but it had much more potential than what it delivered. This movie easily could have triggered a new spy comedy franchise, similar to the Naked Gun or Austin Powers, but it simply wasn't as funny or memorable as it could have been. However, I do think that a sequel should still be made, I think they can see the few mistakes they made in this one which should be easy to improve on, and we'll get to see Steve Carell really shine in a Frank Drebin-type role. The cast is certainly the highlight, Steve Carell dominates it in the main role, his character is one we knew he could play, a bit more stupid than Michael Scott, but smarter than Brick Tamland, and seeing him in a big budget movie like this certainly brought a smile to my face, he is joined by an excellent supporting cast that includes Anne Hathaway, Alan Arkin and Dwayne Johnson, as well as many terrific cameos. It could have been better, but Get Smart is still a very fun movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy or adventure film.

42,inkblot11,"Get yourself a pack of Red Bull and chug it before going to see this yawn generator, but kudos to the fabulous, hard-working cast",5,23 June 2008,"Maxwell Smart (Steve Carell) has been a top-notch analyst at CONTROL, a CIA-type government entity devoted to espionage. However, Smart wants to be a field agent in the worst way, for he believes he can thwart the evil foes of the United States with his smarts and skills. Finally, he gets his chance and is sent to Russia with agent 99 (Anne Hathaway), to stop a arms-dealing, bomb-planting enemy working for CHAOS (Terence Stamp). 99 resents having a newby for a partner, as she herself is an experienced spy and only appears to be young and beautiful because of her recent, identity-changing plastic surgery. The two spies parachute into Russian territory, although Smart ends up minus his equipment and 99 must rescue him and also fight a giant-size CHAOS agent who suddenly appears in the air next to them. Nevertheless, the chief of CONTROL (Alan Arkin) has confidence in his two agents, along with a third spy (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson). Can they stop CHAOS? What sorrow it is to report that this film is, well, a clunker. Having loved the original show in the sixties, it is a big disappointment, to say the least. The problem is the material, for the script is dull, clichéd, and mostly pointless. The fabulous cast itself, especially Carell and Stamp, bust their guts trying to infuse life into the film and they ultimately fail. What a tragic waste of talent. The credits list Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, the original show's writers, as ""consultants""! Too bad the studio executives didn't call on them to do a massive re-write! The only scene this viewer really laughed over was a ""war-room"" depiction of Arkin going after a Dick Cheney-like vice president. Now, that was funny. Yes, the costumes, scenery, and production values are wonderful. But, these elements are minor players in this film's success. If you loved the Don Adams spy-sitcom, be prepared for a big let-down.

But the film stars the perfect actor for the Maxwell Smart (Agent 86) role--Steve Carrell. And the writers were smart to diverge from the total goofiness that was Don Adams's main character trait. Instead, Max in the film is clueless but lovable and slightly more intelligent.Anne Hathaway is great as agent 99, a perfect blend of beauty, physicality and comic timing. The energy between agents 86 and 99 feels believable.This is a comedy with real laughs. A nice blend of physical humor, one liners, and clever punchlines keeps it fun.Some nice cameos, good production values and special effects make the film a joy to watch, with strong stunt work and credible props that make the film more than a lampoon. It's a spy story with a strong comic sense. I was pleasantly surprised.

This new updated version of the television series, ""Get Smart"" is smart and snappy incorporating a new groundbreaking slant to comedy movies, particularly in are generally regarded serious genre besides ""Get Smart."" Perhaps, ""The Wild, Wild West"" television series and movie had elements of comedy in them. Yet ""Get Smart"" contemporary has Steve Carell bringing his own brand of comedy to the screen, a much more intelligent, subtle and yet serious blend of comedy, action, and drama. Comedies are continuing to evolve into a much richer genre, fusing more and more of the harsh reality of life on the movie screen along with humor and fun. The movie is still rough around the edges, not every stunt or gag worked smoothly, but overall this difficult and much appreciated new level of comedy is deserving of setting a new bar for future action comedies.

45,The-Sarkologist,"No Don Adam's, But Comes Close",7,25 August 2021,"To be honest with you, Steve Carrel is no Don Adams, but he certainly does come pretty close. In fact I almost felt that after watching him in The Office for so long a part of me feels that he is probably the one actor that could pull off Maxwell Smart, though as I suggested, he is certainly not able to truly replace him. The thing is that I grew up on a steady diet of Get Smart, so I guess that is one of the reasons it took me so long to get around to watching this film, namely because there is no way that it could have excelled the original (though a part of me suspects that I have watched it before, I just can't quite remember doing so).The story of Get Smart is that he is an agent for an organisation known as Control, and their nemesis is an organisation known as Khaos. Smart goes by the moniker of Agent 86, and his companion is Agent 99 (and her true name was never revealed in the series). The movie is slightly different in that Max starts off as an analysit, and a pretty thorough one at that, however when all of the field agents are compromised, he is promoted to a field agent and has to go out and stop Khaos from letting loose their nuclear bombs.This film was funny in a way, though much of the humour pretty much revolves around Smart's dumb luck. It's not that he is a bad agent, and it's not that he is stupid either, but rather his success comes about pretty much due to dumb luck, and also the fact that 99 pretty much does most of the hard work, and ironically never complains when Smart actually recieves the accolades.This is no different when it comes to this film, though I have to admit that the chalk and cheese moments between Smart and 99 at the beginning for the film didn't go down all that well, namely because that never seemed to be the nature of the relationship. The other thing that was a little annoying is with Carrell basically pulling all of the lines that made Don Adams perfect for the role. A part of me just felt that it simply didn't work in the same way in the film, but that probably has more to do with me having grown up with the show, and being so used to Don Adams as the title character.Still, despite that, this film was quite fun, and does do credit to the original series, and while I suggested that Carrell could never replace Don Adams, he still does an outstanding job.",Get Smart

And Control, the US secret service no one knows about, is in peril from Chaos, the Russian-bankrolled radioactivity programme masterminded by Siegfried (Terence Stamp), who plan to kill the President (James Caan).'Get Smart' was originally a 1960s spoof spy series and nothing much has changed in its transfer to the big screen, although the jokes are a bit more juvenile (now and again it is funny, for example the scene with the rat and the ending in the Disney Hall).

47,Dr_Coulardeau,"Get smarter if you can, wiser if you may",8,20 September 2008,"That film does not try to make you smart or to be smart itself. In fact it wants you to feel it, it wants you to smart with a big pain you know where because of too much laughing. So it is not witty, nor intellectually humorous. It is just plain silly and dumb so that you may laugh at the antics. Mel Brooks is behind that kind of humor and it is hilarious. Do not think you may get out of it smarter or even wiser. If you recognize the models, the remake of James Bond and even the remake of a 1970s TV parody of James Bond, you might be lighter in the head. You may also recognize some other allusions. But that is all. The only dense aspect in this film is the obsession with the new cold war that would be coming up from Russia. That is a typical American obsession. They make you laugh at it, though it may be serious, but everyone who is sane enough to get up in the morning and go to bed at night will shrug at least one shoulder and just say, the Russians are back, so what! Once again the USA are holding the can of paint and providing the brush and they pretend it is the Russians who are pushing everyone around. But well, as long as they make us laugh at it, why not. Maybe one day the USA will become capable of dropping their superiority complex and they paranoia and see that there are quite many people in the world and that they are all different and they all want to keep their differences. Then maybe we will be able to build a world of peace and concentrate on the delinquents who have to be chased, hunted and brought down.

48,Floated2,Great mix of action and comedy,8,20 August 2009,"I just finished watching this on my laptop. I think it was brilliant to cast Steve Carrell as the beloved Max Smart. His performance, while hardly an imitation, captures beautifully the essence of a character that is a classic for most of us. The movie is very great and has some great action scenes filled with a unique adventure ride. There are some funny parts but its not all that funny (well, i didn't laugh as much). Anne Hathaway apparently is maturing as an actress, and acted 99 in a style much her own. The special effects did their job. They were nice throughout the movie. Especially towards the end with the truck and airplane blowing into flames. Not overwhelming the movie, but filling their space. I loved the scene when Max, Agent 99 and the chief discover that Agent 23 is a ""bad guy"" then he ends up turning against each other and is goes spiraled upwards. The scene when they're fighting in the van is sweet. All together its a real nice and entertaining movie, cant wait for ""Get Smart 2""",Get Smart

She's the perfect support to Carrell's performance and delivers the equilibrium of comedy and action. I enjoyed every single minute of her beauty and most of all when she wore those sexy dresses and mini skirts. She's just too beautiful to be true.The rest of the cast is pretty good and delivers some chuckles.The f/x are impressive and give a good name to Hollywood.

50,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Big stars and some big laughs are enough to make ""Get Smart"" pay off",7,24 November 2008,"""Get Smart"" is best described as modern re-imagining of the original TV show. By adding modern action sequences and the comedic stylings of Steve Carrell, it's certainly not intended to appease the show's fans as much as do some homage here and there--and justifiably so. It's much more modern-day blockbuster formulaic, depending on gadgets, stuff blowing up, and a wealth of stars to draw in all audiences including Carrell, who has proved himself rather bankable when he's playing an idiot.The story is about a secret government spy organization called CONTROL that fights terrorist threats whose top analyst Max Smart (Carrell) gets promoted to a field agent when CONTROL comes under attack by KAOS, its overseas nemesis organization. Accompanied by the beautiful but quite lethal Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway), Max tries to figure out what KAOS is up to.Easily the best part of the film is the humor. Not always dead on in the script (though it is incredibly witty in spots), Carrell adds his brand of physical humor which is certainly important in an action comedy. In general, the film is surprisingly foul-mouthed (in a PG-13 way of course) for something that seemed to sell itself more to families with older children.The other thing the film does well is credit to the casting. Hathaway, at this point clearly a proved leading actress, certainly attracts a younger (and certainly female) audience, while actors like Alan Arkin and an assortment of cameos from the likes of Bill Murray and such will definitely please the older crowd.As an action/spy movie, the gadget lore is certainly not a priority with special effects not exactly at their finest. The look of the film is not a sleek and modern as it could be. The emphasis budget-wise was clearly the comedy and the stars and it pays off for what is a generally enjoyable comedy that is unimpressive but entertaining.",Get Smart

52,Turfseer,Unfunny reinvention of classic TV Series,2,16 May 2009,"Go to Youtube and type in ""Get Smart""—then watch some of the old episodes from the TV Series. Even today you will find the show consistently amusing and sometimes downright funny. Not so with the new updated ""Get Smart"". The idea that there's a museum in Washington paying homage to the now defunct 'Control' spy organization from the 60s and in the basement a modern day Control continues to operate (sort of a counterpart to the CIA) is a good one! But what is the connection of 'Agent 86', the modern day Maxwell Smart to the Control spy of the 60s? Wouldn't it have been better if there had been a picture of Don Adams as Agent 86 when the camera pans through the museum and when we meet Steve Carell's Maxwell Smart, we find out that perhaps he's the famous agent's nephew? That way there would have been a direct connection between the past and the present.The new Maxwell Smart needed to have some kind of deficit to overcome to be funny—similar to Monk's obsessive-compulsive disorder in the hit television series. But here he's a non-descript analyst who can't get a promotion because he's too GOOD at his job. That's not the stuff of laugh out loud comedy. Carell doesn't have much to work with in the script to convey the humor of the bureaucratic egghead he's supposed to be playing; jokes like when The Chief mentions that he was impressed with Max's ""Essay on Existentialism"" while Max is trying to get his job promotion, fall flat.The original Maxwell Smart was funny because he constantly lacked self-awareness; he was a clueless klutz who at the same time was able to overcome the bad guys. The new Maxwell is something much more ordinary. His back story is quite conventional: a former 'numbers cruncher' who used to be overweight and now has worked himself into shape.The new Maxwell Smart competes with Anne Hathaway's Agent 99 attempting to prove he's as competent as her as a field agent despite his lack of experience. He insults her on the plane stating that she's getting old and boasts that he scored higher than her on the Field Agent's test. The original 99 played by the wonderful Barbara Feldon would never have gotten into such inappropriate banter with Max. She supported Max by tolerating his eccentricities and also had a big crush on him to boot. Carell and Hathaway fit the mold of the male and female spy, constantly at odds with one another until they finally realize the error of their ways and fall in love. It's all good for a conventional action thriller but not for comedy! And that perhaps is the main problem with the new Get Smart. It pays homage to the original series by inserting all kinds of references which really have nothing to do with the story itself. And since the references are out of place, they aren't funny (consider the ""Cone of Silence""—in the original it's highly amusing as the characters can hardly communicate with one another; here it's merely dumb, with the cone being transformed into a force field that doesn't work!) The new Get Smart wants to be both a comedy and an action thriller. When you mix serious scenes involving the prevention of a nuclear explosion with slapstick, that's a combination that doesn't work.Unlike the original Maxwell Smart, the new Smart relies on low grade farce to get by. Carell shoots himself in the face with his miniature crossbow numerous times or he finds gum on the sole of his shoe and when he tries to scrape it off with a match, the passengers on a plane mistake him for a shoe bomber. Unlike the original series which often was edgy and satirical, the new Get Smart never takes chances or seeks to offend. Smart, in politically correct fashion, dances with an obese Russian woman at a party to prove how tolerant he is; and the woman gives the finger to a gaggle of pretty Russian women on the sidelines who have been staring at her dancing with Max! In the end, the new Get Smart jettisons its comic tone completely. A turn-coat Agent 23 played by Duane Johnson battles Carell in an extended car chase scene while Alan Arkin flies overhead in a small aircraft. At the end, the writers of the new Get Smart run out of ideas. Instead of paying homage, what was needed was a complete re-imagining of the original TV Series. And that could have been accomplished with satire and not the tired combination of low-level slapstick humor coupled with the clichés of the action thriller genre.",Get Smart

Karman Ghia, and of course, the iconic 'shoe-phone', and all of Smart's numerous 'catch phrases' get aired (""would you believe..."", ""missed me by that much"", ""sorry about that Chief"", etc.). Steve Carell is OK as agent Maxwell Smart but he doesn't have the same natural dead-pan delivery that Don Adams had (or the distinctive voice) that made the original so funny. Anne Hathaway, like Barbara Feldon before her, makes a gorgeous agent 99 and Alan Arkin is great as CONTROL's head honcho ""The Chief"" (and gets a lot more screen time than his predecessor Edward Platt ever did). The story is typical of the current crop of 'high tech' thrillers and the script is OK, but the humour is forced a times and some of the stunt set-pieces go on too long.

Steve Carell stars as Agent 86 for CONTROL Espionage Operations or better known to us as Maxwell Smart. Anne Hathaway is going to smarty like she's Agent 99, because she is playing Max's fellow Control agent colleague, Agent 99. 86 and 99 do a 69 and the film is voted as the best film of the year by the Adult Film Industry; OK, so not quite; yes I was being a ""Smart Ass"". OK back on track: 86 and 99's mission is to control a chaotic organization named CHAOS who has revealed the identities of many CONTROL agents and are liquidating them down one-by-one. CHAOS is headed by the evil Siegfreid played by veteran actor Terence Stamp. Siegfried's right hand man is Roy; oops wrong ring leader! I meant to say Shtarker played by Ken Davitian of ""Borat"" fame. 86 and 99 might be unnumbered by the CHAOS Crew, but they still find wickedly smart ways to control their mission barring some Maxwell Not-So-Smart klutzy investigative methods. Nevertheless, Smart did not get smart for nothing and is able to be smartly heroic in his own zany Maxwell way. The Control Chief is played by Oscar-winner Alan Arkin who also must control an overzealous now-desk Agent 23 who misses ""playing the field agent"" gig he had before. Do not mess with The Number 23 because he can rock you to pieces probably because he is portrayed by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. ""Get Smart"" lacks cerebral comedy and instead goes for the slapstick comedy route which works in some scenes but unravels in others to no effective comedic lineage. Director Peter Segal's orchestration could have been smarter with the plot, but at the same time did tune us in to some charismatic characters. The ensemble acting of ""Get Smart"" including Carell, Hathaway, Arkin, and Johnson were able to control their thespian abilities enough to anonymously deliver fine performances but I think it was the 99 that was the most fine, in more ways than one. A for Hathaway! Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember's semi-smart screenplay of ""Get Smart"" was at best in the 86 and 99 sarcastic verbal exchanges but in mediocre control for the other scenes.

57,jimbo-53-186511,"Suffers from a slightly muddled plot and not all of it is funny, but it is fairly enjoyable mainly thanks to Carrell and Hathaway",6,9 February 2015,"I'm going to preface this review by stating that I haven't seen the original TV series upon which this film was based on. Therefore I'm unable to draw comparisons and will just stick to reviewing this film.One thing I did think was really good about this film was some of the casting choices; Carrell is particularly good here and is very convincing in his respective role as the bumbling & inept rookie agent. He brings a sort of naïve charm to many of his performances and I can't think of a role I've seen him in where I didn't enjoy his performance. Likewise, I think that Hathaway is a perfect compliment to Carrell and their chemistry in this was great - Hathaway pulls off the sexy, sassy & ultra confident field agent with ease. Alan Arkin is a great actor and is always watchable. Likewise, I thought Terrence Stamp was a very effective villain and was quite menacing. Even Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson (who is not the best of actors) managed to also be quite good here.I wasn't convinced by all of the characters however; I found Koechner & Crews characters to be more annoying than funny. The same could be said of the two nerds who were also annoying rather than funny (although not as much as Koechner & Crews). Bill Murray also has a cameo in this which seemed a bit pointless to me.The one problem with this film was its rather muddled plot- I found it to be very unfocused and it seemed to jump around from place to place and the narrative seemed to jump back and forward which made the story hard to follow at times. Although this was a problem for me, thankfully it wasn't a huge problem as I still found that I enjoyed the film as a whole even if the plot was a little scattershot at times. The main reasons that this film works is due to the excellent chemistry between Hathaway and Carrell and their great interplay makes it possible to ignore some of the issues with the plotting.Get Smart is funny, but it's not a film that's consistently funny but rather a film that is occasionally funny - although I must admit that some of the jokes were really funny so perhaps it's just a case of quality over quantity. Whilst I haven't seen the original TV Series the closest thing that this film reminds me of is Johnny English - therefore if you enjoyed Johnny English then you should enjoy this too.

There are a few moments where the comedy just doesn't work that well, either because it's too obvious or just because we've seen it done so many times before. But luckily those times aren't the vast majority. The majority of the comedy is pretty funny and I credit that to Steve Carrel. Anne Hathaway is good in her role here and she's a great talented actress but being funny in a movie just isn't her forte. But she is a good partner for Carrel and is charming, fitting for the role. Dwayne the rock Johnson is here too, he plays the perfect fellow agent who everybody adores. He was the PERFECT choice to play this self absorbed, arrogant lady killer. The script is cute and entertaining, has its funny moments and it's not so funny moments, typical of just about any comedy. The comical action is fun to watch and enjoy. The movie overall is a pretty good movie adaptation of the classic 1960s television show. It's not the greatest in the world but it's not poorly done either. I suggest it for someone looking for an average comedy and a fairly good time. Even though yes there are better comedic choices out there.",Get Smart
60,rooprect,"Entertaining stuff, a few good LOLs, hilarious cameos, great cast.",7,18 July 2019,"Right off the bat, if you're the kind of person who hates all remakes then of course you'll hate this movie. But if that's you, then why even bother reading reviews?Good, you're still here, so we'll assume that you're willing to give this flick a fair shake. ""Get Smart"" (2008) is a reboot of the iconic tv series, and by ""reboot"" I mean that it doesn't necessarily follow the original storyline except that the characters share the same names. In this version, Maxwell Smart is a lowly analyst who gets his big shot at being an agent. Other than being a general nerd, his schtick is that, being an obsessive intelligence analyst, he knows the enemy inside out. So even though he may not be a dashing superhero, his intelligence is his strength. When he's not being a total clueless dolt, that is. I thought this was a great new angle.His counterbalance is Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway), an experienced field operative who has to put up with Max's quirky arrogance. She may possibly have some anger issues. Again, a really fun character to watch.The plot? Not important. Like the original tv show, the plot is rather superficial with the real entertainment being carried by the gags. There were some nice nods to the original show, such as the ridiculous ""cone of silence"", the absurd gadgets crammed into common household objects, and of course some of the original trademark catchphrases (""Missed it by that much""). A few of the zingers were really funny and got some full belly laugh out of me. But they were sparsely placed, and that's my only criticism. Perhaps in an attempt to keep the plot moving, there were not enough bizarre wisecracks as I would have liked. One of my favorites was when Agent 99 somberly tells Max that if he gets caught, there's a pill in his belt buckle that causes death in 9 seconds. To which Max replies: ""But how will I get them to take it?"" This is the kind of humor that made the original so fun and makes this version a worthy homage.The cameos are awesome with fleeting appearances by Kevin Nealon (from SNL), Patrick Warburton (Elaine's weird boyfriend ""Putty"" on Seinfeld), James Caan as ""the president"" (who can't pronounce ""nuclear"" - I wonder who that is), and none other than Bill Murray as Agent 13.Dwayne Johnson practically steals the show as Agent 23, a caricature of every action hero he's ever played.A final note worth noting: the technical consultant mentioned in the credits is THE Mel Brooks. It didn't surprise me because at times this has a somewhat Brooksian flair, especially in the hilarious ballroom dance number, oddly reminiscent of ""the czardas"" dance in Dracula: Dead & Loving It. Bottom line, if you are ready for a good time you'll have a good time.",Get Smart
61,JoeKarlosi,Get Smart (2008) **,5,4 July 2008,"I used to love the elaborate credits sequence of the old GET SMART television show, but I never really stuck around as a child to watch much of the show itself. Most of the comedy at that age went over my head, I suppose... and that unfamiliarity is probably why I didn't have any personal nostalgic bias in my way to prevent me from seeing this new film. Besides, I think that Steve Carell in the role of Maxwell Smart is about as wise a choice as there can be today, if you're going to bother with a redux at all. Pretty Anne Hathaway is okay as his partner Agent 99 (though I think I'd favor Barbara Feldon if I was ever given such an opportunity to choose). What this movie came down to for me was a case of good casting (I'll also add Alan Arkin to the list as ""Chief"") but weak script writing. I just expected more laughs, more bizarre situations along the lines of the funny scene of what happens to Max in the men's room while aboard the plane. This comedy's just not funny enough. But at least I can say it was enough to stir my curiosity to getting hold of Season One of the old TV show and seeing what I think of it. ** out of ****",Get Smart
62,EUyeshima,Missed It by THAT Much.But Carell and Hathaway Deliver Amid the Pyrotechnics,6,23 June 2008,"Forty years since its original airings, the classic 1965-69 TV series created by Mel Brooks and Buck Henry was a family room fixture during my childhood. So was ""Bewitched"", and the 2005 update was an unmitigated disaster that made me understandably wary of another big-screen version of a baby-boomer staple, especially since director Peter Segal is mainly known for Adam Sandler comedies. The 2008 update is not nearly as bad as some critics would lead you to think, but it's also a bit of a hit-and-miss mess teetering precariously between slapstick - often very funny - and full-blown action. Fortunately, Steve Carell has been cast as Agent 86 Maxwell Smart, and he knows how to mimic Don Adams' deadpan befuddlement while remaining true to his comic screen persona. He is the one consistent note amid a convoluted plot that tries to make the Cold War-era, spy-versus-spy machinations relevant to a contemporary audience by melding together the clichés of several summer blockbusters.TV veterans Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember offer little in the way of affectionate tribute to the original series other than some pointed references, and they even have the audacity to pilfer the finale of 1978's ""Foul Play"" (which in itself was lifted from Hitchcock's ""The Man Who Knew Too Much""). As a lot of us know, Smart in the TV series was a secret agent for CONTROL, a secret government organization that's even more discreet than the CIA. When the Cold War ended, CONTROL was disbanded, or so the public was told. However, it continues to operate underground (literally) in a state-of-the-art facility in Washington D.C. In the movie, Smart is not yet an agent but a crackerjack analyst who can figure out heavily coded conversations picked up by CONTROL surveillance. Naturally he wants to be an agent, but the Chief values him too much as his top analyst. Things change, however, when the evil KAOS organization (also surviving since the end of the Cold War) systematically identifies and kills CONTROL's field agents. The Chief has no recourse but to make Smart Agent 86 and partner him with the more experienced and decidedly female Agent 99.The culprit turns out to be Siegfried, another carryover from the series, who has been obtaining nuclear materials for obvious no-good. This means the agents need to go to Moscow and infiltrate a bakery where they are apparently building the weapons. The action eventually comes back stateside with plenty of explosions, chases and double-crossing. Other than the fact that Mike Myers has already beaten the filmmakers to the punch with his espionage-driven comedy blockbusters, my one persistent issue with the movie is how contrived the storyline seems to resuscitate Cold War tensions a quarter-century after glasnost. As Smart, Carell plays up the lack of awareness he does so well in ""The Office"" but not in a way that makes him either unintentionally foolish or excessively sardonic. Although too young to be credible as a seasoned agent (despite the contrived reason offered), Anne Hathaway submerges her girl-next-door persona to play 99 with surprising dexterity or at least just enough to get away with the leather cat-suits and karate kicks. They make a solid comic pair, though the romantic aspect of their characters' relationship seems undernourished.The rest of the cast play their parts with predictable vigor. Dwayne Johnson shows palpable comic ability as the too-perfect Agent 23, while Terence Stamp plays Siegfried in his typically perturbed deadpan fashion (close your eyes and you can almost hear Bernadette in ""The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert""). Reunited with Carell from ""Little Miss Sunshine"" but missing his innately manic persona, Alan Arkin plays the thankless role of the Chief. Ken Davitian, Borat's favorite nude wrestling partner, has a few amusing moments as Siegfried's henchman, and in what looks like the start of a comedy team, Masi Oka (""Heroes"") and Nate Torrence play a couple of CONTROL's technical geeks. There are a couple of funny cameos from James Caan as a Dubya-style President and Bill Murray as hapless, self-pitying Agent 13 (the role Dave Ketchum played on the series). Even with its arid stretches, there are enough laughs to make the film worthwhile.",Get Smart
63,fertilecelluloid,Another popcorn movie for the easily pleased imbecile masses,2,1 July 2008,"Another perfect example of why I despise most Hollywood movies, especially the Summer ""popcorn movie"". To me, ""popcorn movie"" describes a pile of celluloid dung that is choking on its own clichés and promises not to come in your mouth -- but does so, anyway, because it thinks it can get away with it. I am a fan of the original ""Get Smart"", a very funny TV show that was brilliantly written and scaled rather small. It was not big on stunts and explosions; on the contrary, its focus was the inept, oblivious Maxwell Smart (played by Don Adams). Over two decades ago, Hollywood did make a ""Get Smart"" movie -- the ironically titled ""The Nude Bomb"", which, not surprisingly, bombed. Now, the TV series has been revived again and turned into a noisy, stupid, stunt-filled extravaganza with a couple of decent laughs. Steve Carrell, who stars as the Ricky Gervais character in the awful American ""The Office"", takes on the Max role. From the get-go, he's written all wrong as a self-aware, occasional idiot; his antics are not funny because he's too conscious of what he's doing. The action sequences are a big yawn. Even Carrell's delivery of a line like ""missed it by that much"" (after he crashes into a wall) is off. Ann Hathaway, who'd look good naked, plays Agent 99 with far too much confidence and arrogance. Who wants to watch such a bee-yatch behaving badly? The ""popcorn movie"" joins the ""rollercoaster ride"" as a damn irritating excuse for cinematic expulsion. Of course, the film has been a huge hit with the imbecile masses.",Get Smart

Please do not get me wrong this is not a great movie, but compared to some other movies made from TV shows of the past, GET SMART is far above them.This time around Tom Astle & Matt Ember wrote the screenplay with Peter Segal directing.There are many more special effects CGI employed here & even tho the stunts are impossible & only the bad guys get killed.They are all well done.Now to the cast Steve Carell is Max..He is no Don Adams but does come close.The Beautiful & very talented Anne Hathaway is Agent 99 & that is enough for meAlan Arkin is the exasperated Chief as only he can do.Dwayne Johnson (aka the ROCK) is Agent 23 ,There is a double agent amongst this group, BIG Surprise when we find out who.Terrance Stamp is the Arch-villain.Also look for James Caan, Bill Murray & 2 from SNL in cameo roles.This is pure silly fun I enjoyed itRatings *** (out of 4) 82 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)",Get Smart
65,Jonny_Numb,Wise up--it's pretty good!,7,8 July 2008,"When blowing-up a television series to a feature film, a single question rears its sensible, logical head: Why bother? The ratio of feature films that outdo their small-screen predecessors is indeed a dismal bunch to ponder, usually because the need to expend millions of dollars on spectacle ultimately overshadows what made said show so beloved and treasured in the first place. Indeed, many of these tele-remakes take only the title and character names, and bank less on baby-boomer familiarity than the prospect of their kids paying money to see Owen Wilson play the lead. ""Get Smart""based on the classic Mel Brooks series (which, unfortunately, I haven't seen in many years)is a film that, on initial glance, threatens to open the bile ducts for yet another pointless TV overhaul, but has several elements in its favor that, surprisingly, transform it from a guilty pleasure to a genuinely fun summer flick.First and foremost is the cast: Steve Carell inhabits the bumbling Maxwell Smart with the same blend of simultaneous brilliance and incompetence that made Leslie Nielsen's Frank Drebin (in the ""Naked Gun"" films) such a riot, while never veering into stupidity for stupidity's sake. Similarly, Anne Hathaway's slinky Agent 99 provides a game and sexy foil to Smart's foibles, and registers convincingly as a potential love interest for our oft-hapless hero. Alan Arkin has ribald fun as The Chief of CONTROL, nailing dry, deadpan line deliveries with occasional explosions into outrageous physical comedy (including a great scene with the Department of Homeland Security). And Dwayne Johnson (aka ""The Rock"") continues his comedic evolutionbalanced against requisite hard-bitten toughnessas the short-tempered Agent 23. All of the actors (including inspired supporting players like David Koechner, Masi Oka, Nate Torrence, and even Bill Murray in a cameo) do a fine job of treading the line between seriousness and camp, resulting in a mostly even-toned film.Kudos must go to writers Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember, who infuse the film with a straightness and reverence to its source that doesn't cheapen things with pop-culture gags and scatological humor (save for one scene where Max and 99 walk through a sewer); their script also avoids the obnoxious observational (non-)humor of the Judd Apatow canon, playing the story on a semi-serious level when need be. Veteran comedy director Peter Segal (once associated with the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker parody team) keeps ""Get Smart"" from venturing too far into post-modern winkiness, save for a few distinctly current touches (a dimwit president that echoes Dubya; higher-tech gizmos for Smart and Co. to toy with) that actually nicely parallels the retro-MacGuffin of supervillain Siegfried's (Terence Stamp) nefarious plot to obliterate Hollywood with leftover Cold War technology.While the film has its share of misfired gags, Segal keeps things moving at such a rapid clip that he quickly compensates for his own high energy. If ""Get Smart"" has a glaring flaw, it would have to be a stretched running time (edging toward 2 hours) that outstays its welcome a wee bit too much; an obvious anti-climax early on gives way to a third act that can be seen coming from a mile away. And while some of the action scenes completely forego the humor, thus coming off as a slightly awkward contrast to the rest of the film, I have to say the mix still works most of the time""Get Smart"" isn't for the film-snob analysts, but rather those looking for a good time at the cinema without any questions asked.6.5 out of 10",Get Smart

Putting big action stars behind the lead comedian seems to be a common move, yet this movie also see that being predictable is always the case. There's always a double agent, or even a double- crossing double agent. With this movie, having Steve Carrell as the main comedian seems at a redundancy. The actor is more well known for his more stupid roles, as in Anchorman, and didn't quite satisfy as spy, even in a comedy. Dwayne Johnson is only a flash in this whole movie. Anne Hathaway didn't really explore her role and thus her performance seems only a balancer to the supposedly comedic Max Smart.

69,Kamurai25,Got Smart?,7,24 June 2020,"Very funny watch, will likely watch again, and can recommend.Granted its based off an old tv show, they managed to not only reference that, but breathe fresh new life into: they don't try to modernize the old show, they just pick up sometime after the old one and move along.While the premise for this movie is a little ridiculous, that's the point, and it works, in no small part to Steven Correll and Anne Hatheway who carry the movie well alonside a slew of great comedy faces as supporting characters.Terence Stamp does his lovely evil british villain performance and is almost too serious for the role. Alongside a guy that hurts his own team as much as the enemy, it makes for quite a contrast.Because it is a comedy, they manage to parody quite a few action / spy tropes, and they went for like they'd never get a sequence because the production value on this is that of a real action movie, just with training wheels put on at points so the comedians can keep up.If you liked Hatheway in this, I'd recommend ""The Hustle"", I got very similar vibes between this role, that, and Catwoman (Dark Knight Rises).",Get Smart

As I'm sure some other viewers have compared, this current production is reminiscent of the Naked Gun series only Leslie Nielson is funnier than Steven Carell, and there's a lot less sexual innuendo in Get Smart. Moreover this series doesn't have as many gags, but you could make a case that the Naked Gun Series had way too many gags to where they lost their laugh value. This is a pretty good comedy. There are a couple of laugh-out-loud parts imperative for a good slap-stick comedy and some cameos. Anne Hathaway is a bit too serious here, but satisfactory.

71,lewiskendell,A nice little action-comedy.,7,17 March 2010,"I enjoyed every minute of Get Smart. It's an agreeable and fun mixture of the action, spy, and comedy genres. Imagine a combination of Mr. and Mrs. Smith and Pineapple Express, with some Steve Carell-style comedy mixed in. It's not similar in story to either of those movies, but it does manage to blend action and comedy together in a comparable way.The casting is perfect, and really what makes Get Smart so likable. There is a pretty amazing group of actors gathered here, especially considering the fact that these kinds of films do not often attract A-list talent. Everyone seemed like they were having fun and enjoying their roles, and it shows in their acting.Get Smart has a basic spy-type plot that certainly won't be winning any awards for originality. At the same time, I never though the fairly typical story was detracting from the movie. You're probably not watching this for a deep and thought-provoking experience, anyway.  And who would have guessed that Anne Hathaway would be so good in an action role? I'd love to see her do more of this kind of thing in the future, she has a bit of a talent for it.",Get Smart
72,winner55,"""Nude Bomb"" II?",4,13 October 2008,"Some ten years after the close of the original Get Smart! TV show, Don Adams attempted a one-shot revival theatrical film, The Nude Bomb. The title did it justice: the film lacked any of the original characters or the actors who played them except Adams as Maxwell Smart. That pretty much doomed the film, because much of the humor arose from Smart's interactions with these characters.A few years later, the TV show received its proper farewell with a television movie, Get Smart Again! that brought back the surviving actors to play the character they had originated. I admit it wasn't the best TV movie ever made, but it was definitely worth a few chuckles; and it was successful enough to initiate a TV show supposedly about Smart's protégée in the film. That failed also, for much the same reason as the Nude Bomb; fans of Get Smart! want Max and the crew, not just the same type of humor under the same name.The makers of the new Get Smart film almost get it - but not quite. The script flirts with the old schtick, but it only works in one scene where Smart confronts KAOS sidekick Starker in a lab. Otherwise, punches are pulled unnecessarily all over the place. Anne Hathaway does surprisingly well as agent 99, but Steve Carrel waffles between a poor Adams impersonation and trying to redefine the character as his own. He really needed to make this choice before filming began. But a large part of the problem here is the direction, and the director also blows the most important aspects of the comedy elements on the film - pacing and emphasis. Punchlines get swallowed and tossed away as if they didn't exist. No wonder so much time is spent making believable action sequences - as if we wanted big explosions and believable gunplay from a Get Smart! movie.What a disappointment- and ultimately, the film becomes just another Nude Bomb - but why remake a failure? Hollywood seems to be doing that a lot lately - is it all those drugs or have they just all gone crazy?",Get Smart

There were many of them and I found myself laughing out loud and at odds with my original mindset. Totally unexpected. There is one scene with Smart dancing with a woman about 400-pounds that is absolutely hilarious and I do not use that term lightly. It was also a very touching scene as well. As for Steve Carell, he played it correctly and didn't try to imitate Don Adams too much and that was helpful. Really. So all in all this was very enjoyable.

My wife and I love the TV series, and are currently going through the DVD of the ""real"" Get Smart.This 2008 movie is only a bit funny. The action scenes are way too drawn out, seemingly endless chasing and running for no real purpose other than to keep the movie from being over in 45 minutes.In the original, Max would bump his head or do some other painful but harmless injury to himself. In this movie, some of the stunts were quite painful to watch, particularly when he stupidly kept shooting himself with the little arrows. Seeing arrows flying into a foot and parts of his face was gruesome, not at all funny. There were other scenes where the violence was hard to watch because it was so painful to contemplate.Nor was it the least bit funny when we saw a large amount of what was supposed to be his vomit, spilling out of a bag. Sick! The film's Agent 99 was much too cocky and arrogant to be likable--totally unlike Barbara Feldon's portrayal. I think Alan Arkin is a wonderful actor, but I cannot think of anything he did that was remotely funny in this film. Ed Platt made me laugh in virtually every episode of the TV series.I don't care about unrealistic action or holes in the plot--though plentiful. It was a comedy, supposedly. Yet even though it lasted about as long as four episodes of the series, the film didn't have half as many laughs as a single typical episode of the real ""Get Smart.""",Get Smart
76,dunmore_ego,Get Dumb. And Dumber.,3,26 December 2008,"Who wrote this crap? Would you believe...? Well, it wasn't Mel Brooks and Buck Henry. Their Maxwell Smart (personified by Don Adams) was hilarious. As the creators-writers of the 1965 television series, GET SMART, they are listed as ""creative consultants"" as soon as the end credits roll. It's as if the writers of this torpid remake (Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember) were trying to pass the blame as soon as the movie ended and you realized you hadn't laughed once. (That half-cough when Hymie appeared in the last five minutes didn't count.) Do they think we're as dumb as Smart? We know it's their fault this GET SMART retains none of the magic and vitality of Brooks's and Henry's. Director Peter Segal's pedigree does not bode well either, his last three films trumpeting his mediocrity: THE LONGEST YARD, 50 FIRST DATES, ANGER MANAGEMENT.Segal and Astle and Ember forgot that 1965's GET SMART was a cheeky spoof of the spy movie genre. 2008's GET SMART is an espionage action movie. It takes itself so seriously (with insufferable CGI  for Max's iconic corridor of security doors, with the annoying Cone of Silence  and real-world technology and even murders) that someone forgot to tell Steve Carell, whose performance is that of an idiot savant dropped amongst OCEAN'S ELEVEN.Maxwell Smart (Carell) is an analyst at the modern spy agency, CONTROL. His aspiration is to become a field agent, like the legendary Agent 23 (Dwayne Johnson) or Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway). Throw in an unnecessary backstory about Max being overweight and we have our first waste of screen time in the can. At headquarters, two Information Tech dweebs make the usual IT jokes, while two Agents (David Koechner and Terry Crews) make the usual dweeb jokes about the IT guys. More lost screen time.After CONTROL HQ is destroyed by KAOS, the organization intent on spreading... uh, chaos, Max is made an agent and sent on a mission that I didn't pay enough attention to for it to be worth mentioning. The mission is the McGuffin, serving only to give Max something serious to aim for while he misses the mark with unfunny gags, including shooting himself with tiny darts, dancing with a fat lady, being dragged by a train... while we, the Susceptible Audience, are hopefully busting a gut.Suffice to say, Max and 99 eventually blow up a WMD facility (oh, how very Dubya of them!), while fighting a villain who looks like Jaws from THE SPY WHO LOVED ME.Instead of the coy bedroom eyes of Barbara Feldon, Anne Hathaway plays Agent 99 as if she's on a constant period. Dwayne (formerly The Rock) Johnson is given too little screen time for his smarmy assassin character. Alan Arkin plays The Chief almost as flustered as the original's Edward Platt. Instead of the fruitiness of Bernie Kopell's Siegfried, Terence Stamp plays the ""Cherman"" villain as if he's on a constant period. Stamp is almost the same age as Bernie Kopell (who is relegated to a cameo), so the question is, why couldn't the real Siegfried play Siegfried? Max's iconic one-liners just don't work - ""Sorry about that Chief!"" ""Missed it by that much!"" ""Would you believe...?"" - because they are said only once and never given the chance to grow into callbacks.2008's GET SMART would be enjoyable for youngsters who have never seen the original television series (which would look dated and unfunny to them anyway). The only way for it to be enjoyable for those of us who HAVE seen the television series - is to watch the television series.I miss Don Adams's slapshot delivery. I miss Thaddeus's furrowed brow. I miss 99 saving Max's life and not turning it into a fist-up for feminists. It is obvious the filmmakers don't ""get"" GET SMART. They missed it... by THAT much.The DVD features a ""Comedy Optimization Mode"" with ""hilarious alternative jokes."" That's a good thing, since the actual jokes in the film are NOT ""hilarious."" One alternative gag shows two Middle Eastern ""terrorists"" (they must be terrorists, they're Middle Eastern, right?), wearing their white sheet-like garb, commenting to each other, ""I'm not wearing any underwear."" ""Neither am I."" When I rail at movies and songs stealing ideas of mine, I didn't think they'd actually steal one of my gags from fourth grade.According to IMDb, Steve Carell and B.J.

So I can only rank this film according to its quality as a film,and a summer movie at that.I have to say,it hit the mark exactly,adding some solid sight and verbal gags to the fairly mint material that was on the trailer(which had been running for what seems an age).Steve Carell's physical nature,as well as his lack of prepossession in regards to jokes and pratfalls,make him perfect as MAxwell Smart,a bumbling but still bright and effective would-be field agent for CONTROL(which is sort of a parallel outfit for the CIA,NSA,etc.).

The latest in the line of enjoyable but forgettable modern comedic re-dos including Starsky and Hutch and Bewitched, Get Smart, adapted from the classic spy satire by legendary comic Mel Brooks proves a more sturdy film than many of its predecessors, surmounting many common complaints with an incessantly cheerful and lightheartedly comedic touch, determinedly providing an enjoyable watch in the absence of any loftier goals. Director Peter Segal (veteran of countless Adam Sandler comedies) seems determined to meld an exhilarating action movie feel with the irreverent parodying of spy movie conventions, which for the most part proves an agreeable balance, though occasionally leads to an overly wavering tone. But thrill as the film may, it undeniably fizzles when scratching at profundity, as the contrived emotional scenes (including a shoddily developed romantic subplot) prove among the film's weakest moments - despite the tremendous chemistry between Carell and Hathaway, attempts at serious interactions lack the energetic spark which made their humorous interactions so enjoyable. But despite attempts to add nuance to the irreverence of Brooks' source material, Get Smart predictably is at its best when playing to its strengths as a comedy, executing a tirade of familiar comedic situations with assurance and time hewn ease. While certain points toe the line of unnecessarily stupid humour (the oh so overused fat suit comedic device is used yet again to predictably underwhelming effect) for the most part, the film doles out the ideal quantity of self effacing silliness while retaining a focused enough touch to prevent it from descending into total lunacy. The cunning script provides certain moments of brilliantly inventive comedic mastery, from situational humour (Carell's hanging off a plane from a banner advocating suicide prevention is priceless) to subtly sly jabs at sources as varied as topical politics to the spy genre the movie sends up in the midst of the more obvious bodily humour and slapstick which pervades the film. Segal also works in enough cute references to the television series (the original sunbeam tiger car and shoe phone cameo to amusing effect and Trevor Rabin's musical score adds exhilarating heavy guitar riffs to the far too catchy original theme) to sate fans without beating the audience over the head with unnecessary tributes. The film's quality cast are the added leverage to keep Get Smart elevated above par, having the good sense to play the material relatively straight instead of consistently obnoxiously winking at the audience, making the silliness all the more appealing. As the title character Maxwell Smart, Steve Carell is on top form, effortlessly blending irreverent physical comedy with a stone faced deadpan and endearing charm, helping even the weakest of gags take flight with ease. The lovely Anne Hathaway provides a likable vulnerable charisma to her no nonsense action woman while simultaneously executing her main dual tasks of quality action scenes and looking good all the while with decent aplomb. Dwayne Johnson, far from being a punch line in himself, surprisingly proves sturdy comedic support, his tremendous charisma taking the sag out of a potentially flimsy star agent role. Fellow masters of deadpan Alan Arkin and Terrence Stamp add understated class to their respective roles as heads of both good agency CONTROL and the devious KAOS, while spitting out the majority of the film's best lines with gleeful nonchalance. The film's myriad of amusing cameos (including a hilarious James Caan as a U.S. President not at all unlike Bush and Bill Murray as an estranged agent stationed in a fake tree) also provide comedic punch at crucial moments, but the bulk of the film's main charm resides in the amusing banter between Carell and Hathaway. While it will win few plaudits for originality, Get Smart's confident execution of time worn physical and situational humour and clever script proves a winner. With an impressively balanced interchanging between irreverent comedy and thrilling action sequences and the charming cast exuding tremendous charisma, the film proves an unabashedly enjoyable (if admittably shallow) romp, and just the thing for those who prefer their comedy silly with a dash of nostalgia. -7/10",Get Smart
79,Pumpkin_Man,An Extremely Awesome Film!!!,10,1 July 2009,"This movie is incredibly funny, and a great tribute to the classic series, in which it is based on. Steve Carell is awesome and hilarious as Maxwell Smart, who works as an analyst for the top secret American intelligence agency, CONTROL. Max wishes to be a field agent. When Max passes his test, the Chief of CONTROL feels that Max's analytical skills are too valuable. When CONTROL is attacked, the chief decides to make Max an agent. His partner is Agent 99, played by the incredibly beautiful Anne Hathaway. Agent 99 does not want to work with Max because she sees him as irritating. The more they work together, the more they like each other. They must stop a man named Siegfried, who plants a bomb at a concert. To make matters worse, Max is accused of being a double agent. He tries to break out, and try to stop the bomb from going off, and save Agent 99 from the 'real' double agent. This movie is filled to the brim with action, and comedy! I highly recommend GET SMART!!!",Get Smart

Get Smart works in many ways. It works as a comedy and an action film. Director Peter Segal's films are very funny and this is a good one. I have never seen the show Get Smart. I had never heard of it until one of my teachers talked about it. Well, i've seen the film... it should be good enough. Maxwell Smart is like Inspector Gadget in a way. He's clumsy, uses things like the shoe phone(Inspector Gadget doesn't use that but he uses gadgets. You should've known that. Maxwell Smart uses gadgets, but is more clumsy. Steve Carell is very good as Maxwell Smart. Anne Hathaway is pretty good as Agent 49. Get Smart is very funny, very entertaining and has a good cast. Including The Rock, Alan Arkin, Terrence Stomp, and James Caan as the president. Get Smart has a sequel coming out in 2011. I wish it would come out sooner than that. Steve Carell is funny in everything besides Evan almighty, which was mostly a kids comedy. It was an epic but no good. I quite liked Dan in real life, and this film is very good.

When all the agents are killed, Max us promoted to the role of Spy and sets out to bring CHAOS down.Steve Carell is really funny and is surprisingly convincing as the tough guy, he gels beautifully well with the script that makes you laugh at every turn; The Rock was a brilliant addition to the film; he played the role of the 'prfect' spy brilliantly.I loved the toilet scene, the air plane escape scene and I could go on and on, this film takes the repetitive spy formula and successfully sells it quite well.",Get Smart
83,areatw,Lame jokes fill this boring comedy,4,11 February 2018,"Let me start off by saying that I haven't seen the TV series that this movie is adapted from, and so can't make any comparisons or comment on its transition to the big screen. Having viewed 'Get Smart' with next to no knowledge of what the the show was even about, I was hugely disappointed to find a generic and boring comedy movie filled with a bunch of lame and unoriginal jokes.There was only one scene that actually made me laugh, and that was the one where Carrell's character is attempting to navigate the room full of laser traps. Other than than, the humour just didn't appeal to me and there's nothing that separates the jokes in this film from the majority of other modern day comedies. 'Get Smart' is a poor comedy movie and I'm completely put off from checking out the TV show if it's anything like this.",Get Smart
84,TheUnknown837-1,Gut-bustingly funny; it's one of the best comedies of the past ten years,9,16 November 2010,"I can still remember to this day sitting in a theater with my family, waiting for the movie to start. I cannot remember the movie we saw that day and I only remember the occasion was because of the ecstatic vibe that circulated throughout the theaters with the first ""Get Smart"" trailer appeared. At the time I was completely unfamiliar with the original 1960s TV show and I am still a neophyte to this day...but nothing could have held back my ambition to see this big-screen remake.The original show was produced by Mel Brooks and Buck Henry as a parody in response to the success of the James Bond pictures. It was completely zany and packed with a lot of hypnotic charm especially personified by the character of Maxwell Smart played by the late Don Adams. This new, big-screen version in which Max is played by Steve Carrell is very much of a movie of the same sort, but updated to a more contemporary, times-friendly state. It's also gut-bustingly funny.Like with the TV show, ""Get Smart"" has a plot as thin a string of hair from a horse's tail. And that's all it needs. Max (Carrell) is promoted to the rank of agent for the secret government agency called CONTROL in order to battle their arch-nemesis: the terrorist group known as KAOS. Teamed up with a professional, experienced agent named 99 (Anne Hathaway) he embarks on his mission...and a series of pratfalls, parodies, and hilarious situations.The movie is slightly more serious in tone than the show, but it almost has to be since that seems to be the trend in modern-day humor pictures. A few people are killed and it's not treated in a silly manner. It's necessary, I think, to generate menace on the part of the KAOS agents. It also seems trendy these days for the heroes to be fools and the bad guys to be competent. Wouldn't it be something if dictators made threats to make pudding of human bones and that our top general would wave it off since bones make a crunchy pudding and nobody likes that. My point with this is that the movie will appease those who grew up watching the original and fledglings like myself.There are truly great laughs to be found all throughout the movie. Another fond cinema memory of mine is finally seeing the movie in the summer of 2008. As a measure of how tickling the movie was to my mind, I walked out of the theater gasping for air for there were gags were I continued to laugh long after the joke in question had subsided and passed on to another one. But the movie also scores high because it is not sheer slapstick; there's a lot of potent charm and tenderness to be found as well. The relationship between Max and 99 seems generic in ostensible terms but is developed and written to the point where you can believe in their chemistry. You follow them along; you like them. That's something I really miss in a lot of modern-day humor flicks, but not this one.It's also very efficient since the cast is perfectly matched to their roles. Steve Carrell strikes with the level of charm and humor that many comedians like Will Ferrell and Adam Sandler try and fail at since they are never given a decent script. Carrell is allowed to display his talents and he does. The fact that he physically resembles Don Adams only makes his performance more enjoyable. Anne Hathaway, one of our best actresses, is absolutely wonderful as the skeptical but soft-hearted Agent 99. Alan Arkin is tremendous as the chief, Dwayne Johnson is funny and lovable as the famous Agent 23 whom Max wants to live up to, Terence Stamp is given yet another generic bad guy to play and does so with flair and excellence. There's also a great supporting cast that includes Bill Murray, Terry Crews, David Koechner, Ken Davitian, and a hilarious bit part with James Caan as the president of the United States.Never devoid of laugh, charms, and competently directed by Peter Segal, ""Get Smart"" is one of the most delightfully funny movies of the past ten years. It's not a guilty pleasure; it's sheer energetic humor and whimsical charm. I was not disappointed.",Get Smart
85,jaredmobarak,Chuck Norris and a BB-gunGet Smart,5,22 June 2008,"It's always nice to leave a theatre thinking how much better the film you just saw was compared to what you expected it to be going in. I'm not saying that the big screen version of Get Smart is a classic work of cinema history, but when you go in thinking that the overall piece will be boring, asinine, and a waste of time, only to come out with a smile on your face, knowing that you've been entertained for two hours, it is a good feeling. Admittedly, I have never seen the television show for which this is based, so I had no real preconceptions besides what I saw in the trailers. Watching them pitch this as a comedy of errors with a bumbling imbecile trying to save the world as a spy just made me think Austin Powers, only less funny as it tries to be relevant. Thankfully, that is not what we get. The main character of Maxwell Smart is in actuality a very intelligent man who finds himself in abnormal situations. Maybe not the most socially savvy person around, he is not a moron and even though he may stumble onto moments of brilliance, it is not all by chance, he does put himself into the place where success can occur. This film is just a good time at the theatre, plain and simple.The concept is a real overblown spy espionage send-up. When based on a show that Mel Brooks had a hand in, (he is a consultant here as well), you know it will be goofy. What we get is a secret government organization called CONTROL working behind the scenes to keep the world safe with an arsenal of experienced agents and technological savvy scientists creating the latest forms of gadgetry. It has been years since the crime syndicate/terrorist unit KAOS has been active and that time has made threats by them seem like a joke; they are disbanded, why waste the time and resources? Even after CONTROL is infiltrated and identities are released, the idiots in the White House and War Room, (a who's who of B-list comedians having some fun, with James Caan as the president), can't believe it is the work of that archaic group. However, some still want to check and make sure. Since the agents have been compromised, it is up to 99, who has recently undergone full cosmetic plastic surgery, and 86Smart himselfnewly promoted to the big show, as they are not in the database that has been stolen.A contrived way to make sure that Steve Carell, (Smart), and Anne Hathaway, (99), get all the screen time, being the only agents allowed to work in the public sphere, it does lead to some funny moments as this novice goes on his first mission with an experienced professional. Sure there is some overlong slapstick work, Carell in an airplane bathroom shooting mini-harpoons into his body for ten minutes, but there are also some genuinely hilarious times to counter. When the two agents partake in a dance-off at a traditional Russian party, you can't help but laugh. The gimmick of how Carell has recently lost 150 pounds in order to become an agent comes into play, as well as numerous other times including a funny flashback scene, and he shows up Hathaway and her partner by cutting the rug with an obese woman, who also recently lost 150 pounds, (get it?). These two have some fun as they attempt to one up each other throughout, showing the gadgets they have for which the other does not, and constantly surprising each other with what they are capable of. Unfortunately many instances do fall into the territory of joke gone on too long: escaping a room of laser trips gets tedious and Smart hanging from an airplane banner through traffic becomes too far-fetched.When it works, though, this film can bring the laughs. Alan Arkin, as head of CONTROL is great. His deadpan sarcasm is his bread-and-butter and is brought out perfectly here. Terence Stamp is so nonchalant in his insults and villainy that he succeeds in being more funny than menacing while he brings KAOS back from the dead and Dwayne Johnson brings some nice swagger to the role of top-dog at CONTROL, envy of everyone. Most of the big laughs come from a rather extensive list of cameos, though. The best of these has to be Bill Murray's short stint as Agent 13 and of course the great Patrick Warburton doing what he does. I won't tell you whom he plays, but will say that fans of the show should enjoy his inclusion, (the benefit of going with someone who used to watch the show, many of the inside jokes were revealed to me).In the end, while not a movie I would run out to see again anytime soon, Get Smart delivers on what it set out to do. It is a film that has fun with itself and allows the audience to just sit back and enjoy the hijinks on display. Obvious jokes and sequences asideif you have ever seen a spy film you will know what is coming every step of the waythere is enough to not treat this as a throwaway comedy like most that have come out this year. If the filmmakers did anything absolutely right, it is the handling of Carell's character. I feared this from the previews and should not have. His role really is the glue holding the entire movie together and it works the whole way through. This is not Michael Scott from ""The Office"" trying to be a spy. No, he realizes the luck he has and the stupidity he sometimes exudes, but he never gives up on himself in order to come through as the victor. It is a role that one can relate to and makes the film that much more enjoyable.",Get Smart
86,thekarmicnomad,Not a silly as you think it is going to be.,7,17 March 2009,I love the idea of spoofs but they never live up to anywhere near my expectation (not another teen movie being the exception) They always seem to roll fall back on endless fart and orgasm jokes.I was dreading watching Get Smart and only agreed once black mailed.It is actually quite a slick and humours film. Some of the comedy seems a little worn now with the leading character being a bit of a Inspector Clueso/Mr Magoo type. But the writers have stretched out a little further and given the characters some flesh.Yes there are jokes cantered around the agent being a duffus and gadgets not working etc. But they were all tolerable and I found myself chuckling away quite a few times.I can't say Get Smart is the new Airplane for the 21st Century but you could do a lot worse. Defiantly pick this film over Scary Movie or the like.,Get Smart
87,Andy-296,Good enough,7,30 June 2008,"Get Smart is one of the best series in the history of television. While other espionage-related shows of the 60s haven't aged that well (e.g., the Man from Uncle and Mission Impossible) you can watch Get Smart on reruns without any problems. There has been a movie version of Get Smart before (the awful Nude Bomb, from 1980, with Don Adams but without Barbara Feldon) as well as two failed works for television. Adams died a couple a years ago, so for this new film version, Steve Carrell was called. Carrell is far from an extraordinary actor, but his acting style is refreshingly underhanded in comparison with the wild overacting of the likes of Will Ferrell and Robin Williams that passes for comedy these days. Anne Hathaway, as 99, is pretty but not a very good actress (and the film makers have updated her character but making it disgustingly more masculine). Alan Arkin is nothing out of the ordinary as the Chief, but far worse is Terence Stamp totally unsubstantial performance as Siegfried, the head henchman of Kaos. Anyway, the plot has Smart ascending from analyst to field agent (though the action takes place in the present, is also a prequel of sort to the series) and is sent to Russia with 99 to try to disrupt a plot of Kaos to smuggle nuclear weapons (there are some nice shots of the European country, by the way). The second part of the movie takes place in L.A. as Control tries to prevent a nuclear terrorist attempt at the president (James Caan, in a small but effective imitation of George W. Bush). Summing up, the film, at almost two hours, is a bit too long, but is enjoyable for most of its running time.",Get Smart
88,fwomp,Not Quite Campy Enough For My Taste But Still Funny Thanks To Carell,7,19 November 2008,"For those who grew up with the original GET SMART series on TV starring Don Adams, this new feature release might or might not be what you're looking for. It is definitely a hybrid of the original with perhaps not enough campiness that many viewers of the original series came to love. But let's start with what's enjoyable about this version...First is that Steve Carell (LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE) was the perfect choice to play Agent Smart. He looks and has the exact mannerisms as the original. A major boon for film. He also delivers several lines that came from the series and does so at the most appropriate times (i.e., slamming into the side of a building and then saying, ""Missed it by that much."" and ""The old whatever-it-is-that-really-isn't-old-but-Max-calls-it-old trick."").Second is the surprisingly good role of Agent 23 played by The Rock, Dwayne Johnson (BE COOL). His rugged good looks and unbelievable abilities were the perfect mix.From here, though, things start to take a turn. Anne Hathaway (HOODWINKED!) whom I normally love in just about everything she's ever been in, turns in a so-so performance as Agent 99, the love interest to Max. The chemistry never hit the right note between the two of them and I found it hard to believe the turnaround affection 99 ended up having for Max.Masi Oka (LOST) plays Bruce and Nate Torrence plays Lloyd (HOUSE M.D.), the two geeks responsible for Max's gadgets and the informational nerve center of Control. And although they had some really hysterical moments with Max  especially when they have Max pretend to beat them up  they were non-entities for the majority of the film. Their creation of the robot Hymie (Patrick Warburton, SKY HIGH) at the end of the film was pretty funny, though.I did, too, enjoy the choice of Alan Arkin (RENDITION) to play The Chief. Although over 74 years old, Arkin plays as if he's closer to 50, giving some great physical comedy, including beating up on the Vice-President.So let's get to the bigger issue with the film: it's separation from the original. Although they incorporated several sight gags for fans of the series (the cars, the original suit, the shoe phone), it came off as a big budget film and gave itself to much cred (as the street would say). The great thing about the original was how absolutely campy the sets, the language, and the crime set-ups were. Here we lose almost all of that because there's too many high-tech special effects, too much focus on a threat to the president (which wasn't really funny at all considering the times), and the seriousness of the situations rather than the ridiculousness of them (which enamored viewers of the old series).Even with these issues, though, the film does hit some great comedic high notes. And almost all of them are thanks for Steve Carell and his excellent portrayal of Max. See it for him, but don't see it if you are a die-hard fan of the campy originals.",Get Smart
89,jon.h.ochiai,Missed it by that much...,8,1 July 2008,"During the first 30 minutes or so of Peter Segal's ""Get Smart"", most of the jokes fall flat. Rather what I had recalled as funny back in the Mel Brooks and Buck Henry 1960's TV show did not seem to translate to 2008. The dry humor and wit does not replicate in effect here. I was a fan of the TV series starring Don Adams and Barbara Feldon as intrepid Agents 86 and 99. In Segal's motion picture rendition Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway are perfectly cast in the Adams and Feldon roles. However, the screenplay by Tom Astle and Matt Ember stumbles as a straight farce and comedy in the very beginning. Once ""Get Smart"" shifts into an action movie with comedic accents, does the movie gain audience traction. To that end Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is solidly funny as super CONTROL Agent 23. In the words of Maxwell Smart, the movie ""missed it by that much"".There are excellent moments in ""Get Smart"", but it is so uneven. The comedic timing seems to be just off. Dead pan Steve Carell and stunningly beautiful Anne Hathaway are both brilliant. Too bad, they get very little support from Astle and Ember's script. There is a hysterical scene where 99 (Hathaway) undulates a maze of deadly lasers, and says to Max, ""Are you staring at my butt?"" Startled Max replies, ""No, no I'm staring again."" In another funny scene Max (Carell) proclaims to 99, ""I'll have you know I am an expert in Hwa Rang Do."" Then 99 slugs Max in the face. The dueling 'dancing with the stars' sequence may soon become a cult classic.On the opposite end of the spectrum there are miscalculations. Max mistakenly smacks CONTROL Chief (funny Adam Arkin) in the head with a fire extinguisher, which then drags on beyond that. The harpoon mishap in the airline men's room runs way too long—we get the point.Conversely, Peter Segal expertly directs the action. The fight scenes are slick and polished. The skydiving scene is spectacular. Segal also uses the amazing chemistry of Carell and Hathaway in romantic and sweet effect. Almost out of place though quietly touching the vulnerable Hathaway as 99 confesses, ""I used to look like my Mom."" To which Max replies, ""I used to look like two of my moms put together."" Again it is too bad, ""Get Smart"" isn't smartly written to really leverage the talents of Carell and Hathaway.In this ""Get Smart"" Maxwell Smart is CONTROL's best intelligence analyst. CONTROL is the super secret intelligence agency thought to be long defunct since the end of the Cold War. CONTROL battles the evil KAOS, an organization bent on world domination. The head of KAOS is Siegfried (austerely hysterical Terrence Stamp). Max's dream is being a CONTROL Agent. He finally passes the Agent Exam on his eighth attempt. However, Chief (Arkin) does not want to promote Max and lose his finest analyst. Apparently, KAOS is conspiring to obtain a supply of weapons grade uranium. KAOS has also been killing off CONTROL Agents across the globe. Then KAOS destroys CONTROL Headquarters and compromises their agents' identities. The Chief is forced to activate Max as Agent 86. And it now up to Max and 99 to stop KAOS's evil conspiracy. Of course 99 is reluctant to team up with the rookie 86.""Get Smart"" is more entertaining as an action movie than straight comedy. I think Director Segal is just clumsy with the material in the beginning. This is unfortunate because Carell, Hathaway, Johnson, and Arkin bring their A-games. Carell nails the droll and way too serious Max. He also infuses Max with a sense of comic desperation that makes you cheer for him. Hathaway is strong and sexy. She demonstrates talent as a first-rate comic straight-man, and is also a versatile action star. Dwayne Johnson is charismatic and hilarious as the pompous super Agent 23. He has a great scene where he crushes a fellow agent's cell phone: ""Let me see that..."" ""Get Smart"" is an inventive homage to the classic TV series. However, instead of repackaging the series, Segal might have just reinvented it. As my bud John would say, ""You don't play rock and roll in a hip-hop world.""",Get Smart
90,Benjamin-M-Weilert,"No really big laughs, but continuous chuckling throughout.",7,8 March 2019,"While film adaptations of television shows aren't new, Get Smart (2008) was certainly in the era when the idea to do so had become popular (even if we're still trying to forget Bewitched (2005)). What's nice about Get Smart is that it falls into that ""self-aware"" category, mainly because the source material (i.e. the 1960's TV show of the same name) was already self-aware when it came to the ""spy"" genre made popular by James Bond. Of course, it's no wonder that the king of parody, Mel Brooks was involved in both the TV show and this film adaptation.Of course, while the humor was more bathroom-oriented than witty, many of Carell's lines played off of the amusing nature of taking everything literally. Also, the bumbling nature of his new field agent character, Maxwell Smart, was certainly entertaining (as it is clearly Carell's forté), even if it was abandoned at times to advance the plot through action. In fact, it did its best to not try and fall into the same old ""action movie"" genre, even if the end sequence certainly fits that bill. Sometimes the fight scenes seem out of place considering the frequency of Smart's goof-ups, but they do help keep the character at least somewhat realistic.Younger audiences will likely not understand some of the nods to the source material. I've only seen part of one episode of the original TV show, but even from that limited knowledge, I'd have to say that this film was a close proximity to the original. While it follows almost every one of the tropes of the spy genre (including the attractive woman, of which Anne Hathaway definitely fits the bill), Get Smart doesn't stand out much more than any other spy parody like The Naked Gun (1988) or Johnny English (2003). At least, as far as TV adaptations go, it wasn't Bewitched.No really big laughs, but continuous chuckling throughout, I give Get Smart 3.5 stars out of 5.",Get Smart

93,cchase,Would You Believe...An Actually Good Adaptation of a 40-Year-Old Series???,8,29 June 2008,"When THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN took off into the box-office stratosphere, and Steve Carrell was announced as the heir apparent to Don Adams' most-beloved TV role in the big screen remake, I had not a single doubt that the producers had found their man. It was EVERYTHING ELSE I was worried about. And I'm afraid the worries weren't dissolved by the funny-as-hell previews. Any moviegoer worth his or her weight in popcorn knows that preview trailers can be misleading - or even worse - they can give away all the best parts of what will turn out to be a truly dismal movie. Well, now it can be told: GET SMART is perfect summer blockbuster entertainment. Not only is it not Academy Award-worthy material, chances are that once it's over and you're still holding your sides laughing as you leave the theater to go to dinner, it will make for great conversation over the main course, and pretty much be forgotten by dessert time.But that's fine. It was designed that way, and the fact that it's so entertaining is a testament to the expert blending of all the talent involved. Just as Carrell makes an irreplaceable fill-in for Max, the rest of the casting is equally brilliant. Anne Hathaway once again gets to channel her comedic aptitude into Agent 99, Max's reliable and often-rattled ""straight woman""; Alan Arkin filling the shoes nicely of the late, great Edward Platt as Chief of CONTROL; specialty villain Terence Stamp putting his own 'stamp' on Bernie Koppell's persnickety baddie Siegfried, and in a cameo that made me wish he'd been in the movie sooner, Patrick Warburton stepping in for Dick Gautier as humanoid CONTROL agent ""Hymie"", one of the series most hysterically funny characters. (And that's saying something!)Just as it was in the series, the plot - some Bondian hooey about KAOS commandeering nuclear devices worldwide and blackmailing the U.S. for a gazillion dollars not to set them off - is not the thing. The funny-bone twisting interaction between the characters is, especially the bumbling Max, whose tendency to sometimes actually do the right thing in a sticky situation is as unpredictable and accidental, as his proclivity to get himself (and 99) into jams is a surety. The original sexual tension that was blithely one-sided between Adams and ""original 99"" Barbara Feldon is more reciprocated here, marking another sign of how times have changed since Mel Brooks and Buck Henry's spoofy confection first graced the airwaves back in the Sixties. Nice to see how the writers filled in and enhanced the original series' character matrix with some familiar faces portraying new characters (with the same kind of archetypal backgrounds): Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as the handsomely narcissistic and violence- prone Agent 23; HEROES' Masi Oka and TV commercial staple Nate Torrence as CONTROL Special Weapons nerds Bruce and Lloyd; David Koechner and Terry Crews as the boorish CONTROL ne'er-do-wells who make the pocket-protector-packin'-pair their special targets for ribbing and ridicule; James Caan cast way against type as another buffoonish, ""Bush- esquire"" Commander-In-Chief, and even veteran funnyman Bill Murray in a blink-and-you'll- miss-him appearance as...well, I'll let you see for yourself.Oh, yeah! And in a playful and most appreciated nod to the original cast, cameos by two people very important to the series (die-hard Smart fans will spot them right away. Check around here if you're not as sure or up on things.)Peter Segal (who gave us ANGER MANAGEMENT and the iffy NUTTY PROFESSOR 2) at least knows how to keep things moving, and that to make a successful action-comedy, you have to balance the two so that one never overpowers the other. Not every joke works here, and some references to the original series (the Cone Of Silence, the shoe phone) will leave some unfamiliar viewers scratching their heads. But for every gag that doesn't quite work, two more zip by to replace them and at least one will elicit a chuckle or two if not an outright belly laugh. But key to making it all work is the interplay between the cast, and most critically, the chemistry between Carrell and Hathaway, which could blow up KAOS a hundred times more than one well-placed warhead.This is summer fluff at its best and big-bucket-o'-popcorniest, and I'm actually hoping that another sequel is in the works...if it's as good as this one.",Get Smart
94,Danusha_Goska,Not As Good As TV Series; Best Part: Steve Carrell,5,22 June 2008,"""Get Smart"" was a witty, silly, stylish 1960s TV series that spoofed James Bond movies. Its style was unforgettable: the cone of silence, the shoe phone, the catchphrases like ""Would you believe"" Given its spoofing of James Bond and his Bond girls, ""Get Smart"" was also a witty take on male-female relations.""Get Smart"" the 2008 movie is nothing special. Steve Carrell, who is always wonderful, is a perfect reincarnation of Maxwell Smart, the intense, sometimes humorless, nerd-superspy. But the script and the direction give him very little to do. The movie is nowhere near as stylish as the TV series; maybe the much larger budget, lush locations, and violent action sequences vitiate the style.Alan Arkin, a brilliant comedic actor, is sadly underused as The Chief. Anne Hathaway is one of the most beautiful women alive. Maybe that's why directors don't direct her. Either that or she has no talent, because, other than being very beautiful, she does absolutely nothing on camera. She completely lacks the flair of the equally beautiful, but talented, Barbara Feldon, who played Agent 99 in the TV series.Max and Agent 99 had a terrific chemistry on the series, and I can still hear Feldon saying, ""Oh, Max,"" in a way that was exasperated, loving, and sexy all at once. And yet I don't remember their ever acting on any feelings they may have had for each other. Did they ever even kiss? In the movie, the chemistry is less and the action is greater, which is a mistake. I can't help but compare this aspect of the movie to ""Iron Man,"" in which Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts and Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark have a great rapport, but don't act on it.There are a couple of fun bits. Smart uses his intelligence to avoid being crushed by a gigantic assassin; Smart and 99 compete on the dance floor. Smart's partner is a very large woman, and she's not made a fool of, which was a relief.Not a bad movie, but, as will inevitably will said over and over, when it comes to being a really good movie, they missed it by THAT much.",Get Smart

96,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Hilarious spy spoof,8,16 July 2008,"After many recent ""movie"" movies that have greatly brought down the spoof genre it can be seen how this spoof movie could have made people think twice about getting a ticket. It didn't since it has become a hit (unlike many of the ""movie"" movies) and in seeing the film you can see why. The key is the same element that the hilarious ""Hot Fuzz"" used: tone. More specifically the tone of absurdity. This isn't just an extended series of loosely connected skits, but an actual plot with plenty of references to spy films.The other key here is that the running joke of the bumbling spy, Agent Maxwell Smart, doesn't constantly rely on vulgarity to be funny. Steve Carrell, who could have easily made ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" be a non-stop barrage of sex jokes, chose a slightly more sophisticated and witty approach to the film's humor (with Judd Apatow, of course). Here, that exploitation is also thankfully omitted and in spoofing and referencing dozens of movies this film feels fresh and thus actually enjoyable. Director Peter Segal, one of the better comedy directors working today, is also to thank and this film adds to his stream of enjoyable comedies. --- 8/10BsCDb classification: PG --- violence",Get Smart

98,gelman@attglobal.net,Go See It!,9,24 July 2008,"Some of the reviews for ""Get Smart"" were tepid. There were several that used the old ""missed it by that much"" tag-line from the original TV series to characterize this version. Ignore them. This film brings the beloved series fully up to date, retaining the spirit and, frequently, familiar pieces of dialog from the original. Steve Carrell looks very much like Don Adams and, while he's not the stand up comedian that Adams was, he does his job with great style. Anne Hathaway makes a beautiful and convincing Agent 99, and Alan Arkin is a superb choice as the Chief. Dwayne Johnson, a new character, the highly professional Agent 23, ultimately a central character in the plot, is excellent, and Terence Stamp is a splendid villain. I don't know the name of the man they got to stand in as the director of the Los Angeles Symphony but he appears as if he's ready to drop dead at any moment as he conducts Beethoven's Symphony No. 9. Nor do I know the name of the giant of a man who acts as a guard for Kaos but he too is marvelous. I won't give any of the story away; it is tightly plotted. But the strengths of ""Get Smart"" are the humor and the style, and both are intact, including the crazy gadgets which Maxwell Smart gets from Control's two techies. Even the old phone booth, the fall-through entry into HQ, is briefly on display. The critics had conditioned me to be disappointed but I wasn't. I loved every moment of it. Mel Brooks and Buck Henry the brains behind the original, are credited as consultants and whether or not they played any significant role, I am sure they must have been satisfied with the results. Peter Segal as the director and the two writers deserve immense credit for realizing this great TV series in a different era.",Get Smart
99,mario_c,In fact he's Well Smart!,7,25 April 2009,"This adaptation to the movies of the classic TV Series ""GET SMART"" doesn't disappoint, because it keeps the same line of parody to the ""Secret Agent"" genre. Like the original series, this film joins silly to intelligent humor, what makes it irresistible, but it also adds lots of action and adrenaline.MAXWELL SMART stills very funny and AGENT 99 is probably sexier than ever, but what makes this film so nice to me is that besides it is an adaptation of an excellent classic series it also is refreshing and amazingly spoofing to the ""James Bond movie type"". Personally I don't appreciate (serious!) ""Secret Agent movies"" and the recent ""James Bond fever"" has annoyed me a little bit I must confess. But this film is great because it's a total parody to the genre.Anyway, Steve Carrel does a very nice job and fits very well in the character, and some other secondary roles are very funny too (one of them is that big guy from KAOS.

With the mixed reviews I've heard, I was not even sure to see it. But I did and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It's not the greatest thing in the world, but it is certainly worth an admission ticket price.I always found Steve Carrel as a comical character, particularly in ""Dan in real Life"" and as the talented voice of Hammy in ""Over the Edge"". Likewise, he puts on the hilarious role as the bumbling idiot Secret Agent, Maxwell Smart. Not only does he deliver classic one-liners but he also uses his body making ""laugh-out-loud"" sight gags.His co-star, Anne Hathaway (Becoming Jane) is the serious and sexy Agent 99, the more competent agent. She really makes a good sidekick with Carrel; there's a lot of chemistry between the two. Alan Arkin (Gattaca) was also a great addition to the movie. He maybe old, but he's sturdy and capable as a stern and yet funny ""Chief."" Dwayne Johnson (Scorpion King) also wasn't bad pick as the tough and unpredictable Agent 23.With a great cast, they make the somewhat ridiculous plot enjoyable and the year's best action comedy. I also might add that ""Get Smart"" lacked the substantial amount of crude humor and foul language that most PG-13s have, which was nice. I will not deny that there is some, but not a boat load of. 8/10 Get Smart, see this movie!",Get Smart

I guess it's the lack of a good script I have to admit I did not see the original TV series. I watched ""Get Smart"" on DVD but scarcely raised a laugh. There's lots of action but no substance. Most of the scenes are forgettable. The dance with the fat lady led to nothing. Slightly amusing was the secret service agent Max seeking something hot from a street stall bakery. Then he was eavesdropping listening to a couple of Russians while making staccato squirts into a urinal , stopping and starting as he listened to their plotting.. At least that episode was original. Perhaps the most exciting sequence was secret service agents getting tangled in a banner flying high in the sky ""Suicide. Don't do it""..

Unfortunately, just as with CASINO ROYALE, they--the production company--make the mistake of setting it in the modern day!And, both the movie and the audience suffer for it.Oh, there are some nice homages! Like the red sports car Don Adams drove on the original TV series. Plus, Anne Hathaway's body double imitating the moves used by Catherine Zeta-Jones during the electric eye scene in ENTRAPMENT.And, there are a few belly laughs; like Alan Arkin, as the Chief, getting clobbered with a fire extinguisher. But, without the genius of Mel Brooks and/or Buck Henry behind them, those belly laughs are only slightly less infrequent than they were in 40-YEAR OLD VIRGIN.That, combined with the fact that the traitor inside Control was obviously Duane Johnson (as Agent 23), led me to leave the movie theater halfway through the film.

105,bigverybadtom,"They Tried, They Really Tried...",7,21 August 2013,"But I guess despite their best efforts, there was no way to really replace Don Adams and Barbara Feldon. Not that this movie was a disaster; it was funny, and tried to mix the spirit of the old series while modernizing it. Maybe different actors could have done better, or maybe some things cannot be duplicated. Try to imagine ""The Honeymooners"" without Jackie Gleason and Art Carney, or ""The Lucille Ball Show"" without her or Desi Arnaz. (There was a short-lived show, ""Life With Lucy"", which did have Lucille Ball in it, but it was universally panned despite having laughs.) Also, Siegfried and Shtarker were not the funny characters they were as played by the original actors.So how was the movie on its own merits? It had Agent 86 bumble but not excessively, and he was able to occasionally use his head like the original did. There were clever parts such as where 86 and 99 search for a man only for that man to come up and introduce himself, or a gadget that has many uses but only causes trouble for 86.It is still decent entertainment; the rest of the audience in the theater enjoyed it too.

106,timdalton007,Terrific Fun!,8,8 November 2008,"There have been a fair share of movies based on TV shows that have been good (the first Mission: Impossible movie) and bad (Lost In Space). Get Smart falls into the good category without a doubt. It not only manages to pay tribute to the show that spawned it but it also is a terrific blend of action and comedy.Much of Get Smart's success lies in its cast. For a long time I would have told you that nobody could replace Don Admass as Maxwell Smart but now I'd have to disagree. Steve Carell proves to be an excellent choice for Maxwell Smart. It isn't fair to Carell to call him a replacement because he makes the role his own proving (as if he hadn't all ready) that he is defiantly a comedic force to be reckoned with. The same can be said of those characters based on characters from the show, especially Anne Hathaway's 99, Alan Arkin's Chief and of course Terence Stamp as Siegfried. In fact both Carell and Hathaway have excellent chemistry together. The rest of the cast is fun as well from Dwayne Johnson to the cameos littered throughout the movie including Bill Murray and Patrick Warburton.Get Smart is a good example of how to properly mix action and comedy together. Get Smart gets past one of the big problems that many movies like this have. That problem is that either the action or the comedy overwhelms the other and tips the entire movie off balance (just look at many of the Roger Moore era James Bond movies to get my point). Get Smart manages to successfully bring the two together in a way that makes the movie both funny and (at times) actually filled with tension. Just watch the last twenty minutes or so of the movie to get my point.In fact Get Smart succeeds in keeping true to its source material while being modern at the same time. It is, for all intents and purposes, an update of the series. That said keep the following in mind please. Get Smart is loaded with references to the original series that don't alienate anyone who hasn't seen the forty year-old TV series. So if you haven't seen the series don't worry you'll enjoy this anyway.Get Smart is a whole list of things. It has a terrific cast, a terrific blend of action with comedy and it pays tribute to the original series without alienating anyone who hasn't seen it. But above all it is terrific fun.",Get Smart

After watching Get Smart on blu-ray I have to point out how bad the review is on this site (really bad at least to my eyes). Below I have highlited the issues I have noticed with the review.Get Smart bumbles onto the Bluray format in a nice 1080p/VC-1 encoded transfer with a 1:85:1 aspect ratio that overall is very pleasing, but not without some small issues. From the start the print master is completely devoid of any film based blemishes. Colors are spot on, natural, balanced and well saturated without any bleeding or chroma noise. Black levels are very deep and inky, to the point of being crushed in very dark scenes. Shadow detail was lacking in some scenes, with details being submerged into the black murk of the crush. Contrast is also a problem, with some scenes looking just a little hot to these eyes. Detail and fine detail overall is quite good in both the foreground and background. There is a fine grain structure that remains very consistent throughout the film, with no sign of DNR or additional processing to be found. Flesh tones are spot on, with no rosy faces or skewed tones. I did notice some small cases of edge enhancement, and even a very rare occurrence of aliasing on some clothing, but overall the picture quality is very good with all minor quibbles put aside.The extremely problematic parts I have highlighted in bold. Firstly, the film was shown in theatres in 1.85:1, however the blu ray like many releases by warner is opened up to 1.78:1. This admiitedly is a small issue, but the critic then says ""There is a fine grain structure that remains very consistent throughout the film"". There is absolutly no grain present in Get Smart, it was a film shot digitally (based on the motion 'artifacts' I would say with a red one camera), and there is absolutly no grain present throughout the entire film. There is some digital noise in darker scenes, but digital noise is not grain nor does it look like grain. The reviewer has missed when watching this film that it was shot digitally, which is not easy as it is not a very film like presentation and is saturated with motion artifacts that can occur when shotting with digital cameras.The above are issues that I feel need to be addressed on a website such as this, it wouldn't bother me if it was a user review. But this is meant to be a professional revie and such mistakes need to be addressed. Otherwise I agree with most other points he has made.

Get Smart is a James Bond spoof about Maxwell Smart (played in this film by Steve Carell). Max is a bumbling, overconfident, and sometimes stupid spy for the top secret government agency Control. In this film Max is sent on a mission to Russia to investigate an evil plot involving nuclear weapons. Along the way Max is joined by his partner on the mission, the beautiful Agent 99 (played by Anne Hathaway). Together the two grow closer as they try to uncover the nuclear plot of the evil organization, Kaos.Overall Get Smart was a very good film, it was funny and exciting at all the right moments. The film was well directed by Peter Segal, who utilized digital video cameras throughout majority of the film, giving it a slightly more naturalistic feel. Of course the acting is the true highlight of the film, every part, ranging from Carell as Max to Alan Arkin as the Chief of Control, was played perfectly. Then on top of that the film was well scripted, featuring some truly terrific action sequences that are very pulse pounding; in particular one sequence towards the end of the film literally uses everything imaginable in a chase scene, including: a plane, train, and car.Really I found it hard to find anything wrong with the film, my only minor complaint is that the film is slow to get started, it takes at least a good 15-20 minutes before the film truly finds its pace; but after that the film becomes a nonstop fun ride, delivering joke after joke, and then throwing cool action sequences on top of all of that. As well the film features great cameos, like: Bill Murray, Kevin Nealon, and Patrick Warburton.As a whole Get Smart is a fun summer blockbuster that is five times better than any of the other comedies released thus far this summer.I give Get Smart a fun 9 out of 10!",Get Smart

110,the-movie-guy,Brings back memories,6,19 June 2008,"(Synopsis) Maxwell Smart (Steve Carell) works as an analyst at Control, a U.S. spy agency that was supposed to have closed after KAOS was defeated. However, KAOS is far from being dead. KAOS penetrates Control and steals the names of all their field agents, and they then begin to kill Control agents around the world. The Chief (Alan Arkin) promotes Maxwell Smart, designates him Agent 87, and partners him with Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway). Smart has always wanted to be a field agent, but he wanted to be partnered with the best, Agent 23 (Dwayne Johnson). Smart is given a little training and some spy-tech gadgets to help him do his job. Smart and Agent 99 have uncovered information of where Siegfried (Terence Stamp), the sinister head of KAOS is located, and they go after him to stop him from taking over the world.(My Comment) This is an adaptation of the 1960's classic TV series to the big screen. Steve Carell enters Control through the famous doors with the phone booth at the end to begin one of our classic spy comedies. We have all the familiar characters, music, jokes, gags, gadgets, and lines that bring back memories of the TV series. Carell and Hathaway have that certain chemistry that channels the essence of the original stars, Don Adams and Barbara Feldon. However, Carell's character has changed a little from the original bumbling idiot who lucked into a good outcome into one who has a little bit of competence. Smart is still clumsy, but he has charm. The dance scene will become a classic. There are several action scenes that make this movie entertaining to watch as a spy movie, and not just as a slapstick comedy. I would suggest that you look at this movie on its own merit, and not try to compare it to the series. There was no need for Steve Carell to be exactly like Don Adams for this to be an enjoyable movie; the same goes for Anne Hathaway, because most of the audience wasn't even born when Get Smart was on TV.

111,policy134,Really funny ...and smart too,8,6 January 2009,"Very clever and you don't need to have seen the series on which it is based to enjoy it. There is a tendency for comedies today to gross you out or give you disturbing images, just for schock value, so it was refreshing to see this where those jokes are pretty much left out.Instead, the actors rely on observational humour. Terence Stamp plays the villain but his character is very aware of how frustrating it can be to have henchman that are completely incompetent. That also goes for the heroes. Alan Arkin plays the Chief of Control, complaining about how the Vice President thinks that his agency is inept and wants to shut it down.Now to rave about Steve Carell. He is absolutely the best comic actor working today. Forget Will Ferrell or even Jim Carrey. What is so good about him here is that you actually buy him as an agent. He is kind of a nerd but he looks convincing in a tuxedo. Anne Hathaway as 99 - not bad either and you actually don't think it's ridiculous that she could be attracted to Smart. There is a sweet moment where she warns him about trust that will pay off at the end of the movie.The special effects are quite good too but they don't take center stage. The fun comes from the way the characters are semi-real human beings who are put in extreme situations but somehow almost plausible. The train thing was a little hard to believe, though and also quite boring if not for a great line that comes at the end.So, see this and enjoy. You will definitely laugh.",Get Smart
112,doctorsmoothlove,Get Smart and go see it!,7,10 July 2008,"Cold War paranoia must have permeated American culture in its entirety last century. I can't speak out of personal experience since I was only alive for the last half of 1989, but the emergence and popularity of Ian Flemming's James Bond novels as well the apocalyptic lyrics of many metal songs from the era has given me some understanding of the pressure America felt at that time. It would then seem only natural that zany Mel Brooks would conceive an idea to poke fun at this uneasiness in the form of a parody spy show. He created Get Smart which became memorable for irreverent one-liners and not actually-incompetent spies. Thus in the void known as Warner Brothers Studios creativity, a new film based on the show has emerged. Why not update Get Smart? The Dukes of Hazzard and Bewitched have already been updated so why cash in on another cultural icon? Well, despite my fear of another horrendous TV-film, Get Smart is actually a decent motion picture. It relies on Steve Carell's comedic charm and Anne Hathaway's tight pants to keep audiences entertained (for the most part). The film also has Mel Brook's full endorsement.Steve Carrel plays Maxwell Smart and later Agent 86 who is the best data analyst for the secret US intelligence agency called CONTROL which is at war with a Russian similar Russian agency called KAOS (isn't the spelling cute). Smart wants to become an agent like his idol Agent 23(Dwayne ""not the Rock"" Johnson) but cannot since he is very skilled as an analyst. One day he reports to work to find his headquarters attacked and is one of the few remaining living members. So Smart becomes Agent 86, and is paired with the femme-fatale-like Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway). The two go to Russia to investigate the nuclear capacities of KAOS and Smart attempts to impress 99 with his field agent skills (which while unimpressive still manage to be amusing). He learns that 99 doesn't wish to pursue a romantic relationship with another agent since her fallout with 23. The two heroes locate a Russian nuclear facility and Smart destroys it. Agent 23 travels there and reports that he found no nuclear evidence at the site and Smart is imprisoned as a suspected double agent.We learn that the leader of KAOS, Siegfried (why do so many villains have this name) has threatened to sell nuclear armaments to dictators and destroy Los Angles if our government doesn't pay him a large sum of money. We don't do it so Smart is forced to break out of high-security prison and do the dirty work of our incompetent government. It is revealed that Agent 23 is a double agent and accosts 99. Smart rescues her and saves the city thereafter.All joking aside, Get Smart actually manages to appeal to a wide range of comedic interest. There are masochistic jokes (86 trying to jump out of the airplane to land in Russia), marital jokes (a KAOS agent has problems with his wife and asks 86 for help), Mel Brooks humor (how do I get him to take the life-ending pill) and sissy man jokes (see computer analysts). In addition to the humor, the movie also boasts impressive free-fall cinematography and a visceral car chase at its end. All of this is accompanied by Carrel's perky performance that doesn't appear staged. Hathaway reminded me of her earlier roles in the Princess Diary films. She manages to be funny without trying to be much like Carrel does. It was also nice to see that both the protagonists have a relationship with some (albeit thin) characterization. 86 and 99 spend some time discussing their backgrounds which I didn't expect in a teen-oriented summer comedy (though we learn little of Smart himself).I was a bit surprised at why Dwayne Johnson decided to appear in a comedy immediately after he dropped his nickname. People will have difficulty accepting this change given his silly role. I would have recommended that he take a serious Ang-Lee type of role as his first after the nickname. Even though he's a normal person again, he doesn't present the comedic effervescence of Carrel and Hathaway. He is only funny when others around him say or do something amusing, and even then, he doesn't present anything for the non-teenage audience. Although I must admit that after learning about his relationship with 99, I can wholly sympathize with Smart's sexual insecurity.Get Smart is a surprisingly effective summer hybrid movie. It's either a comedy with some intense action sequences or a really funny action film. Either way it still kept my interest as well as those in theater with me. It is a tad predictable and inconsistent (in its numerous types of mostly younger-audience humor) but worth a Saturday rental. As far as TV adaptations in 2008, Get Smart is recommended over Sex and the City because it (supposedly) maintains the appeal of the original program while providing something for first-time viewers.

To be honest this movie might have been better if Daune Johnson had been cast as Smart instead of Steve Carrell.

118,Shattered_Wake,A funny film that's true to the original source material,7,6 July 2008,"'Get Smart' stars Steve Carrell ('The Office') as Maxwell Smart, an intelligence analyst thrown into the world of agent life when an attack on Control HQ leaves him as one of the few remaining available employees to take the job. So, teaming up with Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway), Maxwell heads to take out terrorist organization Chaos. However, things aren't as smooth as they seem as the agency grows more and more complex.The film itself is good. It sticks to the original source material, it's funny, and the action's not bad. That alone makes it work as what it is. . . but, there were a few problems that knocked the quality down a few notches for me, and most of it was from the writing. The comedy relied more on a quality than quantity as it wasn't, at all, funny all the way through. There were some EXTREMELY hilarious parts, but I also found myself not laughing for 10, 15 minutes at a time. That's rarely a good sign. Also, some of the dialogue, especially for characters other than Maxwell and 99, was pretty bad. 'Side chatter,' if not done well, can bring a movie down pretty hard. In this, the side talk was just terrible. It got better as the film progressed, but at points it was laughable at how bad it was, and not at how funny it was.But, in the end, it was a funny film with good action and that's what it needed to be.Final Verdict: 7/10.",Get Smart
119,dfle3,A funny movie with great action scenes,7,16 July 2008,"This is probably the second big screen outing for the TV sit-com originating comedy/spy series ""Get Smart"". I remember seeing ""The nude bomb"" as a kid-either at the cinema or at the drive-in (don't have time to explain what ""drive-ins"" are kiddies!). If you would like to see the buttocks of the original stars of that show, that's the one to go for!Anyway, this new movie is a sort of re-imagining of the TV show-in other words you get to see the origins of the good spies' Agent 86 and Agent 99 pairing (played by Steve Carell as Maxwell Smart and Anne Hathaway). The original TV show probably worked better for kids-Don Adams had a highly stylised sound and manner which Carell doesn't replicate. And, unlike Adams' Smart, Carell's Smart actually is smart. Adams' Smart was always unfortunate in not having someone really stupid to fall for his bluff and bluster. Carell's Smart, however, delivers the same catch-phrases (which fans of the original TV show will no doubt look out for and enjoy) but they have a different spin-he knows his goose his cooked and the jig is up when he says them.Anne Hatheway makes a good Agent 99-she seems to share many traits of the lovely Barbara Feldon (the original TV show 99)-same kind of beauty, breathy, sensual voice, and hair colour. In fact, you could imagine the pitch for this movie: ""Hey, doesn't Steve Carell look like Don Adams in his younger days? Why not do a ""Get Smart"" movie with him as Smart and someone who looks like Barbara Feldon as Agent 99?"". From memory, Hatheway's Agent 99 is more the 'kick-arse' heroine than Feldon's 99...not that Feldon's 99 wasn't handy with a gun.As I mentioned, this remake isn't as stylised as the original as far as performances go. Thus, Terence Stamp's Siegfried is sort of a watered down version of the original TV series version. Interestingly, Dick Cheney gets to play a good guy in this movie: ""The Chief"" (of the good spy agency ""CONTROL"").The humour in this movie is of the physical variety/visual joke kind. Action packed, with some James Bond 'homage' scenes which are very good. In fact, if you're not a fan of this movie's humour, it works very well as a pure action movie, with great set-pieces.Surprisingly, there was a funny scene in the promotion for this movie which wasn't in the movie itself...perhaps that is being saved for the DVD release, which is a bit disappointing (I'm speaking of the shoe phone ""Shhhh!"" scene).",Get Smart
120,TaylorYee94,"It's funny, and you know it",7,9 October 2021,"Steve Carell is funny, and that is a fact.

121,majikstl,Got Smart? Not smart enough!,6,30 June 2008,"This movie version of GET SMART has at least one good gag. At one point, Steve Carell as superspy Maxwell Smart tries to steal a succession of cars; the joke being that the cars -- a Sunbeam Tiger, an Opel GT and a VW Karmann Gia -- happen to be duplicates of the three that Don Adams, the real Maxwell Smart, drove during the course of the original TV series back in the 1960s. Most viewers won't get the joke -- or appreciate the irony that the best things in the film have simply been stolen from the TV series.The problem with making new movies from old TV shows is that they exist because of the nostalgia for the old show but must be made to satisfy younger filmgoers who likely feel no great nostalgia for the originals. That's why most of them fail so badly; they usually ignore or trash the essential elements of the beloved originals, aliening one segment of the audience; while desperately trying to capture the fickle attention (and greater box office clout) of a different generation who likely won't quite get the jokes.""Get Smart,"" the television show, may not be entirely a relic of the past -- it has after all been in syndicated reruns for some forty years, but that doesn't mean that it is all that fresh in the public's mind. As one of the smart-dumb sitcoms of 1960s American TV, it holds a warm spot in the heart of many a post-baby boomer, who remembers it's cheeky silliness as something fresh and original. But, while subsequent generations might have a passing acquaintance with the material, they likely have their own favored pop culture icons, which, no doubt, greatly overshadow ""Get Smart"" reruns.As such, there wasn't any great demand to revive ""Get Smart,"" yet again -- no more so than there was a demand for big screen versions of ""Bewitched,"" ""Lost in Space,"" ""The Avengers,"" ""Car 54,"" ""The Honeymooners,"" ""The Wild Wild West,"" or any of the others on the seemingly endless list of disastrous remakes. Yet, this is the fourth attempt to resurrect the series, following a previous theatrical movie in 1980, a made-for-TV movie in 1989 and a subsequent short-lived revival series in 1995. They all failed to one degree or another, but at least they had one thing in their favor; the participation of some of the people who made the original work so well. This 2008 version lacks not just the late, great Don Adams and his lovingly bemused costar, Barbara Feldon, but even any attempt to recapture their marvelous comic chemistry. Carell opts not to imitate the distinctive style of Adams, and as such there is nothing at all particularly interesting about his interpretation of Smart. He delivers Max's trademark one-liners (""Would you believe...?"" ""Missed me by that much!,"" etc.) without a hint of Adams' cocky self-assurance, repeatedly missing the opportunity to get a sure-fired laugh, or at least a meager grin of recognition. Perhaps to avoid making Agent 99 simply Max's straight woman, the role has been beefed up so the character is now sort of Max's mentor, an awkward nod to feminism that denies Anne Hathaway a chance to recreate the coy, sardonic charm that Feldon brought to the part. As for Alan Arkin as ""The Chief"" and Terrence Stamp as archvillain Siegfried, neither actor seems to be aware that they are indeed in a comedy; especially Stamp whose whole performance makes less of an impression than the welcome five-second cameo made by Bernie Koppell, TV's Siegfried.Like the embarrassing PINK PANTHER reboot starring Steve Martin, the film thinks it is necessary to do the unnecessary, reintroduce everything. We already know that Maxwell Smart is an idiot, but not a complete idiot, and that Agent 99 is both his somewhat smarter partner and love interest. So why does this film waste so much time with formula plotting about Maxwell earning his credentials and going on his first assignment, followed by all the romantic comedy shtick showing us Max and 99 meeting, becoming rivals and then falling in love? We know all that -- and even if we don't, it is preordained anyway. And once the story does finally get going, it is a tiresomely contrived been-there-seen-that story about a plot to set off a nuclear bomb and kill the president. But rather than using these formula clichés as the starting point for satire -- like the TV series would have -- the clichés are the story.On it's own, GET SMART is not too awfully bad; that is to say that if you could forget about the TV show, the movie is as perfectly professional and perfectly forgettable as any unsold TV pilot. But, coming on the heels of the AIRPLANE! movies, the NAKED GUN movies, the HOT SHOTS! movies, the Austin Powers movies and the sundry other parodies and spoofs that owe a great debt to the MAD Magazine mentality of the original ""Get Smart,"" the movie is depressingly tame. Rather than gleefully being absurd and surreal in its approach, GET SMART is closer in tone to the James Bond movies than to the TV series that was designed to mock the James Bond movies. It is a cliché-riddled movie, based on a TV series that existed to mock cliché-riddled movies. It doesn't just fail to be as funny as the series, it actually seems to be trying to not be too funny. And that may just be the most absurd and surreal thing about the whole film.",Get Smart

She's another one of those women who just seem like an impossible mix of rare qualities. Steve Carell may be the perfect Maxwell Smart, as you've already probably guessed. Dwayne Johnson adds a lot to the movie and you kind of wish his part was even larger. The movie itself is a fair representation of the original TV show which was too silly for me. This reincarnation is much more palatable and it's easy to fall into its goofy goings-on. One of the highlights is a dance-off between Max and Agent 99 with Max paired up with a very large, but apparently quite graceful, woman which is pulled off brilliantly. The bottom line is, this is bound to become a franchise, and a very successful one, as there appears to have the talent to put up interesting story lines and not just goofy slapstick.",Get Smart

I think I remember Don Adams being klutzier than Carell was though.But there were some really funny moments from the film. I loved the dance scene with the big woman.

There's some action, weak jokes and a thin plot- and that's about it. Carell mails it in like never before, but he wasn't given much to work with. A hastily put together script is the movie's biggest issue, which is a shame considering the esteem the show is held in worldwide.

131,TheHonestCritic,Does this movie do the original TV show justice? Check out my review below to find out!,10,11 October 2021,"""Get Smart"" (2008), for those who may not know this already, the original TV show ""Get Smart"" (1965-1970) is one of my top ten favorite TV series of all-time. So, as you can imagine, I had very high expectations when I went to go see this film in the movie theater. I wasn't really that keen on seeing it at first. But, when I found out that Mel Brooks and Buck Henry (creators of the original show) were consultants for this film, that finally sparked my interest. On top of that, Steve Carell is one of my top ten favorite comedy actors and I thought he suited the role of Maxwell Smart perfectly. Plus, the casting looked promising for the characters. I went to go see it, and sure enough, it was much better than I thought it would be. This is one of those rare remakes/reboots that is every bit as good as the original source material. Eventually, it found an exclusive place on my top ten all-time favorite comedy films list! ""Get Smart"" has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and also a phenomenal soundtrack to tie it all together. The plot is, Maxwell Smart gets promoted to spy status as Agent 86 in CONTROL and is teamed up with Agent 99 to help prevent an extremist attack from the criminal spy agency known as KAOS. I won't go into any extra details about the story. But, trust me when I say that it has a perfect blend of comedy and action all the way from beginning to end! There are a few differences between this movie and the original show. This film has more action and violence, plus, since it's PG-13 rated, there is a bit of language. The original show does have action and fight scenes in it. However, it does not have any language at all whatsoever. I was kind of worried that the extra violence and language would ruin the charm of the original show. But, much to my surprise, it made this film all the more exciting and fitting for the modern world. Every action and fight scene is a blast to watch, plus, the language just accentuates the comedy for me. I was pleasantly surprised by that! Most remakes/reboots have to make changes to fit in with modern times. Thankfully, ""Get Smart"" never goes overboard with it's modernization. In my opinion, it's a perfect mix of old school and new school that will please people of all generations! All of the acting here is exceptional, from the whole entire cast! Steve Carell is perfect as Maxwell Smart. Anne Hathaway is outstanding as Agent 99, Alan Arkin is fantastic as The Chief, Terence Stamp is brilliant as the villainous Siegfried, you get the picture! Every cast member is perfectly casted for their respectable characters, and they all nail it with their performances. There is even a cameo appearance from Bernie Kopell, who played Siegfried in the original TV show, which was cool to see! The rest of the cast is just as exceptional with their acting. Their chemistry on the screen is impeccable! All of the sets/locations are perfect and give the film a beautiful atmosphere. As far as the special effects go, they are all perfect and still hold up today. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Trevor Rabin is perfect and it helps set the perfect tone for the movie. His film score really brought the movie to life. Trevor Rabin has written and composed many great film scores, and this one is no exception. ""Get Smart"" is a comedy masterpiece in the world of cinema and it belongs on my top ten all-time favorite comedy films list for good reasons. It retains the charm of the original TV show, but adds a modern twist for a neat change of pace. As I mentioned, it's one of those rare remakes/reboots that does the original TV series justice. I can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. I'm giving this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Get Smart"", what are you waiting for? Go and see it today, especially if you're a fan of the original show. If you don't want to see it, CONTROL may make you their next mission! I personally guarantee that you'll enjoy this movie just as much as I do. You'll find yourself fully invested and intrigued while watching this film, and loving it!",Get Smart
132,mnpollio,A lurching mediocrity and a miscast leading man,4,15 August 2012,"A film version of the hit TV comedy series Get Smart seemed a foregone conclusion once such things became the norm. And in the right hands, a successful rendition was possible. Unfortunately, that is not what happens here. The TV show, which was a lampoon of 1960s spy films, featured extensive slapstick and verbal comedy thanks to the chronic ineptitude of CONTROL agent Maxwell Smart (played indelibly by Don Adams). Smart was ably supported by the adoring Agent 99 (the beautiful Barbara Feldon) and was often the thorn in the side of the laconic Chief (the great Edward Platt).The film takes the same relative set-up and conspires a reason for why amateur agent Smart gets promoted to the field. This time around Steve Carell takes on the role of Smart and he is paired with the initially reluctant Anne Hathaway as Agent 99. The story is as thin as cheese cloth, but it does not need to be deep if the comedy bits work. More often than not, they don't.The pacing of the film is all over the map. Director Segal does not demonstrate much aptitude for choreographing slapstick, so it often comes out of left field and seems clumsy. He does slightly better with the more serious action scenes...but serious action scenes have no place in a Get Smart movie. At times in the latter half of the film, one feels they inadvertently wandered into Mission: Impossible rather than a comedy.Hathaway is a fairly good choice for 99. She has the beauty, appeal and is able to mimic Feldon's delivery to a good extent. Unfortunately, there is no chemistry with her older co-star and she actually seems funnier when she is annoyed by Smart than when she is enamored of him. Apparently the screenwriters did not understand the dynamics of the role of the Chief, and rather than a buffet of deadpan comedy, Alan Arkin gets stuck basically playing an upbeat cheerleader to Smart. The less said about Terence Stamp and Ken Davitian as Siegfried and Shtarker, the better. And why Dwayne Johnson is in this film in any capacity is anyone's guess.The biggest hurdle was finding someone to at least halfway capture the spirit of Adams in the title role and Steve Carell is woefully off base. Part of the problem lies with the screenplay. Sometime Smart is depicted as inept, while other times he is surprisingly adept, which makes no sense. Like Inspector Clouseau, Maxwell Smart was a character of divine nincompoopery, who legitimately thought he was a great spy and constantly failed his way into success. If Adams for one moment gave away the game that he was aware of his idiocy, then the project would have failed. By contrast, this version envisions Smart as a nice guy with low self-esteem who thinks he might be able to be a good agent if only given the chance. He is too aware of when he screws up and spends too much of the film in an earnest puppy dog mode trying to make amends and win over his fellow agents. This is not the character from the TV series and it is definitely not the character that is needed to carry this film to comic glory. Carell may be likable, but he is rarely funny here. And a Get Smart movie featuring an earnest, unfunny Maxwell Smart, is no Get Smart at all.For a feature adaptation of Get Smart, one would do better to check out The Nude Bomb. It is uneven and misses the participation of Feldon and Platt, but it does feature Adams in full buffoonishness and more laughs in 30 minutes than this adaptation manages in its whole running time.",Get Smart
133,Eternality,"Even though Get Smart has its moments, it's never a top-notch action-comedy. It will get plenty of laughs though, but it is never enough.",7,18 August 2010,"Peter Segal's remake of the hit TV series, Get Smart, is less of a nostalgic affair than expected. The effort is there for all to see though. Running at slightly less than two hours, Segal's movie still feels a tad too long. I'm not complaining though, because it's definitely a hell lot better (and shorter) than Sex And The City (another TV-to-cinema transition). Steve Carell plays a bumbling secret agent with a face of a statue. During scenes which require him to show physical emotion, his deliberate stoic facial expression is a constant source of hilarity.The chemistry between Carell and Anne Hathaway is sizzling, which is an important factor that elevates Get Smart into something more than a derivative action-comedy. While Adam Sandler shows he's past his prime in the new comedy, Don't Mess With The Zohan, fellow comedian Carell proves that he has what it takes to last the distance than Sandler. Hathaway, apart from being eye candy, plays her role more effectively than most Bond girls would have accomplished. The strong references to Bond pictures in Get Smart should end just there. There is no need for a comparison. Get Smart is played for laughs, while 007 films are action-thrillers.Get Smart has several laugh-out-loud dialogue sequences including an unforgettable one in which Carell's character meets two armed Russian baddies in their 'nuclear facility'. The action sequences are at times unrealistic (especially the 'parachuting' part) though technically quite well done. However, the attempt to infuse loads of humorous material into action scenes takes it toll after a while. The climactic scene in the concert hall is reminiscent of Hitchcock's own take in The Man Who Knew Too Much. Even though Get Smart has its moments, it's never a top-notch action-comedy. It will get plenty of laughs though, but it is never enough.SCORE: 6.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",Get Smart

135,stormhawk2021,Betrays the spirit of the original,4,25 May 2017,"A big disappointment I took after watching this film. Before I saw, I've wondered if it would see the good Peter Segal, the one who supplies his comedies with picaresque dialogues, politically incorrect and hilarious scenes (Tommy Boy, Anger Management), or in contrast, I would find the bad Peter Segal or less good (The Nutty Professor 2). Unfortunately I ran into the second. Without being among the worst adaptations of old television series, the fact is that Get Smart is boring and I do not think it satisfies the expectations of any of the fans of the series. We can analyze the film from two points of view, as an adaptation and as a film in itself, and neither is very favorable to the film.The spirit of the series is closer, paradoxically, to the character of Johnny English or Inspector Clouseau, than to this Maxwell Smart, allegedly legitimized and reconverted into a secret agent cash. The series, a successful success in the 70's, was pleasing to the world by its ability to laugh at the cold war, to ridicule the secret agents, both the Americans and the Russians. And among all that endless ridiculous characters was the character played by a fabulous Don Adams, a chaotic agent, with the logic of a four-year-old and solutions taken by the hair led to a wonderful absurd. Here, the character of Steve Carell, a recognized comedian in ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and the TV show ""The Office"", is closer to James Bond than to Smart, meticulous, with excellent grades, practically without fail in his searches and with incredible abilities. This characterization of the character limits his comedy and the development of the plot until it becomes vulgar and boring. The same goes to the agent 99 (Anne Hathaway), shown as a Milla Jovovich-like superwoman, nothing to do with the adorable Barbara Feldon. From her, I thought that the time of ""The Princess Diaries"" has left behind, being surpassed by her sober interpretations in films like ""Brockeback Mountain"" or later ""Rachel Getting Married"". Nor do the rest of the characters remember too much their original characters, the case of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson it's more serious, bad affair. The only actor who does well in this movie, is the experienced Bill Murray.I do not know where that tendency comes from adapting series without respecting its original tone. I still do crosses with the adaptation of ""Starsky and Hutch"" moving the most intense television thriller from ""The Streets of San Francisco"" to a minor comedy show. Or the loss of contact with the reality of ""Charlie's Angels"", or the minor tone of ""Miami Vice"", or...finally a lack of respect with the followers of the series and also with the creators of the same, although at least they will have received economic compensation. The second point of view of criticism is as independent film. The film is boring, its plot is predictable and the outcome is seen to satiety. I do not know why action and comedy films like ""Catch Me If You Can"" have that tendency to end up in a threatened auditorium. But there are moments of this film in which one thinks to have had a ""dejá vu"" or to have accidentally touched the remote control of the television and to have changed to another movie. At the end there is a sense of intranscendence and wasted time.If not for this detail the movie could have been titled ""Agent Cody Banks 30 years after"" or any crap like that.",Get Smart

Carrell ""does"" Michael Scott from ""The Office"" but without the supporting cast, and since the character is totally out of place in this setting, he falls flat.The only thankful thing is that this was at least not obscene as ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" was, so while it distances me even more from The Office and least it helps blur the other drek from my mind a little more. The writers don't even bother to have studied the series and respect the fans enough to build the plot of the already married couple into this plot, instead acting as if they're only just getting together...yet it is years after the previous KAOS disbanded...yet people have the same names...Errr....Everyone else has used my clever puns and ""one liners"" so I won't bother.

137,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,Gotta love that Steve Carell,9,21 June 2008,"Why do critics just anger me so much? They have NO CLUE what they are talking about. What are they expecting from this film? Oscar worthy material? If any non critic thinks this movie is the ""worst film of the year"", they have no sense of humor. To put it simple, Get Smart is slick, idiotic, priceless, and obviously hilarious. There's a laugh in every scene, meant for everyone from the kids to the adults. This is a good film for the whole family. I enjoyed every second of it, even if it does drag a bit. The performance of Steve Carell, not to mention the chemistry between Carell and Anne Hathaway, makes this movie a wonderful comedy and a faithful translation from the small screen to the big screen.Let's start with the good. Steve Carell. Well, the guy is truly one of the top comedic talents working today, and Get Smart only furthers that truth. He injects his own brand of humor into the classic Maxwell Smart without forgetting about Don Adams legendary take on the character. It's brilliant. You'll love him throughout the whole movie. Anne Hathaway...man, this lady just knows what everyone likes. There's not a bad thing about her. She's quickly becoming one of my favorite actresses. This is definitely her sexiest role, and there's many moments where the young men will be gazing at her. Dwayne Johnson puts on some slick and funny moments, but it's getting repetitive. I need that breakout performance from him...he's becoming like Vince Vaughn...same character, different movie. Alan Arkin is nothing but a bonus, and Terrence Stamp makes a good villain. There's also a few good cameos. Wait for the man in the tree.I love the diversity in the jokes. There's typical Carell style humor, then slapstick, clever, physical, and of course, sexual comedy as well. The action is also top notch, and it rivals a lot of the supposedly ""good"" action films out there right now. I enjoyed it a lot.The bad...well there's not a lot. The first would be the inclusion of WWE wrestler Great Khali. He's REALLY out of place, and despite a few funny moments, I felt he detracted from the film. I also was not a fan of the random characters that popped in and out. Though I know they were going for the James Bond feel, which has a lot of bit parts, it doesn't work here. But for me to say anything else would be nitpicking at details to fill up space.All in all, Get Smart is stylish, slick, and hilarious. Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway make a great team, and a great movie that everyone can enjoy. It's a great exercise in all kinds of great humor that the audience will love. You know what else we'd love? A sequel. Get on it, Warner Bros.",Get Smart
138,Jay_Exiomo,Missed greatness by that much,6,20 June 2008,"Watching ""Get Smart"", a big screen adaptation of a TV series that ran when I wasn't even a single cell, I didn't have the same kind of approach other members of the audience had in watching the film - mainly bordered more on nostalgia of a satire of the Cold War. Instead, I was geared more on a film that's supposedly a blend of action and comedy starring one of the more endearing actors active in the industry: Steve Carell.Carell plays Agent Maxwell Smart, a hardworking analyst for the secret organization CONTROL, who's eager for a promotion as a field agent. When the existence of CONTROL is jeopardized, Smart is eventually sent to the field to investigate a suspicious activity by KAOS, CONTROL's archenemy. He is partnered with Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway) and together, they engage themselves in some explosive scenarios.While Carrell fits the role well and manages to give the film most of its charisma, director Peter Segal and screenwriters Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember struggle to find the right balance between humor and action, never really gaining a foothold on either. There are intermittent laughs and the action scenes are somewhat diverting but the overall effect feels wanting. The twist is so painfully obvious you could see it a mile away.Hathaway doesn't have the requisite chemistry with Carell for their relationship to ignite sparks and the supporting cast comprised of Alan Arkin as the CONTROL head, Terence Stamp as the KAOS head, and Dwayne Johnson as Agent 23 are wasted with hit-or-miss dialogs.""Get Smart"" doesn't end up as being a horrible movie as surely, there are some moments worthy of a matinée. But it's a material that smells like it could have gotten a better treatment.",Get Smart
139,Chalice_Of_Evil,The old remake-of-a-classic-60s-sitcom trick...,7,26 June 2008,"I used to watch repeats of the old Get Smart TV series (starring Don Adams and Barbara Feldon) when I was growing up. It was a classic. Hearing that it was being remade into a new film version filled me with a certain feeling of dread. When the trailer for the movie came out, however, it showed promise. The movie itself is actually very good.Would you believe...pretty good? How about alright? It's funny, but not uproariously so. I will admit, I laughed out loud on more than one occasion (I even kept snickering to myself for a while after a joke had finished). The humour is pretty much what you'd expect. Some jokes work better than others (whilst some just simply fall flat). On the whole, though, the jokes succeed more than fail - and that's what's important in a movie that is based on a comedic series (that the humour is maintained).Most of the credit for the film's success has to go to Steve Carell. He doesn't do an *imitation* of Don Adams' portrayal of the character (which is a GOOD thing), but instead presents us with his own take on the character of Maxwell Smart. Oftentimes, this kind of re-creation of a much-beloved character can blow up in the actor's face. Carell, however, is perfectly suited to the role. His deadpan style of humour fits the character well and provides the majority of the laughs throughout the film. In lesser hands, this character reinterpretation could have proved to be a dismal failure.The unflappable straight person role of Agent 99 - to Carell's bumbling Agent 86 - is admirably portrayed by Anne Hathaway. The only problem is, while the Barbara Feldon incarnation of the character was levelheaded and saved Max from himself on more than one occasion, she still loved Max (in spite of his buffoonish nature), whereas 99 in the movie is a bit of a stone-cold you-know-what, and isn't as likable as Barbara Feldon's 99. Having said that, Hathaway and Carell work well together and have good on-screen chemistry.Other players (like Alan Arkin as the Chief, Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson as Agent 23, and CONTROL's resident nerds - Bruce and Lloyd - played by Masi Oka and Nate Torrence) provide good support for the leads. Larabee (David Koecher) is good for a few laughs early on, but he kind of wears out his welcome towards the end. At least he fares better than Terence Stamp (who is pretty much wasted as Max's arch-enemy Siegfried). The character had a LOT of potential, but most - if not ALL - of his jokes proved to be unfunny. His henchman, Shtarker, wasn't a whole lot better (apparently, they don't do humour at KAOS). There are some other unexpected appearances by certain characters, that are a nice nod to the old series (while never being fully realised/used to their full potential).The action is pretty run-of-the-mill (and kind of feels forced in a movie such as this), save for one high-speed chase involving planes, trains and automobiles. The film includes most of Max's catchphrases, as well as some blink-and-you'll-miss-them homages to the old series. While I felt that the film lost some steam towards the end, it remained pretty consistent with the level of laughs the rest of the time. This movie certainly wasn't like the numerous attempts to remake old sitcoms that have come before it. It succeeds where most of those have failed. So get on your shoe phone and tell other fans of the Get Smart TV series that this movie is worth checking out.",Get Smart
140,paudie,Not as good as the original series,6,31 March 2009,Steve Carell's (he is an executive producer) movie version of Get Smart is a good DVD for a night in. It is funny but there are very few belly laughs in it. The cast are all good but the script doesn't really give them a chance to shine. Carell doesn't opt to even try a Don Adams impression and Smart isn't half as incompetent and dimwitted as the original. In fact he is Control's best analyst and that's the only reason he is not a field operative. However after the Control HQ is attacked by KAOS he joins up with Agent 99 to track down the culprits. That's about all you need to know about the plot. There are a few funny moments but think an opportunity was lost to make a really funny movie with a good cast. I think the film lacks the anarchic touch of Mel Brooks and Buck Henry that made the original series such a treat.,Get Smart
141,dobbin-4,The Impossible has been done.,8,29 June 2008,"The aim was a simple to the hear, but extremely hard to manage. The aim was to remake the great 60's and early 70's show ""Get Smart"" and frankly, little to no people thought it would have a chance of being very good. So with fans of the show watching their every move, they hired Steve Carell as Agent 86, Anne Hathaway as 99 and The Rock as 23.The film was actually quite good, it held up really well as its own movie and as a tribute to the old show and Don Adams. The humour was fresh and did not rely to heavily on the old show (Although some jokes were from the old show but used in a playful manner so as to remember the old show).The show could definitely have been a lot worse and in most ways it succeeded, and really I cant see why not many people liked it unless they were expecting it to be as good as the show and to me, the concept is quite ridiculous.Overall, the show was quite funny for a laugh, and had good enough action to keep that half of the fans enthused as well, also, you do not have to have seen the show to be able to watch this, you will love everything in this film if you love the art of comedy. I rate it 78%.",Get Smart
142,vranger,Loads of fun,9,3 July 2009,"Although Get Smart has plenty of easy laughs in it, there are many places where the laughs are rather subtle and you have to both be paying attention and get what they are spoofing. Those laughs are probably the biggest if you spot them.What can you say about Steve Carell? In remakes of this type it is easy for the movie actor to come up short of the legend created out of the popular TV role. (Will Smith as James West anyone?) As much as I enjoyed Don Adams in the TV series, Steve Carell one up's him and is a better Maxwell Smart than Adams was.Anne Hathaway obviously studied Barbara Feldon's Agent 99 quite a bit, because there are lines in the movie where you could swear that a younger Feldon had been plugged in. She's spot on in the role.The movie pays homage to Don Adam's most famous repeat bits without overdoing it one bit. The story is engaging, and the action is very well done, although you'll struggle to recognize that because they don't let up on the comedy accelerator even in the middle of action scenes that would be the most tense in any other film.The Blu-ray rendition of the film is a delight to watch. I don't go through special features often, so I won't comment on those, although we did watch the outtake/gag reel and it was worth the time spent to watch it ... twice.We have now watched this film several times as we played it for ourselves, and then various sets of family and friends. We enjoy it just as much with each repeated viewing ... a solid accomplishment for any film, and even more so for a comedy.Obviously, if you like comedies this is highly recommended. If you were a fan of the Get Smart TV series, its must see.",Get Smart

146,Thats_some_scary_stuff_Reviews,A daily comment from Midget Emma: Get Smart (2008),8,2 August 2008,Much funnier than i thought it was going to be. One of the most fun movies to come out in the last year. I have never seen the TV show but I'm pretty sure it will satisfy the fans.Steve Carrell felt like he was playing the 40 year old virgin with a gun. I didn't think Anne Hathaway was the best choice to be in the supporting role. Maybe Kate Beckinsale could have done a better job. Dwayne Johnson has came along way since he first started acting. He was actually good. Which might not have been a surprise to some but it was to me.I recommend it. It was the most fun i have had at a cinema in a long time and it was very funny. Go see it now.8/10,Get Smart
147,jemps918,a pleasant surprise,7,25 June 2008,"Get Smart was a pleasant surprise in a number of ways. Wasn't thrilled by the trailer and wasn't that eager to see it, and while it wasn't of the I'm-laughing-so-hard-I-can't-breathe variety, the comic timing of everyone involved was commendable.It's refreshing to see Steve Carell take on a character that you think is trite but then still manages to make you laugh. The way his character Maxwell Smart rises from his foibles is thankfully different from the other usual clueless hyperboles.Anne Hathaway finally breaks away from her makeover-fave pigeonhole as Maxwell's uber-hot and competitive partner Agent 99. I say finally because her terrible turn in Brokeback Mountain felt forced and contrived, so unlike her praiseworthy performance in Get Smart where her beauty does not distract, but instead enhances her femme fatale character. She does not overact but instead delivers her lines and facial expressions subtly enough to be credible.Even the rest of the supporting cast turn in laudable performances. Interesting bonus: the unexpectedly unbelievable action sequences.",Get Smart
148,pinkliz41,Not the best from Carell but nonetheless entertaining.,6,25 August 2008,"Get Smart is a T.V. adaption of the same name by Mel Brooks and is considered one of the best of its type. The film though contains many laughs and some thrills but lacks on character study and story. Its by far not Carells best nor Hathaways being the supporting actress. The characters seem in some scenes corny, but in others they seem alright. The story is a bit bleak and uninvented and the director could of easily thought of a better one with more excitement and a better tempo. Despite this being said, Ge Smart delivers comedy that in places is so funny and unbearable that you would think its Carells best. But then at other times the comedy lacks its substance, gains in repetitiveness and feels childish as well.Overall not the best, but there's definitely enough for a possible sequel with more action, funny comedy and a more experienced director.",Get Smart
149,Ric-7,Not Very Funny,4,26 June 2008,"I saw the film in a theatre, and not at home. I went with modest expectations. I was disappointed.As much as I wished to laugh and enjoy the film, it was just NOT FUNNY. It is difficult to say why. I cannot fault the actors, who all did an excellent job in replicating the originals. But perhaps an early indication of problems was that the gifted comic genius Alan Arkin elicited only smiles, and not uncontrollable laughter.The Rock doing a parody of his usual tough guy roles--he was just fine, but it was just not funny. Bill Murray as an agent in a tree--not nearly as funny as it should have been. What a colossal waste of talent! I think the problems are attributable to the script and the direction. I don't want to unduly blame anyone. I don't have a ""black box"" to retrieve to tell me the cause of this disaster.It's not unendurable. It's a mild, pleasant film.

I don't know what the hell is up with the negative reviews and all, I for one haven't seen the original TV series so I can't compare the two but does it really deserve the beating its been getting? If you're looking for ""witty"" or ""smart"" humor, then go watch Juno or something because you won't find it here. This film is a laugh-out-loud treat with a little touch of slapstick humor here and there, I'd say this film is helluva funny. Steve Carell's comedic prowess is amazing, almost every scene with him is hilarious. Almost all the good lines went to him and he delivered it really well. The film couldn't have worked if Steve Carell isn't in the titular role. You know, if its Will Ferrell or some other funny guy out there, it wouldn't honestly work. There's this thing about Steve Carell that makes him an absolute shoe-in for the role of Maxwell Smart. Will Ferrell is so used at playing hairy, idiotic, dumb characters so I think the film would be a disaster if he played Maxwell Smart. Not that I have anything against him but Steve Carell is just the perfect man for the job.Dwayne Johnson (we must call him that way now), Alan Arkin, Anne Hathaway, Terence Stamp and those two nerd geeks were a nice addition to the cast but honestly speaking, this film is Steve Carell all the way. Its the Steve Carell Movie and its everything you've been hoping for in a comedy flick.8/10",Get Smart
152,moutonbear25,Get Smart Already!,6,21 June 2008,"Maxwell Smart is the kind of guy who can see the big picture. His mammoth 600+ page reports demonstrate his great attention to detail; the post-it notes he leaves for himself throughout his home show his dedication to living an orderly existence; and though he has little skill in social scenarios, his big heart gives him solid insight into where those around him are coming from. Max, as he is known to most, is also ambitious. In the last few years, he has gone from dramatically overweight fact checker to fit potential secret agent at supposedly defunct undercover spy agency, CONTROL. Yet still, he carries himself as though he were invisible. All of this makes Steve Carrell the perfect man to play the television icon in the first film incarnation of GET SMART. His humble likability is always endearing and his dry delivery is as sharp as ever but even his dumbfounded obliviousness is not enough to save GET SMART from its trite pandering to the masses.Essentially, GET SMART could have been a lot smarter. It also could have used a little more effort and originality. The irony of the Maxwell Smart character is that he really is a bright guy. He is both book smart and emotionally intelligent. He possesses attributes that give him the potential to be an amazing agent but his smarts rarely make it past his clumsy, awkward exterior, leaving the impression on most around him that he is basically useless. And though parts of this duality are present in Carrell's performance, veteran television writing team, Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember, rely on some very simple conventions to guarantee laughs. We've got jokes about carb consumption and presidents who read to schoolchildren when there are more important matters to attend to. There are intimidating giants that are really sensitive souls and overweight women who show off the dance moves they never get to seeing as how no one ever asks them to dance. As if that weren't enough fuel for formulaic fun, we've even got The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) walking into walls while flashing us his toothy greatness.As simple as the whole story is, director Peter Segal puts so little effort into telling it that it's often easy to forget that a story is actually happening. Pieced together, it goes a little something like CONTROL has been compromised and brand new agent, Max and his freshly reconstructed partner, Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway), must infiltrate arch nemesis bad guy group, KAOS, as they are the only agents left who could do so without being recognized. KAOS intends to blow up the world if they don't get an obscene amount of money and CONTROL seems to be the only group that believes they exist. So Max and 99 gallivant through Moscow to ensure the world remains safely intact. Something funny and exciting happens to them over here and then something more or less amusing happens to them over there. Still, though the action does not always tie together well enough to avoid disorientation, Carrell and Hathaway's scenes are always welcome considering their quick and infectious chemistry. It is exciting to see Hathaway keep up with Carrell and the film moves so much faster when they're on screen together compared with when Segal subjects us to a handful of supporting players (excluding Johnson and Alan Arkin, who is delightful as the chief) whose scenes stall the pace and kill the laughs.When Carrell is awkward and uncomfortable, the results are hilarious. When the movie he's in tries to mirror that same delicately achieved vibe, it is just sloppy and unwieldy. Sadly, he ends up in these movies far more often than he should. GET SMART comes together entirely on Carrell's shoulders with no help whatsoever from the people who are supposed to be steering the whole thing. And while he keeps the laughs coming as hard as he can, even Steve can only do so much. In order for GET SMART to have filled out the spots Carrell couldn't reach, it should have heeded the advice that was right there all along in the title itself.",Get Smart

Some of the scenes were clever, others, down right silly and not very funny. The location shots of Moscow with Red Square lit up at night and along the Volga, were really beautiful, as well as the inland shots of the forest area of Russia. Here the film was very interesting. However, as the film reaches a climax in Los Angeles, GET SMART becomes just another action film shot in downtown L.A., and the international intrigue from the Russian scenes is unfortunately forgotten. Then GET SMART becomes GET SILLY. But, Alan Arkin, like his wonderful performance in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, is very strong in the movie,and drives the film forward.",Get Smart

Not since 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles', the 'Naked Gun' series and 'Dumb and Dumber' have I laughed so hard. I can appreciate warm, humorous comedy too, but silly, what some people call ""dumb humor"" really makes me laugh. In Get Smart I found the dialog mostly hysterically funny, the slapstick equally as funny and the story and performances absolutely perfect. Steve Carrel is one of the funniest humans on the planet Earth and put a great new spin on the character ""Maxwell Smart."" Alan Arkin has always been superbly adept at comedy as well as drama and makes a great ""Chief."" Ann Hathaway adds beauty, sophistication and intelligence to the ""Agent 99"" character. The supporting players also add much to the fun. For those who hated it, I'd suggest having your senses of humor examined and maybe watching it again with out extremely high expectations which ruin a lot of first viewings of films.

Eventually, it froze again, but miraculously started working and finally finished?

This isn't really doing anything too original, and it is a remake of a classic TV show, but the humor is fresh and funny as all get out, the characters interesting, if not a bit generic (but it IS a satire of sorts), and it's all given a nice fast pace to boot.

2) It is utterly unbelievable that Anne Hathaway would fall for Steve Carell
3) There's a really bizarre line where Terence Stamp sarcastically says he'll miss all the dead actors because he'll miss their political views

158,imbluzclooby,Missed it by that much!,7,22 June 2008,"I was a huge fan of the TV series from the 60's that starred Don Adams and Barbara Feldon in the lead roles. The comedy worked great as a 30-minute sitcom. I must say that I wasn't disappointed in this feature length version. All the usual antics are displayed in humorous tribute here with Max walking down Control's corridor of opening and closing doors to the snappy one-liners that made Agent 86 such a card. Steve Carrell reprises the famed role of Agent 86 (Maxwell Smart) along with Anne Hathaway as Agent 99.I thought Carrell was adequate, but he seemed to lack the subtle mannerisms and expressions that Don Adams had. I must admit that my expectations were to see a Don Adams clone, but maybe that's unfair. Anne Hathaway is great and I thought the Rock was terrific as the cocky Agent 23. Alan Arkin steps in as the Chief and has a couple of good moments.I think this was worth my $7.25 matinée fee. This should be a fun comedy for fans that remember the TV series and for others who are unfamiliar with it.Be sure to catch the robot character 'Hymie' in the end. You know there will have to be a sequel to this.",Get Smart
159,joestank15,"Fun. Nothing more, occasionally a little less.",7,9 November 2008,"Get Smart - Based off the TV series, of which I know nothing, Maxwell Smart (Steve Carell) is promoted to Agent status after nearly every other agent is killed. It's more or less the same story as Johnny English and countless other spy spoofs, and the fact that Get Smart is based on its TV series makes little difference to that fact.Homage or not, it also homages a little from Moonraker, the one James Bond I thought there was nothing to glean from. I'm sorry, but the parachuting sequence near the start of the movie was a bad idea. It's too much, even for a spoof, and especially for one that tries later to legitimize itself. It borders on Indiana surviving the nuclear bomb. The film doesn't know whether it's serious or not, and picks odd moments to do so and not to. I'm gonna blame that on the director and writers.What this film has, that other spy spoofs do not, is Steve Carell. He shows a happy blend of competence and incompetence to suspend your disbelief. He's also very funny and watchable. Unless for some reason a Get Smart 2 is made, for which there is no reason, this is the only time Carell will appear in an action sequence. Speaking of which, the action is pretty cool. I had to rewind a few times. Anne Hathaway is a nice spunky addition. It's nice to have her playing a 'beautiful' character now, after so many movies where we are told how fat and unattractive she is. They have good chemistry, though the romantic sideplot felt tacked on.My favorite in the film though, has to be Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. I knew The Rock could act (The Rundown isn't a terrible film, and Doom wasn't a sh*tfest because of Dwayne), but I didn't know he could be funny. And no, I'll never watch the abomination with him and the little girl. God, he was wasted on wrestling all these years. Alan Arkin is also quite funny as The Chief (the sequence at the golf-course had me roaring). Bill Murray has a surprising and hilarious cameo as lonely Agent 13. And I love Masi Oka. Just in general, but he's in this film too. Everyone seemed to be having so much fun making this movie and it often shows on screen.One slight against the film is the toothless performance of Terrence Stamp as the baddie. He just phones it in these days, doesn't he? Chalk it to old age, I guess. Bow to Zod? I might nod my head in his general direction.So, when all is said, we have a not bad film homage to an old TV show, thanks largely to strong performances from its leads. That was more than I, (and, I'll imagine, everyone else) was expecting. Get Smart gets a B.",Get Smart
160,Bravesfan17,"Not bad, lots of fun",7,22 May 2010,"Director Peter Segal's version of Get Smart is not as bad as many people make it out be. Steve Carell put his own touch on the character of Maxwell Smart. At times Maxwell Smart does seem like a dumbed down version of Andy Stitzer (Carell's character from The 40-Year-Old Virgin) or Michael Scott (Carell's character from The Office), but that is how Carell works this role. Anne Hathaway does a good job as Smart's female counterpart Agent 99. She is tougher and smarter side of Smart. Alan Arkin and Dwayne Johnson do fine jobs in their roles but are not given a whole lot to do. Segal does a passable job of mixing the action and the comedy, and it works. You'll get some laughs out of it and it is a fun movie to watch.",Get Smart
161,noizyme,Pretty good action movie with awkward comedy,6,26 December 2008,"Almost like a cross between Austin Powers and The Spy Who Loved Me, Get Smart resurrects random TV show nostalgia with the movie adaptation of the series Get Smart. Maxwell Smart (played by Steve Carell) is a bumbling secret agent who is paired up with Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway) to stop a nuclear scheme by an evil spy group, headed by none other than Terence Stamp's character Seigfried.The movie was OK. It had a number of gags and puns to fill the story out with light-hearted humor. The music was a typical fare of action films, but well done, though. Carell's acting is mostly coming from watching The Mask (with Jim Carrey) a little too much, I think. Hathaway plays an awkward partner whose chemistry with Carell seems a little at-arms-length through the whole movie, so their ""love story"" seems a little misplaced.There were a ton of cameos that whiz past you: Bill Murray, Kevin Nealon, James Caan, Patrick Warburton, Ryan Seacrest, The Great Khali (of professional wrestling fame), Larry Miller, and Cedric Yarbrough all make their way around the more prominent characters. I thought Dwayne Johnson (aka The Rock) did a pretty good job with his delivery, and he had some good scenes.But despite all those good points, you really get frustrated over the all-important question: what does Get Smart have anything to do with all of this? I get it, the shoe phone and gadgets, but in actuality, this is just another Steve Carell vehicle where he gets to play himself...but what if the 40-year-old Virgin goes sky diving? Or is a bumbling mess while trying to get past a high-intensity laser-field? It all gets very monotonous and dull. The gags wear out after a while and that's when the director tries to shock the crowd with a kiss between The Rock and Carell...oh no. Alan Arkin was in this, too, but should the chief of such an operation really be over-emotional and bumbling as much as the most novice agent you have on your team? In conclusion, if you have 2 hours to kill (2 hours even?), it might be worth it if you're a Steve Carell connoisseur, but you'll quickly see why ""fat jokes"" and awkward communication between you and your enemies will do nothing for your loss of those couple of hours.

163,Craig_McPherson,"Missed it by that much - in this case, a mile",3,21 June 2008,"Seldom has a movie had so many good things going for it and failed so miserably, yet such is the case with Get Smart, the latest in a long line of television chestnuts finding a home on the big screen thanks to the utter dearth of imagination in Hollywood these days.Its problem lies with not knowing what it wants to be  family comedy or action flick, with the end result being a weak-kneed attempt at both (although to be fair, the action comes off better than the laughs). It's too bad because it sports a smart, likable cast with Steve Carell in the role of Maxwell Smart, and the easy on the eyes Anne Hathaway as his partner and love interest, Agent 99. They're complimented by Alan Arkin who gets substantial screen time as CONTROL's beleaguered Chief, Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson as the muscle-bound Agent 23, and Terence Stamp as KAOS' evil mastermind Siegfried. Even the film's small, almost filler roles and cameos are peppered with the likes of Masi Oka (Hiro from Heroes), James Caan, Bill Murray, and Patrick Warburton (Seinfeld's Puddy, The Tick).The movie's problem isn't with its actors, but rather the script they're given to work with. Director Peter Segal along with writers Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember seem bereft of any sort of creative vision, at times appearing content to mine big budget action, only to reign it in with gags and scenes that may have been funny on paper, but fall flat on screen.To their credit, Carell, Hathaway and Arkin all steer clear of trying to portray letter-perfect clones of the TV show's characters. Instead, Carell's Smart is a bookish dweeb who is smarter than he appears, while Hathaway's 99 is a crack female agent trying to break the glass ceiling of a male-dominated espionage agency. Stamp's Siegfried, however, is the film's most glaring example of a talented actor gone to waste coupled with the most wildly divergent character from the Mel Brooks  Buck Henry inspired original. Whereas in the show Siegfried, as portrayed by Bernie Kopell, milked the character for every drop of its pseudo-Nazi comedic undertones, both Stamp and the script play it straight, as the film's cardboard villain.Given the promise of the cast, one can only hope that with a change of director and writers, there may be hope for the inevitable sequel. In the meantime, save your money and wait for this one to hit the DVD racks.",Get Smart
164,toqtaqiya2,A charming and consistently funny summer comedy.,6,2 October 2012,"Get Smart is a spy-fi comedy that delivers on all fronts. The acting is universally good. Steve Carell plays it straight as the often incompetent but sometimes amazing Agent 86. This comedy is mostly about talk humor and Carell is very good at this. The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005) made Carell famous but Little Miss Sunshine (2006) and Get Smart confirmed his talents as a comedian. The supporting cast includes Anne Hathaway, Dwayne Johnson and Alan Arkin. The film was released just before Hathaway became very famous. She's very talented, no question about it. She's an excellent actress but the good part is that she's a good comedian, and she proved this several times. It seems that she's best at physical comedy. In this film Hathaway as Agent 99 again showed that she's a very attractive screen presence. Johnson does good work as Agent 23. He's funny and likable here, so I will mention that I liked him in just about every film he's been in. Alan Arkin is perfect as The Chief, playing a more serious and fatherly character. The film's plot is of no great importance but the humor is consistent. In fact, this is the most enjoyable American comedy since Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005). Peter Segal's direction is suitable while Dean Semler's cinematography is a definite standout. It's obvious that a good deal of money ($80 million) was spent on making the film, so the action scenes are exciting as well. Get Smart is easily worth recommending. It's not an Oscar contender but it did what it set out to do very well.",Get Smart

One thing that I was disappointed about was that Max was a stupid in the series. I mean he was successful at his missions only but sheer luck, and with the help of 99. In this movie he is bumbling but not stupid. He does succeed on his own and yes sometimes with the help of 99 but I think they took something special away when they made him smart. Also the series had uses of a lot of funny gadgets, like his silly shoe phone. I think they could have used them more here, but that is my opinion.

Well I am now very pleased I was, because this incredibly hilarious non-stop action thrill-ride absolutely blew me away. The combination splendid humour, – both the intelligent, subtle and wacky, obvious kinds – intense, edge-of-your seat action and the serious issue of terrorism makes for a most enjoyable trip to the cinema.Familiar star of comedies such as 'Evan Almighty' and 'Dan in Real Life' Steve Carell and rising young Hollywood star Anne Hathaway star as two agents of the bad-guy battling organisation CONTROL that reluctantly pair up on a mission to save the world from the evil spy force KAOS. The plot I hear is perfectly true to the old '60s episodes so there is no need for explanation. But before I close this review of must comment on the stunning performances of this dynamic duo: Carell is wonderfully charismatic and of course extremely funny, even when he has not been given a purposefully comedic line to say there is something about his nature that makes you want to crack up; and Hathaway brings all her talent to this role and lights up her scenes with an astonishing energy. These were definitely the best pieces of acting to be seen here. Though of course the other cast members that include Dwayne Johnson, Alan Arkin and Terence Stamp were quite good as well; but those two really stole the show.Though this film is filled with many clichés. Some of them are fun and acceptable, but a few really weigh things down, this is the only reason why I have given the movie a 9 instead of a 10.",Get Smart

171,colonel_green,A TV adaptation done right.,8,29 June 2008,"The last few years have not been especially kind to the studio comedy, but there have been the occasional lights, a few of which featured Steve Carell (such as the hilarious ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin""), an excellent comedian who got his start smartly playing dumb on ""The Daily Show""). Of all the types of comedy, one of the most hard-done-by is the adaptation of a popular television show. There have only been a couple of decent ones, and ""Get Smart"" is easily the most successful such film that I've seen yet. I was not a fan of the original show (well before my time), so I entered the theatre neither burdened by nostalgia or expectations that might slant my judgement in either direction.Steve Carell is Maxwell Smart, an analyst for CONTROL, a secret government agency that concerns itself more or less entirely with fighting KAOS, a sinister, ideologically-vague organization that dates from the Cold War. He has always wanted to be a field agent, and is applying for the eight time (being obese scuppered his previous bids); this time, he has it all together. The Chief (Alan Arkin, in a lovely supporting role) doesn't want to lose his best analyst, but, when KAOS learns the identity of all CONTROL field agents, he has no choice but to put Smart on the case, in the company of the sexy Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway, a long way from ""The Princess Diaries"" and ""The Devil Wears Prada""); the two travel to Moscow. Also on hand at CONTROL are Agent 23 (Dwayne Johnson, aka, The Rock, soon to be Black Adam in director Peter Segal's ""Billy Batson and the Legend of Shazam""), the #1 agent who is actually rather nice to Max; Agent Larabee (David Koechner) and Agent 91 (Terry Crews), who fill the jerk roles; and Masi Oka and Nate Torrence as Max's analyst friends. The face of KAOS is Siegfried, played by Terrence Stamp (who doesn't appear to have been told he's in a comedy), with assistants Shtarker (Ken Davitian) and Dalip (Dalip Singh).""Get Smart"" is clearly comedic, but what sets it apart from, say, ""Austin Powers"", is the level of verisimilitude it employs in its satire of the spy genre. A single gander at one of the ""Austin Powers"" films would be enough to mark it as a comedy, but ""Get Smart"" is the sort of parody that strives to closely emulate the look of the genre; in this case, spy films. There is minimal difference between the look of this movie and ""Alias"" or ""The Bourne Identity"". There are some genuinely terrific action scenes, with all involved acquitting themselves well, even Carell, though there's a comedic slant to everything he does; Hathaway is particularly plausible as an action girl.Overall, it is a very well-made, entertaining comedy.",Get Smart
172,loufalce,Get REAL Smart-Don't Waste Good Money on This Drivel,1,4 July 2008,"Yet another TV show becomes a movie. Steve {The Office} Carell plays dimwitted agent Maxwell Smart in a movie that's so bad, it makes the worst movie you ever saw become the second worst movie you ever saw. The seventh rate story- if you can call it that has a megalomaniac trying to take over the world. It is so unfunny, it is absolutely pathetic. About the only thing Anne Hathaway does as agent 99 is look good-she seems incapable of doing anything else. Bill Murray has the fine sense to limit his screen time to about 90 seconds, and a few faces from the TV series turn up in very small roles. Movie is supposed to be part thriller and part action film. It is neither. Even though I really was not a fan of the TV series, at least it was light years ahead of this piece of -hit. All this does is drag it through the dirt and cheapen whatever good memories we had of it. Thank God Don Adams is not here to see it. Keep it up Hollywood! Keep making crappy movies like this and keep sendin 'em to the multiplexes on a weekly basis. No wonder the film industry is going down the tubes.

173,robertallenandersonjr,This will be the best comedy movie of the year,10,20 June 2008,Get Smart was the funniest movie this year so far. I have seen a lot of funny movies this year but this was the funniest. This movie just keeps getting funnier and funnier as it goes on. It kind of started out slow but then picked up a lot. I think that this will be easily an instant classic. Most adults will really love this movie because they grew up with the TV show. I think mostly any ages can enjoy it as well. The action was very funny and faun to watch. They mixed it all in very well. The acting was great between every one. The whole cast did an amazing job. I think this is probably Steve Carrels best movie yet. He made this movie so much funnier than it was. I love how he can just make you laugh with his face expressions. Anne Hathway was great as well and added a ton of laughs. The movie was just a perfect length not to long not to short. It was well worth your money and time to go see. I think you should definitely give this movie a chance and go see it. So all and all just give this movie a chance and go see it. The movie might start out slow but just give it time to pick up.

175,simonparker1990,Smarter than I expected,6,21 August 2008,"A few years ago a similar spy comedy arrived in the form of Johnny English. I remember getting stupidly excited about Johnny English, not only do I love Rowan Atkinson's work, I love spy movies, and I generally love spy spoofs. However what I also remember as I watched that movie was just how disappointed I was by it. While it was funny at times it was puerile, it was boring and it sadly wasn't half the movie it could have been. Now when I saw the trailers for Get Smart unfortunately I was bracing myself for another Johnny English. I've never seen the television series, but all I kept seeing was an American version of Johnny English, only with Steve Carell (whose work I also love). So what a great surprise it is to say I really enjoyed Get Smart, probably more than I really should have done as it is puerile at times as well. But its also genuinely funny, Steve Carell does a great job, the cast are hilarious, and there are also some pretty decent action sequences in there as well. Admiteddly, much like Zohan, Get Smart is a bit too long for its own good, and there are some jokes that fall flat. Still this is a comedy well worth seeing, and definitely one of the more successful comedies in recent years. Oh and of course its worth seeing for Alan Arkin diving at a man in a meeting, priceless.Performance wise this delivers really well. Steve Carell delivers a very good performances here, most namely because he plays it mostly straight. Sure he does his usual shouting bit here and there, but generally he plays a pretty straight role, hell Maxwell Smart is a lot more intelligent than I ever expected him to be. To be fair that's part of the joy in the movie, Smart is not a complete idiot, he's sometimes a bit foolish, and he's not the best spy in the world, but he does have his moments. Ann Hathaway delivers yet another established comedy performance, showing that she has come a long way since The Princess Diaries. She has great chemistry with Carell and the pair have great moments. Alan Arkin steals most of the movie as the Chief of Control. While he isn't in it for a lot of the time, the scenes he does have are great. And he also gets involved in the action towards the end! Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson once again shows he does have a pretty good sense of humour. The staple moment from the trailer being just as funny in the film. Terence Stamp is a hilarious villain and his line about snoring while awake made me laugh the most in the movie. And I haven't even begun to talk about Bill Murray in a tree, actually not as funny as it sounds really.Comedy wise Get Smart has both moments of brilliance, and moments that don't work as well. Steve Carell's shouting in ""the cone of silence"" not being half as funny as apparently the rest of the cinema thought it was, and Terence Stamp's dry one liners, and a priceless meeting being definitely the best moments of the film. Yet the biggest surprise is that as an action film it does hold up quite well. The final scenes in Los Angeles actually being almost edge of your seat stuff, and a mi-air fight (which is a complete rip-off of Moonraker I have to add) being quite well made and funny at the same time. Still the movie isn't always perfect. By the time the movie is finally drawing to a close you do feel as if you've spent to long with Smart. The final gag as well really is a pretty limp way to send the film off. Still Get Smart is an enjoyable way to spend an afternoon, and the great theme tune will be stuck in your head for hours.Overall Get Smart is a good, fun movie, that while flawed is still well worth watching. A lot better than Johnny English, and up there with the best of Austin Powers, its funny, well written and has a great cast.",Get Smart

177,walsh-22,Laughs and action all the way,10,15 July 2009,"This is the first film that if I had the time I would have gone to the cinema again, it was that good.It was the first spy film from the U.S. where I wasn't sneering at it thinking it was another rip-off of Bond. When I went to see the film, I had no idea it had been based on a TV show in the 60's.Maxwell Smart in this movie is not your typical spy/hero, he is a lot older, not classically handsome and he is very bumbling but that's why I like him. He is so different from the other heroes that he is a long needed breath of fresh air, he is brilliantly played by the very funny and talented Steve Carrell.The cast are just as wonderful and I really couldn't imagine any other actors playing the roles other than the ones cast in the movie. Anne Hathaway (Agent 99) plays a really kick ass agent who starts off very hard and we see a more tender side to her when she spends time with Max. Dwayne Johnson (Agent 23), I really loved his scenes particularly the one where he stapled a sheet of paper to another agent's head and the other showing him destroying an agent's cell phone in a conference. Did not see it coming that he would turn out to be the villain. Alan Arkin as the Chief was just as hilarious especially when he tackled the Vice-president to the floor and then hitting another agent in the face when he called him Grandpa. Terrance Stamp (Siegfried) was very dry and witty as a villain for KAOS and I have to mention the other actors that had smaller parts but still managed to be unforgettable in the film like Bruce (Masi Oka) and Lloyd (Nate Torrence), the Q's of Get Smart and Larabee (David Koechner) and Agent 91 (Terry Crews).There was so many funny scenes that had me in fits of laughter throughout the film and I really enjoyed the action sequences.

And I'm glad Carell and Hathaway are 86 and 99 because together they're a superb combo. I hope they're making a sequel that holds up the quality level. If yes, I'll be there opening day to see it. So many super hero films have come out recently that it's created a sucking void for the chances to market them very well. Most aren't that great and a goofy flick like this has more comedy in it than most action films can shake a stick at. If anyone should play the lead in ""Wonder Woman"", it's clearly Hathaway. I think her portraying Judy Garland is not a good idea, as Garland was a tiny, fragile person and Anne is capable of kicking much ass, as she demonstrates here to impressive effect. Why play an icon who has been portrayed already (by Judy Davis, brilliantly)?Steve Carell makes you forget the ignoramus he rules the roost as on ""The Office"" with his not quite in control agent man.

This is not your typical screwball comedy that ends up falling flat on its face like the Pink Panther and all the others. This is original and witty. The casting is perfect. Steve Carrell as Maxwell Smart! Perfection! Anne Hathaway as Agent 99, Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson as Agent 23 and Alan Arkin as the Chief! Yes! Yes! Yes! Terrence Stamp is amusing as the main villain Seigfried. Another good thing is they never run out of jokes. In these sort of movies they usually run out of good ideas after the first half hour. This maintains a high standard through out the film and other films of its kind should take note. It is an excellent spoof of more serious spy films most notably the Bond films.",Get Smart

It had a great action finale -- in fact, the last 1/3 or so of the film was the best overall. This includes some nice humorous touches that one only wished was more evident earlier on.But, the movie doesn't work as a whole. The problem is really its middle. It starts off pleasant enough, though having Max as an expert at anything (he is a skilled analyst) seems a bit wrong to a fan of the series. Then, it gets tedious. Not much humor. Siegfried (nice to see Bernie Kopell is still around / here in a cameo) is too serious. The dance seq. was amusing, but overall, pretty lame. The airplane scene? The scenes at the party as a whole? Didn't work for me.And, what is with Max suddenly being an expert with guns? He even at least one pt leads(!) 99 on a chase. This is, to be blunt, stupid. Actually, I didn't quite like how 99 was written. Anne Hathaway is a great choice and does a good job. But, 99 comes off as a bit of an idiot at times, Max ultimately being the most level-headed one (she doesn't come of having great judgment romantically either)! I was bored really until the last third. It saved the film, but not enough to really make it good as a whole. So, for some good parts and a great finale, the average is around 6 for me.",Get Smart
184,hung_fao_tweeze,Lighten Up and Enjoy The Ride,7,23 October 2009,"Those of us who did live through the original Get Smart TV series have fond memories of show with attached laugh track to help you know what's funny. Unlike some shows though, the TV show was occasionally very funny and at worst just plain silly. Well, there's no laugh track here. Steve Carrell is NOT Don Adams either. So, I began to watch this recalling the disaster that was the 'Avengers' movie. In this case my first viewing was disorienting at first. Soon I was able to relax and the movie actually began to get rather amusing and downright hilarious quite a few times. After I was through I wasn't unhappy with what I saw. In fact, I kept thinking about it afterward and soon developed a desire to see it again. My second viewing was more enjoyable since I knew what to expect. I laughed much more once I got over being nostalgic for Don Adams. Carrell does a good job and may very well be the most naturally funny man on TV today. He works well here too. There are other character changes that take some getting used to. But they aren't too hard to get around. It's basically entertaining and I look forward to a 'Get Smart 2' should this be in the future.",Get Smart

186,edwbur,be smart and see this movie,10,27 January 2011,"this movie is no doubt one of the funniest Steve carell movies ever. it was hilarious. it brought in the beautiful Anne Hathaway, the tough Dwayne Johnson, the funny old timer Alan arkin, and of course the funniest Steve carell. i thought it was a good idea to have Dwayne Johnson and a funny and tough man. in his recent comedy movies he wasn't very tough and if he was the producers didn't show it much, except for race to witch mountain he new that martial arts stuff. but thats the closest they got. also one of the things i worried about for this movie was that Steve carell performance would replicate the old maxwell smart. be exactly the same. mo one can copy that. and good thing they didn't. in fact they made maxwell smart annoyingly funny. in fact this is most likely Steve carells funniest performance next to date night and the 40 year old virgin. the funniest scene in my opinion was when agent 99 and maxwell smart were on the plane and they needed to land early for there mission. Maxwell went to the bathroom for the parachute behind the mirror. to get out of some sort of cuffs. he used his swiss knife which had a arrow in it to get the wire off. he kept missing ndit hit his ear, through his nose, behind his neck, in the back of the leg, on the cheek and then it hit the emergency deploy to get out of the airplane from the bathroom and he fell out of the plane and you'll have to see the movie to find out if he is alive or not. but you probably know the answer. most definitely see this movie.",Get Smart
187,jake-179,They missed it by THAT MUCH!,1,7 July 2008,"This movie sucked. The problem was not with the cast. I think the cast was great, lots of good talent, lots of great acting. But the script was TERRIBLE! It seemed to be mostly just a frame work in which Steve Carrell could do his improv. And that is what he does best, but it just didn't work here. The script was hard to follow, the story was non-sensical, and scenes were random and lacked direction. Also, much of the action was extremely contrived and poorly thought out. It was a good effort, but as Max says, they missed it by THAT MUCH! I am shocked to see how many glowing reviews there are for this stinker here on the IMDb. Obviously, the movie producers are getting people to write lots of positive reviews on their movies and fill up the entries on the IMDb. If you read the positive reviews and compare them to the negative reviews, it is pretty clear which ones are genuine reviews from normal users.This movie was full of problems and jokes that just didn't work. I loved Steve Carrell in Anchor Man, and I like his comedy and style. But I will tell you that I never once laughed while I was watching this movie. Yes, I had a couple of light moments, a couple of chuckles, but no real laughs. Nothing that struck me at all.Spoiler Alert! One ridiculous scene was when Max had his hands binded on the airplane and he goes to the bathroom to try to escape. He uses his special Swiss Army knife...but instead of just using THE BLADE OF THE KNIFE, he tries to SHOOT the binding with his miniature crossbow. And as the crossbow miss-fires and shoots little arrows into him over and over again (almost putting out his EYE), Max doesn't give up or try the blade instead...no, he just keeps shooting himself with the crossbow. What was he really expecting to do with that crossbow? It seemed to be THE WORST option on the knife to try to remove the bindings. It just made absolutely no sense.That is a good example of the typical circumstances in the scenes that made up this movie. They were ridiculous, poorly thought out, poorly motivated, and made of pure nonsense. And that was truly distracting.As I said, this movie was a big let-down, and I recommend you avoid it. A note to the IMDb: You should do something about these phony reviews that people are leaving. It degrades the authenticity of the site.",Get Smart

Acting is a plus, with good performances from the star studded cast. The intelligent mixing of comedy and espionage works well to the greatness of Carell's antics and Hathaway's ability to simultaneously play serious and sarcastic. Character development is nicely progressed, therefore, with a better than expected emotional depth to the story. The plot is somewhat simple and slightly too convenient, but a solid conclusion gives the film credibility. Overall, a worth watching film.",Get Smart

190,Red_Flag,It isn't funny and it certainly isn't clever.,1,7 September 2008,"It hurts trying to write a negative review for a film I wanted to love. It's should work the cast is great, their characters, brilliant and for 10 minutes or so I am really getting into ""Get Smart"". But then I remember the Mel brooks produced rat's ass of a show that this garbage is based on and think to myself. No way can they adapt this. And as much as I hate to admit it, my prediction was absolutely correct. Here we have Steve Carrel and Anna Hathaway both wasted in their roles as double agents take down kayos, their arch rivals. That said there really isn't much of a plot here, its sticks to what the show does ""best"" a minor build up for a poor excuse for slapstick. ""You make Control look like a laughing stock"" bawls Alan Arkin's character. If only! But unfortunately for its audience (who looks similarly un-amused) the film short-changes the on a unspeakable scale. It's clear director Peter Segal spent his money on the special effect driven climax and had no money to pay some decent writers. The jokes are far and few Between and when they do appear the reaction given is mainly a snigger. I didn't want to hate this movie. It probably deserves one star, but simply because of how disappointed I was. It gets a turkey.40-Year-Old Virgin star Steve Carrel steps into the telephonic shoes of television's most beloved bumbling detective in this big-screen adaptation of the hit 1960s-era comedy series created by Mel Brooks. The evil geniuses at KAOS have hatched a diabolical plot to dominate every living man, woman, and child on the planet, and their plot gets under way as they attack the headquarters of the U.S. spy agency Control. As a result of the attack, the identity of every agent working for Control has been compromised. Realizing that the only way to thwart KAOS' evil plan is to promote eager but inexperienced Control analyst Maxwell Smart (Carell) to the rank of special agent, the Chief (Alan Arkin) reluctantly teams Smart with Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway) -- a veteran super-spy whose beauty is only surpassed by her lethality.But ""Get Smarts"" major flaws is in its ambition. Its sets its sights low and only appeals to thoses who found its originator hilarious. Making Max Smart an Incompetent but lovable character makes him generic 40 year old virgin Maxwell Smart. We've seen this done before, we've seen it done much better. This is merely a look of what could have been. Its hard laughs never escalate above a giggle and the charm and character that resonates disappears once you realise that you simple cannot connect with these people. The most likable character in the film turns out to be the lead villain. And when you villains the most likable character you know you've done something wrong.VERDCIT: It pains me to dislike this film, there's moments in which I want to love it, but it's not enough to redeem the lazy inept wrighting and its compromise of effects and script. Anybody looking for some laugh out loud moments should look elsewhere.",Get Smart
191,Phillemos,"Funny, but not as funny as the TV show. Steve Carell carries this film on his shoulders",7,14 July 2008,"The movie is funny. However, it's not foot-stomping, roll-around-the-floor funny like the '60s TV series was. If it weren't for Steve Carell (who is perfectly cast as Maxwell Smart), this would be a pretty mediocre movie. Steve Carell's style more closely resembles Don Adams than any other actor/comedian currently out there. He does a great job at parroting the typical Maxwell Smart-ism's (i.e., ""missed it by THAT much""; ""would you believe?...""). And the whole ""well neither one of us is dead so obviously I'm not CONTROL"" line is priceless. What ultimately drops this film down, however, is the film thumbing its nose at ""Get Smart"" canon. For example, 86 and 99 aren't married (though with what Anne Hathway has been through lately with boyfriends under FBI suspicion of multi-million dollar fraud, I can't blame 99 for being a little commitment-phobic). Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is introduced as a new agent, the blasé 23. In the end he turns out to be a double-agent, which was a nice twist, but why not just lump him in with KAOS from the start. If you appreciate Steve Carell, are a fan of ""The Office"" or ""The 40-year-old Virgin,"" see this movie. If you're an aficionado of the old ""Get Smart"" sitcom, it's worth a look, but you may ultimately be disappointed.",Get Smart

193,jcallows,By far the BEST adaptation of a classic TV series for the big screen.,8,3 December 2007,"I just saw an advance screening of Get Smart and it was great! It was  simply the best adaptation of a classic TV series for the big screen. I  don't know how to explain it but it successfully carried the tone that  the original series had. It was silly but not too silly and, at the  same time, a little serious but not too serious. Familiar characters,  props, music, jokes and lines all brought back fond memories of a  delightful TV series. And there were plenty of new elements in this  film that made it interesting and entertaining to watch.  Steve Carrell was terrific as Agent 86 and seemed to capture the  essence of Maxwell Smart. Not only did his portrayal of him resembled  that of Don Adams' from the sound of Smart's voice to the delivery of  Smart's lines, Carrell managed to inject a bit of his own personality  to create a new Smart that didn't stray too far away from the old.  Anne Hathaway was perfect as Agent 99. She did bear some resemblance to  Barbara Feldon and actually delivered her lines in a similar manner as  her at times. But more importantly, she had great chemistry with  Carrell. A key ingredient to Get Smart's success was Maxwell Smart and  Agent 99's chemistry and I'm glad the writers of this film didn't  forget that. Feldon and Adams had terrific chemistry and so too did  Hathaway and Carrell.   Unlike previous film adaptations of old television series that only  superficially resembled their TV series counterpart, this film can  truly be considered a big screen version of the Get Smart TV series.  Where Lost In Space, Mission Impossible, Charlie's Angels, Starsky and  Hutch and (have I missed anything?) have failed, this film succeeded in  maintaining the tone and style of the original series upon which it's  based. Moreover, the filmmakers managed to bring Get Smart up to date  without forgetting its roots. New ideas created for this film seemed to  be natural extensions of those used for the original series. Jokes,  props, music, characters and plot, old and new, all seemed to be born  from the Get Smart world.  I wish I could get into more details but I don't want to give anything  away. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and highly recommend this to  anyone, especially fans of the original TV series.",Get Smart
194,NavyOrion,Just the right balance of comedy and action,8,20 June 2008,"Yes, go see this movie. I know sometimes a preview looks pretty good and then the movie stinks (hello, Indiana Jones IV?) but this one does not disappoint.I remember enjoying the ""Get Smart"" TV series when I was a kid, and like some other reviewers here, I feared the remake might screw it up (even though watching a couple of 5th-season episodes recently reminded me just how bad the show itself became late in the game.) But this movie version strikes just the right balance of action and comedy, while also balancing fresh ideas with welcome nods to the TV series.After all, it wouldn't be ""Get Smart"" without ""Would you believe..."", ""Sorry about that, Chief"", or ""Missed it by THAT much."" It was also great to see such classics as the shoe phone, the Cone of Silence, Hymie the robot, and not one but two of the cars that Don Adams would have driven. But while some remakes mining the past for material have nothing new to say, and get stuck in paying homage to their predecessors, the ""Get Smart"" movie has a pretty good story of its own. Now this isn't Robert Ludlum material, and I doubt anyone is real surprised to see who turns out to be a bad guy, but it's a lot of fun along the way, with either a sight gag or surprisingly good action (and often both at the same time) coming down the pike every few minutes. There just aren't really any slow spots. I'm sure a lot of funny stuff got left on the cutting room floor (surely they didn't put Carrell in a fat suit for a mere ten seconds of film) but the pacing felt just right. We can catch all that other stuff when the DVD comes out at Christmas.Steve Carrel plays Agent 86 almost exactly the way he portrays Dunder-Mifflin's Michael Scott. He comes off as basically well-meaning and earnest, and although a bit bumbling at times, his Maxwell Smart is thankfully not Don Adam's version. Neither was this one of those ""Naked Gun"" characters who stumbles into success despite his incompetence; Smart has some hilariously bad moments, but is never made out to be simply a lucky fool.Carrell and Anne Hathaway have surprisingly good chemistry, and Alan Arkin is perfect taking over Edward Platt's role as ""the Chief."" Former wrestler Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson does a good job as Agent 23, and an even larger wrestler (7-foot 2-inch, 387-pound Dalip Singh from ""The Longest Yard"") is well-cast as a KAOS underling, although most of the other main bad guys are rather forgettable. Even TV-series KAOS agent Bernie Koppel shows up for a cameo, as does Patrick Warburton (who will be terrific in the inevitable sequel) and Bill Murray (almost unidentifiable hiding in a tree.) Bottom line: you won't come out of this movie feeling as if you were cheated out of your money. Judging from the laughter in the theater and smiles in the lobby as we left, a lot of folks agreed with me. This is going to make a ton of money, and deserves it. Look for ""Get Smart II"" in a couple of years, and let's just hope it is as good as this one. P.S. - It's rated PG-13, but there's very little that's objectionable for even younger viewers (Carrel rips the seat out of his pants.) Take the kids, and have a good time!",Get Smart
195,Len9876,A sad attempt at humor...,1,7 August 2008,"...A sad, and pathetic, attempt at humor. Will Hollywood ever learn that remakes and sequels don't necessarily spell 'success'? The latest news is that Kevin Costner wants to make a sequel of ""The Bodyguard,"" but he does not want to make a remake of ""Dances With Wolves"". While I enjoyed ""The Bodyguard,"" the film would not be the same without Whitney Houston. It would be like a day without a songbird's music, or making a sequel of ""Dances With Wolves"" without the Indians.This is what precisely is wrong with ""Get Smart"" (2008). Although the cast members work very hard, their jokes aren't funny and the audience does not--even remotely--relate to them. That's because the film is rampant with too many carbohydrates, and too much fat. Agent 99 and Maxwell Smart are nothing like the originals (Barbara Feldon and Don Adams). In this film, all of the cast members act like androids, who try to understand early-television's comedic humor, but they just don't get it. They try to turn the whole project into an updated comedy act, but quite a bit is lost in the translation. The whole thing is like Mr. Spock's (Leonard Nimoy's) desperate attempt at intellectualizing, rather than doing an early-television comedy routine. To Spock, it would just be (embarassingly) too human. He would come off--as the cast members do--looking like a Nerd. The whole film is a mess, and its updated 2008 formula just doesn't work.Bring back Whitney Houston, the Indians, Barbara Feldon, and Don Adams. Only then--and only then--could I rate such remakes and sequels with a 9, instead of 1, out of 10. Stay home and take some Geritol or, maybe, a Viagara. Go see the original masters of comedy--Barbara Feldon and Don Adams--at work.",Get Smart
196,GLanoue,Overrated,5,5 January 2011,"Not the worst remake or comedy, but far from the best. It's irritating that so much talent (Arkin, Warburton, Murray) goes to waste. Steve Carell is funny in The Office, but he's not so funny here. Maybe it depends on one's age: I remember (fondly) the original, so perhaps I was judging his performance by how well he nailed Don Adams. He didn't. Adams had great timing and delivery; inevitably, they have to use his catchphrases in this remake (Missed it by THAT much; Would you believe ...?) but Carell doesn't pull them off. As an actor, he undoubtedly didn't want to be judged as an Adams imitator, but he just couldn't find something new to bring to the role. I mean, these expressions would pop up everywhere, especially in schools, the day after Don Adams' Maxwell Smart said them. Here, one can't imagine the same cultural power in anything Carell says. He's just not that sort of personality. Another letdown is Terrance Stamp as Seigfried. Bernie Koppell's (Doc on the Love Boat) performance in the original cannot be outdone. And what about Anna Hathaway? Sure, she looks great, as did Barbara Feldon in the original, but it stops there. Feldon had one of those voices you never forget, a voice that made men melt. Hathaway does not have such a gift, even though she obviously tries to modulate her natural grating whinge as evidenced in her other roles. (Feldon in fact worked in voice-over for years). Finally, what's with the script? I can't understand all the warm gushing over this mediocre effort. For example, what was with the dance scene (that some found so funny)? How was it connected to establishing the character of 86 or 99? Okay, we learn that Smart is a good dancer and physically strong, but so what? And the multiple references to the fact that he used to be fat is just a cheap plot device to establish something, I'm not sure what; maybe his motivation? Agent 86 was supposed to be naive and a bit of a bumbler, not just self confident. Carell just doesn't do it for me. All in all, a decent timewaster, but no belly laughs, just a few chuckles here and there.",Get Smart
197,shiftyeyeddog,"A mixed bag, but Carell and Hathaway carry the film",6,20 June 2008,"I struggled on whether to give this film a slightly positive(6) or slightly negative(5) rating. Carell, Hathaway, Johnson, and Arkin all do a fine job and are quite enjoyable, but the writing is fairly lame in parts, and the rest of the supporting cast has major issues. Steve Carell has shown with Dan in Real Life and Little Miss Sunshine that he can do some different roles - which is good, because when he does straight-up comedies he seems to play the same character every time. It is a very entertaining character, but he's in danger of being typecast. He and Anne Hathaway have a good chemistry here, and carry most of the movie fairly well. I wish Dwayne Johnson had more to do, as I find him quite entertaining, but his career is going in directions I'm not liking. The inclusion of characters Bruce and Lloyd is the worst kind of shameless marketing. They exist here only to justify the release of a direct-to-DVD tie-in movie, ""Bruce & Lloyd Out of Control"", releasing only ELEVEN DAYS later. The film's lowest point is the completely pointless, humorless cameo by Bill Murray. What the hell was the point of that? Like the cast, the writing has its ups and downs as well. In the end, though, the appeal of the leads won out and I can give a reserved thumbs-up to the movie as a whole.",Get Smart
198,LeroyBrown-2,A couple of big laughs but not enough to recommend.,5,7 February 2009,"""Get Smart"" is one of the iconic TV shows of the the 1960s. After all it spoof one of the greatest icon of the the decade, James Bond. The show was escapist fun with a few action scenes thrown in. The creators, Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, took regular sitcom humor right to the edge at the time and sometimes it borders on the surreal if not stepping over completely. They took every opportunity available to add a gag or a one liner. It was of course a hit and miss situation but they had more hits than misses. Now we have a movie trying to live up to one of the funniest sitcoms of all time.This big screen adaptation of that classic series is actually the second one. The original Maxwell Smart, Don Adams, appeared in 1980's ""The Nude Bomb"". Anyway just as that movie had to live up to the greatness of the TV show so too does this version. Like the other version this one failed. My main problem with this movie is the tone and pacing. Where as the TV show had a playful tone this movie doesn't have as much of that. I don't know if it's the actors' fault or the director's they just doesn't seem to be enjoying themselves as much as their TV counterpart. Also the pacing is a little slow, the original TV show feels as if a gag or a joke is being thrown at the audience every 30 seconds. This movie have spots where there are no attempt at humor whatsoever.The acting is another problem I have. Steve Carrell's portrayal of Maxwell Smart is not nearly as good as Mr. Adams'. He doesn't have the self confidence or overconfidence that the TV Maxwell Smart had. Part of that probably had to be because they turned his character into a rookie field agent. How much funnier had he been a bumbling veteran agent. Terence Stamp playing Smart's nemesis Siegfried, is also a disappointment. He'd been better playing the character like General Zod from the Superman movies he did. Also Academy Award winner Alan Arkin as the chief just did not get his character right, like Mr. Stamp his performance was too straight. Anne Hathaway never looked hotter as agent 99, and she played the straight man to Mr. Carrell's Maxwell Smart. It would have been funnier had she been the rookie instead of Max. Dwayne ""The Rock "" Johnson continues to be a surprise, he's actually a good actor and here his performance was right on the mark.TV shows turned into movies tend to have cameos, this one has an interesting one. Fans of the old show will remember that Maxwell Smart drove 3 different cars throughout the run of the show. And all three cars make a cameo here a Sunbeam Tiger, an Opel GT, and a Volkswagen Karmann Ghia. Sharp eyed fans will recognize the driver of the Opel as the original Seigfried, Bernie Koppell. Overall this movie has a couple of big laughs but so much of it just didn't work out so just 5 out of 10 stars.",Get Smart

Astle & Matt Ember, based on characters created by Mel Brooks & Buck Henry. Starring: Steve Carell, Anne Hathaway, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Alan Arkin, Terrence Stamp, Patrick Warburton, James Caan & Ken Davitian. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com August, 2008.OVERVIEW:The film opens in Washington, D.C., where Maxwell Smart (Carell) walks in the footsteps of his television progenitor, Don Adams . . . down a corridor of opening and closing sliding-doors and into a telephone booth from which he precipitously drops into the secret headquarters of the spy agency CONTROL. When CONTROL is attacked by its evil rival, KAOS, the identities of its agents are compromised and the Chief (Arkin) has no choice but to promote Smart, who has always dreamed of working in the field with Agent 23 (Johnson).But Smart is teamed with the only other agent whose identity hasn't been compromised . . . the competent, eye-catching Agent 99 (Hathaway). As Smart and 99 get closer to unraveling KAOS' sinister intentions, they discover that evil operatives Siegfried and Shtarker (Stamp and Davitian) are scheming to set off a bomb in Los Angeles where the president (Caan) is attending a concert.REVIEW: 2.5 out of 4 Java Mugs!IT'S A MASTERPIECE OF EPIC PROPORTIONS!... Would you believe a somewhat entertaining popcorn spy movie!Back in the mid-60s, I remember waiting each week for Maxwell Smart's always hilarious ""would you believe"" line. In this film, we wait a long time, and when we get it, it just isn't the same. The original TV series (starring Adams and Barbara Feldon) was written by Mel Brooks and Buck Henry. On this film, they are listed as ""consultants."" They should have written it.The narrative is at its best when borrowing from other films, such as the James Bond series, Three Days of the Condor, and even Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much. But this is also part of the film's problem . . . it doesn't know what it wants to be: A full-blown spy thriller? Or a spoof of the spy thriller genre?We see well-executed stunts, impressive skydiving sequences and exuberant chases . . . the kind of film-making that would catch the eye of a Bond director. But is this what we want to see in a spoof? Do we want James Bond, or do we want Maxwell Smart? We want them both, of course, but not necessarily in the same character.Carell is fine as Smart and wisely does not try to imitate the one-of-a-kind character created by Adams. Hathaway is a competent Agent 99, as sexy as Feldon, though not nearly as funny. The supporting performances are much better than the leads, especially veterans Arkin, Stamp and Caan, who seem much more at home with the film's '60's zeitgeist.But the movie is fun to watch, and in fact . . .IT'S DEFINITELY WORTH $10.00 AT THE MULTIPLEX! . . .

While the jokes are hit or miss, I feel like they do their job most of the time. There isn't a ton to say about this one other than its really enjoyable. It's a good flick to throw on when you don't want a straight up comedy but also not looking for a serious action film. It blends the genres seamlessly. None of it felt forced, and that's always key to a good story. The film looks good, the performances are solid and like I said, the comedy works the majority of the time. If you're looking for a fun, easy watch, this one qualifies as such. My Rating: 7/10",Get Smart
201,zerogirl42,A Remake That Works,9,24 June 2008,"Finally, a movie that doesn't rely on gross-out humor to get a laugh. I'm so sick of that trend in Hollywood to drag out all these disgusting-joke scenes for way too long. Thankfully, Get Smart beckons back to comedies before all the potty-humor took over the screen.I can see why Get Smart wouldn't be for everyone. If you need those R-rated chuckles, this isn't the film for you. There is no dark humor. Get Smart is more slapstick and physical comedy. The jokes are smart and quite witty. You can definitely see Mel Brooks's humor shining in places.There was an elderly couple sitting next to me in the theater and I was scared the silver-haired gentleman was going to crack a rib, he was laughing so hard.I was reluctant to see Get Smart. I loved the original series and could not imagine how it could be done right. I got dragged to see Get Smart by my boyfriend. I'm so glad I gave it a chance.Don't expect a carbon copy of the original. This is a new interpretation with similar characters. If you get caught up hoping that this will be exactly the same as the original, you will miss out on a very good film.One of things I admire about Get Smart is how it deals with plump people. There were a couple scenes where the writers could have taken the easy way out and made some fat jokes. Thankfully, this did not happen and the character(s) were treated with respect and sophistication.Also, there are some nice special effects and action scenes. Just remember, this isn't meant to be Die Hard. The comedy comes first so this won't be back-to-back action.Oh, and there's a funny cameo from the original head of KAOS. I won't spoil it for you.If you're looking for some laughs, this is a great film. One of the best comedies I've seen in awhile.",Get Smart
202,petsteph1,Genuinely funny,8,22 June 2008,"There are movies that try to be funny, movies that shouldn't be but are and the rare movie that is genuinely funny and this is one of them There are a couple of old jokes, but the bulk is pretty original and the laughs keep rolling, interrupted (not much) by great action sequences. Some scenes had me laughing with tears in my eyes and I'd like to see the movie again because I am sure I was still laughing too much into the next scene and missed some other good gags. I couldn't help compare it to the Pink Panther with Steve Martin which tried so hard to be funny and wasn't. Get Smart definitely exceeded my expectations without descending to the toilet humor and innuendo that often passes for 'comedy'. Highly recommended.",Get Smart
203,wliia,A brilliant spot-on adaptation!,10,26 June 2008,"This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Filled with great action and comedy, Get Smart is the TV adaptation that everyone's been waiting for.Steve Carell steps into the shoes of Don Adams as Maxwell Smart, who dreams of becoming an agent. When he's given the job, he teams up with Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway) in order to find out what's happening with Siegfreid (Terrence Stamp).Everything about this movie is spot-on to the original, even the famous opening! There are two great cameos as familiar characters from the show, and it just gets better. This is the best adaptation of a TV show that movies like Bewitched missed out on!",Get Smart
204,griffin84,Get Smart -- What a TV-to-Movie Adaptation should be!,8,19 June 2008,"We went to see this movie at a sneak-peek screening a few days before it came out. First of all, I did have high expectations: both myself and my husband watched this show as kids (on Nick @ Nite and TNT), and after being severely disappointed in many TV show-to-movie adaptations, I did NOT want to walk out feeling like I had wasted my time.And I'm happy to say that every single one of my expectations was met! The movie is great, unbelievably funny, and, from what I've seen of the original series, incredible faithful to the idea of the original premise of the TV show. And, let's face it, Steve Carrell was the ONLY person to play Max Smart. Anyone who has seen the show and watched Don Adams knows that Carrell is perfect for this role. While Anne Hathaway and Dwayne Johnson are great in their roles (I am honestly impressed with Johnson's acting chops, he is one of the few wrestlers-turned actors who is earning his keep in Hollywood), Alan Arkin helped make this movie for me. I can't think of any else better for the Chief. Fans of the original show will NOT be disappointed. Between appearances by Fang, Agent 13 (Bill Murray in a terrific cameo), and Hymie the Robot (played in a quick spot by the PERFECT casting choice), the script is great, as though it could have been written by Mel Brooks himself.While 'Get Smart' is not going to go down as movie of the year (sorry, 'Iron Man' and 'The Dark Knight' can fight out for that one), it's definitely a great comedy that does not disappoint.8 out of the 10 stars.",Get Smart
205,MidnightWarrior,Pays little homage to series,5,21 June 2008,"The only ""things"" in Get Smart that identify it with the series are pretty much the items in the mueseum, the opening/closing entering/exiting sequences, a few familiar catch phrases, the GET SMART intro theme score and the familiar character names.If you're looking for anything ""Get Smart"" related things beyond those mentioned, forget about it. The buck stops there.That is not to say that this film is a bad one or anything else. In light or in comparasion to the television series, this film falls flat on it's face. There are so many deviations from the original source, that the nature of the entire film is so completely changed from what it sets out to be.Had they not put anything Get Smart related in the film, it would have been a great spy film. In fact, you could actually watch this film and ignore the fat that they're trying to make a film using the ""Get Smart"" trademark, and you'd be surprised at how funny and entertaining it is to watch.Anne Hathaway, although she looks good, is too young for someone as old as Steve Carrell. Carrell is a pretty darn funny person and he does a great job of being funny. However, he just tries too hard to be himself and acts less and less like Don Adams.Nevertheless, the film was a pretty good spy film to watch. 5/10",Get Smart
206,jjcremin-1,Not bad movie based on a sixties TV show,7,30 June 2008,"Saw this with my siblings, in laws, and nieces and nephew last night. If you don't take this seriously, it's a romp. Could have been better. Must have missed the part how the Control office got so completely ransacked and who did it but that scene was definitely odd.Carell is the master of deadpan and Hathaway got to do some great stuff while looking great. The Rock as the double agent plays his role with a straight face. Arkin gets a lot of screen time which is good. Getting an Oscar for being a funny Gramps in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE has given him a bit of a comeback. A lot of borrowings from other movies are in this. Besides some of the famous quotes of the TV show itself, which were used sparingly. there was a villain very much resembling ""Jaws"" of the Roger Moore as James Bond movies. Hathaway recalls Laura Croft and the stapling joke, to me not that funny, was done twice was also done by Arnold when he was the top action star.Terrance Stamp plays bad quite good though his demise was a bit of a let down. Some jokes did work very well. The dancing competition where Carrell dances with a fat partner was quite some. There's a bathroom scene where Agent 86 stops what he's doing to hear what the Russians are saying and when they stop, he does what he has to do again. That was original and funny.Good use of the Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. All in all, way too derivative to be a classic but a lot of fun.",Get Smart

Carrell was flawless and hilarious, he kept you laughing all the way through. To be honest i never saw any episode of the late series Get smart, but if it's anything like the movie it must be full with laughs and spy action. wonderfully executed by Peter Segal he really hits the mark. One of the best adaptation's i have ever seen. A very funny spoof. The best spoof of the year no doubt!Maxwell Smart, Agent 86 for CONTROL, battles the forces of KAOS with the more-competent Agent 99 at his side might not sound as interesting and exciting as it actually is. the film is clever, witty, some action was good exciting and full of energy. actors Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway did superb in working together and had the right relationship that made the movie that much funnier! also star ""the rock"" played the role good and guest star Dalip Singh (also known as great khali) did brilliantly and played his role very good and really ripped off jaws (in the James bond films). overall funny spy spoof and very very worth your time...go see it! 9/10",Get Smart

I saw an interview with Anne Hathaway and Steve Carell that made me take the leap and watch it today with three friends. We were in fits of laughter, as was the rest of the audience.

She has just enough attitude to try and put Maxwell Down a peg or two.Dwayne Johnson plays Agent 23, the suave James Bond type of spy. But is allowed to ham it up for a few laughs..The start of the movie gives a brief nod to the original show by some memoriblia from the original . This will later be seen again , I will try not to reveal too much.Look for the appearances of the Control Agents in the film here and there.Also, look for a cameo of one the old shoes actors.

Then again, Steve Carell actually has screen presence, unlike the vast majority of TV-comedy movie-star wannabees (like from SNL), so he carries the movie with some good assists from his co-stars. They should have played the theme music just a tad more -- although I suspect they didn't want to overdo it.The plot was nothing compelling, but at least it was clear the movie was built around a plot -- again, more than you can say for a lot of these TV-to-movie knockoffs. The final chase (with the plane, SUV and train) was also unexpectedly different, and only suffered from less-than-convincing blue-screen work.Thumbs up.",Get Smart
213,beaconb,Thank you IMDb viewers!,9,1 July 2008,"I had seen the rottentomatoes.com reviews of the film and was somewhat reluctant to see it, but then I read all the favorable comments from the IMDb reviewers and decided to go. I'm so glad I did! I haven't laughed out loud in a movie theater in a long time. I got sucker punched by ""Super Bad"", because the rotten tomato critics, and IMDb reviewers, seemed to all rave about it. After being totally disappointed by several r-rated comedies, I decided that maybe a pg-13 movie had a chance. Some reviewers had complained that there was too much action. I don't know why they thought that. Maybe they thought it would be like an episode of Frasier or Cheers; perhaps they thought ""it's a comedy so it all has to be funny dialog"". There is action, but its all part of the plot, and gives you a little time to recover from some of the laughs. They paid just enough homage to the TV series. Steve Carrell is so hilarious that it would have been a waste of his talent to try and just mimic Don Adams. Some of the jokes went over most of the audience's heads; but it's good to have some high-brow humor mixed in. They had a few gags on par with ""Super Bad"" and other gross-out movies, but a few was tolerable and actually funny when not overdone. All the acting was great and there was even a funny little scene with Bill Murray. As funny as Steve Carrell was, the two ""high-tech geeks"" almost stole the show. If the writers can keep it up, I look forward to many sequels.",Get Smart
214,piksplanet,Get Smart is Carell's party!!,7,21 June 2008,"Get Smart is among the surprise releases on Hollywood's list of 2008 Summer Blockbusters. With more hyped projects such as Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, and Indiana Jones doing the rounds at the theaters; and with Hancock, Hellboy 2 and The Dark Knight still to come; for some other movie to grab the attention of audiences would be quite bizarre. Speed Racer, Prince Caspian, The Happening, tried - and didn't grab as much of their anticipated share. Get Smart, although not as big a project, might just go in the league of Prince Caspian when it comes to being a Summer Blockbuster.First things first.. Get Smart is an adaptation of Mel Brooks and Buck Henry's television series. The series garnered critical acclaim in the mid 60's. They starred Don Adams in the lead role as Maxwell Smart, an undercover agent for a secret U.S. Government Spy Agency called CONTROL. Their nemesis was a terrorist organization called KAOS. I have never seen the television series, so I will not be able to throw in any sort of comparison between that and the film. Don't judge anything by that.Steve Carell is someone I have a huge amount of respect for after being practically awed by his hilarious Prime Time show The Office, his portrayal of The 40 Year Old Virgin, and also his small cameo in Bruce Almighty. In this 2008 revamp of the hit series, he stars as Maxwell Smart a.k.a. Agent 86 (A weird number for a top-class secret agent. It has no significance whatsoever!). With a team of CONTROL agents, they must take down KAOS.The leaders of the respective organizations are portrayed by rather elderly men. Alan Arkin plays The Chief, head of CONTROL. And Terence Stamp plays Siegfried, the leader of KAOS. Both, fit right in to their roles in the presence of a cast who are half their age! Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson turns up another fun performance as Agent 23. Dalip 'The Great Khali' Singh also has a role in this film as Siegfried's handyman. Watch out for him. He is the cause of many 'aww's' and 'ooh's' among the female-going audience. Although I still fail to believe that the pig he fell on, nor him, died after that God-knows-how-many thousand feet drop! I'm seeing Anne Hathaway for the first time since The Devil Wears Prada. She plays Agent 99 (Now that's a cool number for a secret agent!). The chemistry between her and Carell is all over the place. It's great fun to watch them working together. The expressions Steve Carell makes in certain scenes is just unforgettable. Sequences like the one with Bill Murray, an agent posted inside a tree; the dance with an enormous woman; the one in the lavatory of the airplane, and loads of others, make this film worth a watch.However, my pick of the lot remains the pairing of Masi Oka (Hiro Nakamura from Heroes) and Nate Torrence as Bruce and Lloyd, two wannabe secret agents who develop various gadgets and devices for CONTROL. Their undying love for Maxwell Smart gives us a rib-tickling sequence (refer to the facial expressions in the above still).Get Smart is one of the better spoof movies. I enjoyed Rowan Atkinson's Johhny English immensely. This too, ranks in the same league. The climax, with Ode to Joy from Beethoven's 9th Symphony, is surprisingly funny given the parodied Bush'ism from the U.S. President.After the no-show that was The Happening, watch this one for a break from the big blockbuster films that are coming out all through the summer. Get Smart. You won't be disappointed.7/10 overall. Full score for Ode to Joy in the climax, and what followed for Siegfried!",Get Smart
215,the_weirdo,Smart and Funny,7,21 June 2011,"Combined genres are little risk-free than single ones. For example in a RomCom movie, if romance doesn't work comedy might come in handy, or in a Romantic-Tragedy, if the tragedy is not tear jerking, romance might ignite few passion points. Anyway, the point is - combined genres are not money-losers.Nowadays, there is a trend of Action-Comedy, and it works. 'Get Smart' is not exactly action-comedy, rather comedy-action. Two agents - Steve Carrel (Funny and Clever) and Anne Hathaway ( Breathtakingly beautiful and Smart) - one new to the role and another pro - collaborate together to foil the Russian KAOS of a nuclear catastrophe, slowly get attracted towards each other. 'The Rock' gets a small but interesting role. And Guess who are the some of the bad guys - our own The Great Khali and the one that played Azamat Bagatov in Borat ( he is the only person who snores when awake). Yes, there are few moments when you will pause to finish your laughs.I had liked Peter Segal's '50 First Dates' and hated 'Naked Gun 33 1/3' and 'Anger Management'.

216,dsa_ca,Good old blundering spy with nice new packaging,8,30 June 2008,"First thing first, I never saw or heard of the T.V series. So this review is not a comparison of movie with the series. Get smart the new action comedy kinda spoof is very much a brainless entertaining affair. But with an excellent casting of corny and humorous Steve carol and elegant and beautiful Anna Hathaway, decently supported by rock and Alan Arkins make this a fun ride (except for the clichéd Backroom Techno agent geeks).The story is not much to scratch the audiences head, a high tech U.S secret service group is up against a cold war era Russian terrorist group, which is out to kill the U.S president and has there hands on Bio-chemical weapons. So our recently promoted fumbling agent Smart along with his beautiful and fierce (and also old with a face of a young woman) new partner has to travel to Moscow to fight the terrorist and also entertain the audience which they do. Steve Carell's dry humor blends perfectly with the fierce emotions of Anne Hathaway to make up for the thin storyline which does not offer much except for last minute twist by a main character going rogue. There is not much to say or talk about this movie which can be just seen, enjoy and forget kind of flick. Blundering spies are not always fun and today's time are a cliché in action comedy genre, hence it's a surprise that this goes on to entertain the audience and brings enough twists for saving the movie from being drag. The movie does not excite the audience but keeps them giggling all the time. Overall, this flick is an enjoyable but forgettable fair to say the least.",Get Smart

The acting is great (seems like the most fun Alan Arkin has ever been in in a movie) Carell is up to his old tricks and it is more than welcome and you can't tell me that Anne Hathaway was not the hottest chick with a number for a name you have ever seen in your life. Come on, say it. There, don't you feel better? The chemistry between Carell and Hathaway is great, and the action actually kept you interested in the movie. Also keep an eye out for Bill Murry as the agent in the tree and even 'Doc' Bernie Kopell as a guy in a car with a fake mustache. Very well done, if you HAVE to remake TV into movies - THIS is the way to do it. Hollywood take note.",Get Smart
218,gevalero,"Awful, just awful.",1,28 June 2008,"This is one of the most insipid movies I have ever seen. After about an hour and 20 minutes I just completely gave up and left the theater. Whenever I watch the old show I can't help but constantly laugh, as much as I tried to do the same with the movie I could not laugh once, not once. The only remotely funny joke was the one about Max asking how to get the bad guys to take the cyanide pill he is equipped with and guess what, they took that one right out of an episode I watched a couple of months ago. The theater I saw this was fairly packed and even the usual group of people who'll laugh at anything was pretty silent. Instead of wasting millions of dollars the producers would have provided audiences with a much better entertainment if they had simply edited about 4 old episodes and shown them instead of this piece of garbage. It's a shame Hollywood can be so good at blowing things up but so terrible at providing laughter and excitement. And regarding Hathaway as agent 99, my only recommendation to her would be to never again in her life try comedy again, ever. It's just not for her, period. After watching Carrell as 86 I would do the same thing but I realize this is what he does for a living and he has to live off something. At any rate, something good came out of this experience. By leaving early I was able to reduce the cost of parking to the exact amount of change I was carrying. Guess things could have been worse.",Get Smart
219,gbx06,Good adaptation,6,20 July 2008,"I was never a fan of Get Smart and this is what really kept me a little reluctant to see the film, yes I watched several episodes of the series but never actually existed a connection between it and I, but Steve Carell and all the beauty of Anne Hathaway convinced me to come to see the film, and I must say that I enjoyed the result and laugh as long ago I happened with a movie.It isn't the best film of the genre but you can note that the advisory in the script by Mel Brooks was enough to make an interesting and mostly healthy comedy, away from a thousand times movie made about jokes related to sex, and I don't say that because they bother me I say this because most films that use them are lost in ""how to make the scene more bizarre and fun"" rather than make a story more interesting.Having said that I can summarize that I liked Get Smart, it made me laugh healthily, Carell achieves a performance and convincing tribute as Maxwell, but definitely the most comedians are Alan Arkin and James Caan, I'm grateful for the brief appearance of Murray, Anne is beautiful as always, and even ""The Rock"" makes me laugh. It has too a good editing that makes the whole film agile and in short all the elements combine to make a good movie summer (much better than Speed Racer) and entertain as the pure Hollywood style.",Get Smart

221,paul_tremblay,"...not a spoof, not original, not funny...",6,29 June 2012,"The original TV show was never a hilarious, side-splitting, Mack Sennett-like comedy show. Buck Henry and Mel Brooks meant to display a sarcastic spoof of both the spy genre and the Cold War era and they achieved their goal seamlessly. A great way to follow it up, nearly half a century later, is to adapt both the humor and setting to today's mores, politics and sensibility. So what went wrong? It could be a simple lack of wit, an unwillingness to push the situations and the joke toward the absurdist side of the track, just flat writing or, sometimes worse, a dull visual (or literal) rendition of the writing. The fact that the show starts with a technically modernized version of the numerous doors/gates Max is walking through at the start of every show is already indicative of the lack of imagination we are about to be served with. The cone of silence episode is so bad it's good: at once pointless and a Xerox copy of the original (plus the CGI, of course) The film suffers from too much reliability on the original: Agent 13's tree episode is a great example as it should appeal to boomers' memory of the agent we only saw the face of, but falls flat to viewers who have no idea who the initial 13 was. However the ""fall flat"" syndrome applies here: whether the spoof is on the original, or the film attempts to be original, Bill Murray and Steve Carell's scene is just unfunny, quite sad actually. The re-expression of the famous line about the suicide pill (""How do I get them to take it"") is just that: a re-iteration of the line, a photocopy unadorned, so to speak. Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway) walks in disgust at this point and we share her pain. Other good scenes fall flat (sorry for the repeat, but it happens a lot in the movie), for instance: and escaping Max uses the old Control gadgets off a museum only to (metaphorically and literally) running out of gas (and battery) once out of the museum. End of the joke. Oh no, the original Siegfried happens to be outside the museum. Ooops, he's rear ended. Next scene. I think Turan in the LA Times rightfully said that it was a better action flick than it was a comedy. Agreed. The humor is there, at times, will make you smile sometimes, laugh once or twice, but for the most part it is even as in monotonous even...",Get Smart
222,keiichi73,"Fun, light summer entertainment",7,20 June 2008,"As I was watching Get Smart, I came to the delighted realization that the filmmakers weren't trying to do a spy spoof here, but rather a loving tribute to spy movies with a lot of comedy thrown in. This is the right approach, as the now-tired Austin Powers franchise has pretty much run the spy spoof idea into the ground. Director Peter Segal (a veteran of many past Adam Sandler comedies) tries and succeeds at doing something rare. Get Smart is silly enough to work as a comedy, but at the same time, contains some truly impressive action sequences that would be right at home in just about any summer blockbuster that had a slightly more serious mind.I cannot claim to be an expert on the original 1960s TV series created by Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, but I do have enough knowledge to know that this is a fitting and loving tribute that won't insult fans of the show, or alienate newcomers with countless in-jokes. The casting of Steve Carell as the well-meaning and often bungling secret agent, Maxwell Smart, was a great decision. Carell is able to capture the spirit of the performance of late actor, Don Adams, while not trying to ape Adams' distinctive voice and mannerisms. He fits comfortably into the role, and does not make Smart into an incompetent goof. He plays the part as a man with some obvious intelligence, but things don't often go the way he intends. It's a very likable comic performance, and Carell even gives the character a lot more personality than I expected walking into the film.As is expected, the plot is mainly something to hang a lot of situations for Smart to be in over his head. He starts off as an analyst for CONTROL, a top secret government spy organization devoted to thwarting the terrorist designs of the evil organization KAOS. Smart dreams of being a field agent, and has even taken the test eight separate times, only to be turned down each time by the Chief (Alan Arkin), who thinks Smart belongs as an analyst. When KAOS launches a surprise attack on CONTROL headquarters, killing most of the field agents, the Chief has no choice but to promote Smart, and send him off on the latest mission. He is teamed up with Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway) to travel to Russia and uncover a secret weapons factory where the evil organization is developing nuclear weapons to target America. With the aid of Agent 23 (Dwayne Johnson) back at the base, Smart and Agent 99 will attempt to stop head KAOS agent, Sigfried (Terrence Stamp), from carrying out his master plan of destruction.Get Smart is breezy, frequently very funny, and never once slows down enough to become dull. This is one of those movies where you can tell that the cast is having a great time, and that joy carries through on the screen. The movie is a comedy, but the action scenes and stunt work on display are truly first rate. What's perhaps most impressive is that the movie finds a perfect way to blend the silliness and the spectacle, so that the two halves never seem out of place. The entire cast play the comedy as if they are smart people who can't believe what they've just done, or what is happening to them. This is a comedy that laughs with the characters, not at them. There's a scene where Maxwell and Agent 99 have to crash a lavish party being thrown by a suspected enemy agent, and Smart winds up dancing with an obese woman. A lesser movie would have mocked the woman, but here, the movie finds humor in the situation in other ways. The fact that the woman winds up with the final laugh, and that it's not at her expense, was very welcome.Aside from the very strong lead from Carell, Anne Hathaway brings a certain sexy yet vulnerable charm to her role. She's a good match for him as a co-star, and they create a good ""buddy"" chemistry as the film goes on. They're slightly less successful when they're asked to bring romantic chemistry into the relationship, but it's not really their fault, since the film does seem to be trying to start a franchise, so I'm sure there's time for it to build in a sequel. Former pro-wrestler Dwayne Johnson drops his ""the Rock"" title for the first time, meaning he's finally serious about moving beyond his past and becoming a real actor. He manages to get some laughs here, and even has some charisma, leading me to believe he could be the rare wrestler to move onto an actual career in films. There are even some fun cameos, including James Caan as the President of the United States, and Bill Murray turns up as a fellow field agent who has the unfortunate task of having to pose as a tree while undercover. There are some more to look for, some for fans of the original show and some for fans of Saturday Night Live, but I'll leave those for you to discover yourself.Get Smart is probably one of the stronger TV-to-film adaptations to come along in a while. It's not Earth-stopping entertainment, and it never pretends to be. It's merely a light and simple summer comedy that's a great way to kill an afternoon. We need those during the summer as much as we need the big blockbusters, so it's fortunate that this is a very good one.

I guess it is supposed to be based on that old TV series - that wasn't funny either, so at least it's true to its source material.Hopefully, now, after another multi-million dollar loss, studios will realise what a one trick pony Carrell is, and stop throwing money at him now after this latest flop.",Get Smart

For the most part i liked it, the jokes were just great in the movie. Acting was good, Steve Carellel was excellent, Dwayne Johnson was pretty funny too. Good action, keeps you on your feet the whole time. Score was good, I did'nt like how they accused him of being a double agent, i fall for the good people really easily. All in all, this was a terrific movie, i enjoyed it very much.

225,randy_kay,I can't understand the negativity...,9,15 July 2012,"I know hardly anyone reads these reviews after there's about 50 of them but what the hell -- I'll put yet another one out there.One reviewer actually wrote ""Why does Max use the crossbow in his Swiss Army knife in the washroom of a plane to try to get untied when he could have used the knife?"".... That's the joke! That's the humour right there! 1) There's actually a crossbow in his Swiss knife and 2) He's basically a bureaucratic office agent going out into the field for the first time so he's always doing things -- that's a big part of the humour in this movie.I thought it was a great movie. Great acting. I thought Carell would be annoying but he was great and Anne Hathaway was amazing as 99 and she's very sexy in this too. I love the workaround they came up with for why she looks so young compared to Carell -- she had to have radical plastic surgery to change her identity or something so she decided to look much younger while she was at it. That whole conversation they had on the plane talking about ageing was incredibly funny. I roared out loud at it. Also, the computer animation was great too in that it looked so real that you didn't even notice it, unlike the garbage in Independence Day etc. etc.The musical score by Trevor Rabin was amazing. I was just reading where he used to write in the band 'YES'. Well, I'll forgive him for all of that stuff since he did such a great job of this movie.",Get Smart
226,adam_uk09,Much much better than I expected.,8,27 August 2008,"After seeing Johnny English countless times, I thought that this would never be able to match up to the wit and sheer enjoyment at watching Rowan Atkinson making blunder after blunder.However, I was pleasantly surprised, whilst it was fairly immature in some respects; Get Smart had a depth which the English film lacked. The acting was also much better (Anne Hathaway - Natalie Imbruglia for instance.) The story also seemed to be much more substantial, with each scene being necessary for the continuation of the film.Fantastically funny is the only phrase I can use to describe Get Smart, I was in hysterics for at least half of the film, Steve Carell was leaps and bounds ahead of Atkinson in his performance; and even Dwayne Johnson provided a decent turn of pace.The only downside with the movie was the overwhelming sense of sentimentality towards the finale, but that is only a minor consideration.A huge success in every respect!! A must see!",Get Smart
227,yoncenator,Review for Smart fans,6,24 June 2008,"I thought the original series was one of the funniest, most classic shows. The combination of Mel Brooks and Buck Henry and sometimes Don Rickles was lightning in a bottle. A modern movie would never compare. That being said this film was entertaining and a 'good enough' tribute to the series. I must say I thought they really botched some of the most simple laughs from the series (um cone of silence). Slapstick is never enhanced in the least bit by cg. The joke is ""Chief, I demand we use the cone of silence.. (reluctantly) oh alright (long detailed instructions) beat.. What?"" belly laughs every time. How difficult is that? Apparently so difficult that it needs a full 3 min cg w/ no laughs at all. There were some good laughs but the shining light in this movie is Anne Hathaway! She's a great actress (even w/ not so great lines) and really put the time in the gym for this movie. Absolutely gorgeous. The plot line is predictable (for me anyway), the stunts pretty unbelievable, and really wasn't like Get Smart hardly at all. Yet still it wasn't boring and had enough relative to the series to keep me interested. A solid 6/10",Get Smart

Then I saw the trailer, and figured all the good shots were in that, more disappointment, and never saw it in the theatres. Now, a few months later, I watch it on DVD, and I find it a great ( not perfect) fun mindless good movie. I dread wrestlers in Movies, but the Rock was a fun character, and the Khali, tho a horrible Wrestler, but fit the ""jaws"" position fine, tho man, he needs to get his chin reshaped, and Alan Arkin made a great Chief, Carrell(sp) was a good 86, alittle less ditzy, at least.

229,Montaya_111,Insert Action Movie Name here.,5,26 June 2008,"Well the first thing I have to say is that Steve Carell cannot replace Don Adams. I went into this movie expecting it to be terrible. I must admit I was pleasantly surprised, I enjoyed the movie. Not with the name of Get Smart but with a different name. It was quite entertaining funny and witty.The movie was entertaining overall, Dwayne Johnson, Alan Arkin, Ken Davitian, Terrance Stamp were all entertaining, they are all great actors and I believe they brought something necessary to the movie.Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway, well Steve Carell of course did not make the bar that Don Adams set. And Anne Hathaway was not even close to what Barbara Feldon was and what she did in the original Get Smart. Then lets get down to it. Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway were not suited together, he is old enough to be her father, they tried to connect it up in the movie but it didn't stop my gag reflex when they kissed. Not only that Agent 99 was several inches taller then Max in the original TV show, they should have not made them the same height.I can go on forever about the issues with what they did to butcher the original TV show.There were some good points about it, there was some great scenes in the movie. They reunited all the old cars, the Sunbeam Tiger, The VW Karmann Ghia, and the Gold Opal GT driven by a Cameo Appearance of Bernie Koepell.The movie would have been better if it wasn't trying to live up to the original 1965 Version of Get Smart. HOWEVER, as a standalone movie it was worth the watch.5 out of 10 Simply because it was Supposed to be Maxwell Smart Agent 86 of CONTROL.",Get Smart
230,imdb-21622,Moments of humor,6,9 May 2010,"First off, I understand they were not going to duplicate the original characters. But Maxwell was supposed to be kind of clueless. In this movie he was mostly not clueless.I would have preferred a bit more of the clueless Maxwell.The movie had some laugh out loud moments. Props to the writers. There were also some slower parts where I did not laugh much.The rock was pretty funny, as usual. Not sure why he's funny. He just is.I liked agent 99 mostly. She was cute, and had some good moments. I think the original 99 character needed to be a bit stronger anyway so having her play as a stronger female was all good.In general, I think there was enough humor in here for most people. Some dumb stuff I did not like, but that's humor for you. Not every movie can be Airplane ( one of the funniest movies ever made of course.) I am surprised by both the very positive and very negative reviews. I felt this movie was pretty average.",Get Smart
231,Dream_seeker,Hit its mark....Perfectly!,7,21 October 2008,"I have to admit...there are certain remakes that i can't say i don't approve but it seems most of them this year are pretty good and, ""Get smart"" is of no exception. Director Peter Segal made this movie with one intention.....to make you laugh hysterically. Steve Carell is definitely Maxwell smart and if Don Adams was alive today i'm sure he would be VERY pleased that someone is taking care of his mantle pretty well. Anne Hathaway is a very Sexy agent 99 and she did her part....seductively! The story is pretty much straight laced and you will follow along very fast but you will be mostly laughing more than getting into the story...Masi Oka (Hiro from, ""Heroes"") as Bruce and Nate Torrance as Lloyd did their part pretty good as the comic relief but then again; the movie is one big comic relief from the summertime blues. All in all, you have to really like this movie. The jokes are fast paced and very witty; I doubt it would stand against the other big name movies but in the comedy department this stands already on its own two feet. And I would recommend it.",Get Smart
232,bostonlatin,Totally surprised at how good this was,10,22 June 2008,"To be redundant to the other positive comments - This movie combines mostly intelligent humor, wit, pays homage to the old series in the right way, romance, action, and nice location scenery. Rather than repeating the original campy 60's show that I loved they made it an original. Even turning the ""missed it by that much"" and ""sorry about that chief"" into a different meaning.A have a few quibbles with the unnecessary Bush bashing and kissing scenes. The movie easily could have been PG not PG-13 but oh well. And the previews showed too much. Completely wasted cameo from a superstar.They succeeded where this easily could be failure.Steve Carell - in each movie you either love him or hate him. This one he did it for me. He does need to expand on his acting.",Get Smart
233,jdn-82931,disappointing,4,9 October 2021,The lead actor is very irritating and too much of a doofus with no charm or redemptive character. I just could not watch him. I think he was the guy in Foxcatcher where he was good. This is not a good role for him. This is not a good role for Hathaway either but she is always watchable and she tries hard. I like the actors in the office. They saved this film and Duane Johnson is consistent in all his roles.This is not good but perhaps it just didn't age well. It can be tough for comedies sometimes.,Get Smart
234,ZebraGreg,A genre bending Spy-Action-Romantic-Comedy Movie,7,21 June 2008,"Get Smart should be taken on its own terms. It works best as a spy spoof of course, but it disappoints if you are expecting another Austin Powers movie. It has the soul of a romantic- comedy and the best part is the chemistry between Anne Hatheway's 99 and Steve Carell's Maxwell Smart. The chemistry of Steve Carell with most of the supporting cast is outstanding, and includes the two younger geeks, Alan Arkin's chief and Dwayne Johnson's 23. I thought the dialog from the series like ""Missed it by that much,"" and ""Sorry Chief"" did not work that well. I liked the shoe phone gag though.",Get Smart
235,harsawa,Would you believe the big screen Get Smart is actually very funny? You should.,9,30 June 2008,"No, Get Smart isn't going to be the highest pinnacle of film making to come. But considering how much drek has appeared in recent comedies, especially comedies based on popular TV classics (Bewitched being the worst in recent memory), Get Smart is actually pretty good. Would you believe that? The first thing is the quality of the performances. Certainly, Steve Carrel is no Don Adams, but Carrel's performance as Smart is honestly better than I expected. The reason why: He knows he's not Don Adams, so he doesn't try to be. I expected Carrel to try and imitate Don Adam's down to his accent, and do a crappy job at it. He doesn't, Carrel instead focuses on crafting his own version of Maxwell Smart, and he does a damn good job. This screen version of Smart won't out-do Adams version, but he doesn't try to, which is a good move really. If only Steve Martin realized this when he did The Pink Panther. Anne Hatheway does a good job as 99, and Terrence Stamp puts a little menace into Siegfried (Although in terms of humor, Siegfried is one of the lower points of the film.) and dear god dare I say it, The Rock is solid, funny and even a little cool as Agent 23.The plot of the film.. isn't really all that great, but thankfully it doesn't read too much into it. The plot is full of clichés, but as with the TV series, it's really just a skeleton to put a background setting behind the characters. They make up the meat of this movie, they just use the skeleton to get themselves into something funny. And funny is something this movie does great. There were several moments I found myself bursting into full blown laughter, a hard thing to give to me. The funny thing is, a lot of the jokes have been done a lot recently, but somehow this film pulls them off. Is it the direction of the film? The scripting? Maybe even the acting? I don't know, but the fact is it works. This is the film a lot of recent comedies tried to be, but failed to be. There are some moments where the humor even kind of resembles the old TV series. There are of course more modern jokes and crude jokes, but even they feel like the sort of thing the original creators would have done had the censors of the time let them.So, all in all, would you believe the big screen Get Smart is actually very funny? You should. For those who love the TV show, they're going to find a well made tribute and update to the TV series. For those who don't know it, hopefully this movie will make them fans. It appeals to those nostalgic for the show, but it will bring laughter to those who haven't even heard of it.",Get Smart
236,puffball97,"Sorry About That, But Would You Believe It Misses It By Too Much",2,26 June 2008,"These are all the Maxwell Smart clichés, but all these clichés ring true for this dreadful update of the fabulously funny 1960s spy spoof series. Don Adams had gone to the great CONTROL agency in the sky, and had left an unfortunate heir to his position. That heir is Steve Carell. Carell has no egomaniacal bone is his body and none of what he has done in the movie is his fault. It is the jarring script and the filmmakers who botched the movie with the incomprehensible combination of the classic Adams slapstick and clichés (one walk scene, one shoe phone, each of the clichés I put in my headline for the review) and the action scenes from Arnold Schwarzenneger, Chuck Norris, and Sly Stallone movies. That is the real problem of the movie.The rest of the cast sleepwalk their way throughout. Anne Hathaway does a fair to middling job as Maxwell Smart's straightarrow partner agent 99. But she does not make us forget Barbara Feldon. Alan Arkin is well Alan Arkin as the chief. He has done so many memorable comedies in the 1970s and 1980s and in one scene is re-teamed 34 years later with his ""Freebie and the Bean"" co-star James Caan, who plays a dimbulb George W. Bush-like president. I'd say Caan, with little screen time, has the best role in the movie. Dwayne the Rock Johnson has little to do in the movie as agent 23 and forces the slapstick onto himself. Terence Stamp, best known as the diabolical General Zod in the Superman series, gets to play Siegfried, the evil head of KAOS, and CONTROL's archenemy organization, doesn't make such a convincing villain in a comedy. And lastly, there is a sad cameo by Bill Murray, playing the ever-hiding Agent 13. You see his face, but not his hair, and even he doesn't look happy.The complex plot takes us from Washington to Moscow to Los Angeles in order for Maxwell Smart and Agent 99 to destroy KAOS' evil plan to take over the world and kill the president during a symphony concert at Walt Disney Hall in the end. Throughout this long trip, many gags are forced. Spoiler alert: an airplane bearing Don Adams original surname is one. Then the dancefest in Moscow is over-the-top with too many vulgarities and gross scenes abound. Also, there are obscene subtitles forced in for good measure as Russians curse, saying that Russians talk trash. Finally we are taken back to our country in Los Angeles for the real climax. What was the point to go to Moscow and the back to the states to seek out KAOS? It just could have stayed in America.The only two gags were the opening and end scenes. First, Carrell doing the Adams strut from door to door and then to an obsolete phonebooth, with an updated rock and roll version of the TV theme. With that same theme at the end, Carrell and Hathaway strut together. Take out all the convoluted middle scenes, keep the beginning and end, and you would have seen the whole movie in five minutes.Oh, and I would have never lived to say this, but would you believe I recently rented ""The Nude Bomb"" with Adams on DVD, tried to remember this, and I liked this little-known movie much better than this recent ""Get Smart?"" But the TV show is the real thing.",Get Smart

But the other actors are great, too. Anne Hathaway does a very good job as 99. But most notably, Dwayne Johnson as 23. I really earned a new respect for him after this movie. Not that he's as good as Carrell or anything, but it's the best performance I've seen by a retired wrestler or other star of some sort. Anyways, I wasn't expecting much from this movie at first, but it delivered and over exceeded my expectations.The movie was funny all throughout.

Could they have done a few things differently - well yes. But they did a great job and I loved that fact that both stars had a fresh take on their respective characters and still paid homage to the original characters. I have read many comments that say the humor was ""above the belt"" and for a completely refreshing change it was. I am so tired of toilet humor and was happy that they did not revert to the whole say the ""f"" word to get a laugh. The bits that were a direct lift from the old series were pulled off beautifully. Classic lines and scenarios were seamlessly worked in and although some newer viewers may not get them well I just hope they take the time to discover what was one of the true gems of television comedy.Bravo to the cast and crew. I see that they set the stage for a sequel and I hope it happens. Also in closing, if Anne Hathaway reads this, please know that I love you.

239,gpaltrow2001,Missed it by THAT much !,7,22 June 2008,"I took my 15 year-old daughter, who had never seen the original show. She thought it was very, very funny. So obviously the makers did something right! I thought it was funny, with some scenes outright hilarious, but it isn't an all-time great comedy. The best thing about the film, EASILY, is Steve Carell. He underplays the part perfectly. It was nice to see that he was a very good agent right from the beginning-- in fact, too good. That decision made his foibles more realistic and fun as he becomes a field agent and not a desk-jockey. Anne Hathaway was a good choice, and I am now picturing outtakes, with Carell busting her up. The movies starts off a little straightforward and not that funny, but the comedy builds and builds, so hang in there and enjoy the ride. I am also pleased by the nice box office opening weekend. It deserved it. I had a choice of taking my daughter to see Zohan, which she wanted to do. I decided not to, because I knew I would be uncomfortable with the borderline R-rated jokes that Sandler stuffs his films with. Good pick on my part, since Get Smart earns it's PG-13 rating without constant sex jokes, but action, language, and jokes that are just past PG. My daughter and I had a good time, and isn't that the point? Finally, some trivia for you-- Get Smart was the first TV show with a big-screen adaptation.

If you think Steve Carrel is funny then you'll be forgiving to this movie. If, like the rest of the world with an IQ higher than 30, you think he's as funny as cancer then you won't like it. But even if you are indifferent to the lead protagonist you are gonna walk out of this crappy flick within the first 20 minutes.It's an absolutely awful waste of talent and the script makes fools of the actors who agreed to play in this colossal let down.

242,bmcdannell,A Pleasant Surprise,8,6 July 2008,"We wouldn't have gone to see this in the theater - the recycling of 60s and 70s pop culture has produced some really dismal results - but it was the last half of a drive-in double feature with Wall-E and our granddaughter has been staying with us this summer and wanted to see Wall-E, so off we went with a carload of pizza, popcorn, drinks, pillows, blankets and all the other drive-in necessities.Not only did we find Get Smart very entertaining, but we all - including our granddaughter - enjoyed it much more than we did Wall-E. True, it had its quota of pre-adolescent body function humor (is Hollywood ever going to get tired of that?) but the very brief barf sight gag was the only one that was irredeemably offensive. There were plenty of genuine laughs for both adults and children.There were also some very interesting aspects to the movie. We thought both Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway did an excellent job with their parts. They didn't so much try to imitate Don Adams and Barbara Feldon as they did interpret their characters - and their interpretations were extremely well done. I confess that I'm ancient enough to be one of the millions of teenage boys hopelessly in love with Barbara Feldon when Get Smart ran on TV, and especially in the dance sequence Hathaway captured her essence charmingly.Perhaps the most interesting point was how the movie differed from the TV series. In the series, Maxwell Smart was portrayed as a total idiot upon whom the gods of fate consistently smiled. Each episode revolved around him bumbling haplessly into terrible trouble and then somehow bumbling his way right back out of it. But in the movie Smart is portrayed as a genuinely intelligent analyst with a burning desire to become an agent. He isn't lucky - he's right - and that was a refreshing change.It's all lightweight stuff to be sure, but it's nice to once in a while be pleasantly surprised by a movie from which you didn't expect much. We were pleasantly surprised by Get Smart.",Get Smart

Dwayne Johnson is also on top form and Terrance Stamp being the driest villain I have ever seen, but the star of the film for me is Alan Arkin who simply kills it with one scene with a swordfish which I have watched too many times to recollect.

244,craigdoolan,"Great cast, light on for laughs",6,10 January 2021,"Enjoyable harmless fun that is not as good as I might of thought, salvaged by a top notch cast. Steve Carell seemed an inevitable choice for Maxwell Smart (I watched the show regularly when I was a kid and couldn't think of a better modern actor for the role) and Alan Arkin is fantastic as always as The Chief, just strange to see him in something not swearing quite as much as usual.I would have expected a lot more laughs in a slapstick manner from a movie based on Get Smart. Fundamentally I think Steve Carell's Maxwell Smart wasn't nearly stupid enough. The scene in the airplane toilet has my 12 year old son in stitches, and I would have expected a lot more of that, leaving it pretty light on laughs throughout.",Get Smart
245,Richard-Nathan,The audience barely chuckled,1,20 July 2008,"The audience sat in silence through almost the entire film, with only a few, rare, occasional chuckles. The character of Maxwell Smart was so inconsistent, I felt whip-lashed. When it is convenient for the plot, Smart behaves like a master spy. At other times, he acts like an imbecile. They lift many classic lines from the television series, but they don't work in this version. The classic ""missed it by this much"" is funny if it is spoken with attempted braggadocio by someone who is an obvious failure - but it loses all humor when spoken by someone who is qualified. To a slightly lesser degree, many of the other characters move at a dizzying pace from skilled to cartoonish incompetent. Siegfried, the main villain, would seem to be intelligent, but he makes decisions that make no damned sense at all. Still, none of the characters in the film is as incompetent as the writers of this mess. I am utterly depressed that so many IMDb users think this was good.",Get Smart
246,Absyrd,Steve Carrell saves the film from mediocrity,7,4 July 2008,"What is it about Steve Carrell that makes him one of the finest comedic actors of the decade? Be it his minimal expressionism (something Jim Carrey couldn't do to save his life), or his uncanny ability to make any character likable, and almost charismatic? Whatever it is, he displays it brilliantly here, and it's one of the few achieving factors of this entertaining, but mostly ordinary comedy/thriller.When an evil corporation reveals the identity of all the agents of a secret anti-terrorist organization, an analyst (Carrell) and an agent who recently got plastic surgery (Hathaway)embark on a pseudo-quest to discover what the terrorists have in mind, and why they were so quick to find out the identity of all the agents. Of course, they want the president dead, and it's up to Carrell and Hathaway to stop them.Many of its gags were forced and predictable, but plenty were also hilarious. The chemistry between the two leads worked well, but not without its doubts, or bits of manufactured romance. After the first dozen twists or so, they began to drag to the point of predictability. However, while its extremely over-the-top climax was a bit obvious, it was also surprisingly involving. You could see miles away what would become of its characters, and that almost detracted from the experience, but Carrell's charm alone kept me engaged, and almost captivated.So overall, the film fails at offering any innovative ideas, considering its plot holds the same intricacies, same twists, and same structure as many other crime-thrillers, but Carrell himself saves it from mediocrity.6.5/10",Get Smart

Carell and Hathaway make a lovely team together, and they make the movie work. it's funny, goofy, and enjoyable. perhaps not Oscar-worthy, but it's the kind of thing that's perfect for when you want a good laugh from a stupid movie.",Get Smart
248,er-guille,Nostalgia and slapstick comedy....,8,7 July 2008,"I just came home from the cinema after seeing this piece of work. I think it was brilliant to cast Steve Carrell as the beloved Max Smart. His performance, while hardly an imitation, captures beautifully the essence of a character that is a classic for most of us, those who saw the series in its original airing and those (me included) that saw it in one of its many reruns. The plot twist and adapting a cold war series to the post cold world era was very good. Anne Hathaway apparently is maturing as an actress, and acted 99 in a style much her own. Not at all as the one Barbara Feldon got us used to, but very good also. The special effects did their job. Not overwhelming the movie, but filling their space. The jokes, just as Mel Brooks had us accustomed to. I think even Don Adams would enjoy this recreation of a classic. Some glitches don't allow me to give this a 10, specially the too long final sequence, and some gadgets we were used to see are absents but all in all, a very solid movie and a very enjoyable experience.Don't miss it",Get Smart

The humor was stupendous with Steve Carrel's wry observations and comments and some superb entertainment from the tech guys. Also, there were a few truly original scenes. In particular, I loved the dance scene, Steve Carrel is a man of iron (or perhaps it was good camera work). There were also elements of true beauty, romance and colour, such as the bike ride with Anna Hathaway and Steve Carrel along the Russian countryside. The action was plentiful too.In short, it was a perfectly balanced movie, with the right shot of humor, originality, action and color. I can't understand why its only a 6.9 on IMDb.

It's obvious he's trying to do the voice, but he ends up sounding like a robot from an old sitcom. ""Danger Will Robinson! This movie sucks!"" He even enunciates like a robot. ""I-am-max-well-smart. I-am-ay(not ah)-con-trol-a-gent."" 10 minutes into it and I desperately wanted to turn it off, thinking OH F***... an hour and half more of THIS! And I should have turned it off, I really should have.Same bulls*** you see in every modern ""comedy"" movie that the writers of the original Get Smart wouldn't even touch because it's not funny in the least.This movie just seems to drag on and on... with the puerile banter that's supposed to be funny (I guess). Max puking all over himself??? DUH HUH HUH... fat guy running into wall... or... me watching him dancing with a fat lady for what seems like a very long time... waiting for something... anything funny to happen... even if it's not that funny... it never happened. Plus tons of Carell's patented deadpan retarded robot. ""My buttocks are really stinging."" OH! HUHUHUHUHAHAAAA!! What an ass. or ""(insert name of gadget), you don't have one of these? hrmmm..."" That's funny how?? And they completely misused the original jokes.Why exactly are they trying to make this show into Mission Impossible or James Bond?? And the touchy feely speech near the end... COME ON!! The humour isn't even similar. Couldn't they just call this movie ""Spy Douche"" since it has zero resemblance to the old show??How about this one... Carell: ""If you want it you'll just have to take it!"" The Rock: ""I know that's what I said!"" Carell: ""I know, I'm just trying to annoy you!"" I felt like Steve was talking to me when he said that. At the end of this movie I screamed in frustration. I wish I had never seen this. Next time I'll ""Get Smart"" and watch the trailer, get my fill of the juvenile one-liners and avoid.This is what I would call a movie for stupid people. I understand stupid people need to be entertained too, but you stupid people have to leave us smart people with something. Don't go destroying the memory of a genius show like Get Smart.",Get Smart
251,mullaryn,Towers above the rest of 2008's comedies.,8,30 January 2009,"I was very pleasantly surprised by this film. I expected yet another comedy trying either to parody every single movie ever made or a rather dull comedy on the level of 'Fat man slips on banana peel, falls face-first into cake.' However, 'Get Smart' turned out to be a very entertaining, mild, amiable comedy which was a pleasure to watch and is just as good the next ten times you watch it.The idea itself is quite common: nuclear standoff, secret agency, unlikely hero, attractive heroine... But after that, the originality of 'Get Smart' begins. The hero is a quite difficult balance of clumsy and adept, and the heroine is not without flaws. Most of the jokes are quite fresh and at least mildly amusing, and even things which normally are crude and make you squirm at the pathetic attempt at humor (such as bare buttocks and references to genitalia) are, for the most part, done very well. Again, there are few such moments in this film. Although there are some... doubtful moments, they are eclipsed by the rest of the film.The movie itself is very dynamic and clear, but that is not what made me like this movie. The acting (from my point of view) was fantastic. Each actor fit flawlessly into the role, and I for one will associate Steve Carell with Agent 86 for some time. Their delivery of the jokes is unstrained, unconstrained, and apt, and the rest of their roles resonate with emotion, laughter, and thought as well. Alan Arkin particularly stood out in this film in his semi-peripheral but hilarious role as 'The Chief'.One note: one of the things that really stood out for me is the Russian dialogues. Unlike most films, the director of 'Get Smart' actually used actors who speak fluent Russian, and almost always translated flawlessly. The overly picayune will of course argue that some things are mistranslated and that oh my goodness the accent is wrong... but personally I applaud Segal for paying attention to a detail which others overlook (I speak and understand Russian, so hearing some gibberish on screen translated into English text quite ruins the moment for me).Should you watch it? Yes. This is a very good comedy, the type that leaves you with a smile on your face at the end and that will have the viewer quoting lines from the movie for some time afterward. The action lover will be satisfied by a very well done car/airplane chase, jump out of an airplane, shootout in a bakery, and some other notable moments. The thinker will like the various little twists and turns the plot (deceptively simple) takes. This movie is definitely not a waste of time. At all.",Get Smart
252,abecipriano,"Laugh Riot, with a pinch of wit and a dash of slapstick",8,22 June 2008,"I saw Get Smart with my wife and a buddy of mine last Saturday, and let me tell you, we were laughing practically the entire movie. From subtle Carrel to over-the-top Carrel, from Anne Hathaway to Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, hell to even their Chief, Alan Arkin, the movie's funny moments were many and well-spaced throughout the show.I only saw the trailer before this, and thank goodness they didn't throw in everything funny there (the comedy ""Tommy Boy"" springs to mind as the movie that had all its funniest moments shown in the trailer so the movie pretty much was tame) because the movie had a lot more comedy to offer.I only saw some of the re-runs of the TV show of Get Smart, but I think that they did a good enough job of giving homage to the TV show while making some updates of the movie, with Steve Carrel giving Maxwell Smart some of his own touches as well.The movie has some witty (read: Smart) moments that not everyone will get, but it has physical comedy for the avid slapstick fan as well.The chemistry between Hathaway and Carrel was realistic, despite the age gap. And there are memorable scenes in the movie, ranging from comedy (like the dance scene) and action (the movie's train tracks and car chase scene). My wife especially loved the deadpan delivery of Alan Arkin as the Chief (especially after the car chase).Overall, it's a worthy movie update of a classic TV show. Fans of the TV show should enjoy this one, and new moviegoers will become new fans as well. Can ""Get Smarter"" be far behind?",Get Smart
253,robertmike57,"It's the Old ""Do an Inferior Remake of the Original"" Trick",3,14 November 2008,"I watched this movie and did find a few isolated sequences funny, but that was about it. Then I watched some of the old Get Smart episodes, which I had not seen for many years. There was some real inspired bits and I had more laughs in 15 minutes than the whole movie.Here's my review of the character in this movie compared to the original TV series: Steve Carrell: playing a different, more sweeter agent 86 than Don Adams. The problem with changing this character came when Steve Carrell tried to deliver all of those catch phrases of the original series. They all fell flat.Anne Hathaway: played a much more assertive down to business agent 99 than Barbara Feldon. This worked fairly well. The chemistry between her and Steve Carrell didn't work that well, Terence Stamp: played a grim intense Siegfried. What was up with that? Siegfried was a quirky screw ball villain. In fact, all of the best KAOS villains of the original series were in some manner odd. Stamp does grim and intense well, it has no business here.Fang: What just a little do nothing dog in this movie. The Fang in the original TV series saved Maxwell Smart's life at least twice. This movie could had used the improved technologies (as well as a talented dog) to give a Fang a quasi super dog status saving Smart from precarious situations, improving on the TV series.Agent 23: Dwayne Johnson was quite good in the movie, adding a nice, if predictable twist at the end.Chief: Alan Arkin was totally wasted here. There was none of the entertaining interactions between Max and the Chief that played well in the series.Agent 13: Bill Murray was stuck in a tree as well as mediocre material. The tree disguise seems rather tame compared to some of the places CONTROL agents were hiding in the series (mail box, Ice cooler, lockers Etc). The alternate scene on the DVD places Steve Carrell in a tree and Bill Murray talking to him is much more funny.My take on other aspects of the movie: action sequences were better choreographed than the TV show, but that's not much of an accomplishment, action sequences were never the point of the TV show. The verbal interplay between Maxwell Smart and others was scarcely present, a huge minus.The movie didn't flow from one situation to the next very well, it wasn't a disjointed mess, but it could had been far better. I'll try to end this review on a positive note: at least it didn't completely trash the original as what happened with the Wild Wild West.",Get Smart

The audience was laughing its collective head off. The jokes are well-timed, well-acted, well-choreographed and all-around funny. However, I have never seen a comedy do action so well. The overall plot is suspenseful, and the fight scenes are as gorgeous as any I've seen (Ms. Hathaway's stunt double in particular). Meanwhile, the film is peppered with tributes to the original show that actually further the plot! The character of Maxwell Smart is portrayed as goofy yet competent, dorky yet lovable. He's a hamsterboy dropped into James Bond's shoes.Probably the most enjoyable part is that everyone gets his or her moment: the old guy gets to kick ass, the fat girl gets to kick ass, the nerds get to kick ass in a nerdly manner.

When the details of the casting was released, I couldn't imagine anyone more perfect than Steve Carrel as Max or Anne Hathaway as Agent 99. Unfortunately, the script was awful and caused a wonderful opportunity to be wasted.The familiar lines of the original television series were used in ways that they made no sense. The relationship between the two star characters -- which was so important to the original series -- was all wrong in the movie. It was so bad, in fact, that I found it difficult to recognize the characters I knew so well and I kept forgetting that I was watching Get Smart.I really believe that this had all of the ingredients to become a hilarious movie, but someone messed up horribly along the way. It came across as if the writers have never even watched the television series, because they didn't seem to know what they were doing. Sadly, this was a waste of a wonderful opportunity to recreate one of the funniest television shows ever.",Get Smart

260,zabelardo,Get Smart Got Dumb,3,24 November 2008,"This one never had the infectious humor the original 60s version had. Steve Carell simply does not have the trademark facial expressions that Don Adams skillfully makes, which made the original GS such a laugh riot. Another omission was the 1960s use of ""canned laughter""(worked great!), and original writers, Buck Henry and Mel Brooks. If they had full creative license on this ""modern"" version- it would have made millions more at the box office.By including a cameo of the original Seigfried, Bernie Koppel- it just showed how desperate this GS was to gain laughs. The lovely Anne Hathaway(The Devil Wears Prada) is the only scene-stealer in this movie. Although she lacked the chemistry Don Adams and Barbara Feldon had.....she still covered her adept secret agent role well. The Rock was way miscast in this movie, as Agent 23. He just tried too hard to portray the brute, with the identity crisis.Wait until this video goes to a 99-cent rental. The movie misses on all points, and could have been a great modern version, if time was spent on writing talent. I gave it three stars simply because of Alan Arkin and Anne Hathaway's performances.",Get Smart
261,Bobster36,Very disappointing,2,16 November 2008,"Having been a great fan of the Get Smart series, I had high expectations for the movie. I could not have been more disappointed. The director and writers completely missed the point. They could have made a movie about a new and naive secret agent and it might have been amusing. But if they wanted do make a movie specifically based on the Get Smart series, they needed to build on the premise that it was a farce about an idiotic agent who somehow always prevails against equally idiotic villains.That's not the Get Smart movie. The movie is about a fact-driven analyst who finally gets his chance to be a field agent. Agent Smart is naive and inexperienced but not played as a fool. He is not the silly, idiotic agent that Don Adams wonderfully portrayed. Steve Carell's Smart is not a fool, just new, inexperienced, clumsy and naive.Don Adams was hilarious as Smart, who was anything but smart. He'd say, ""Would you believe this building is surrounded by 100 Control agents?"" When told his foe found that hard to believe, Adams' Smart systematically reduced the threat to something like ""Would you believe 3 boys scouts and a guard dog?"" And he would say it with such earnestness that it made clear just how foolish he was, actually thinking he could change his story and still hope to be believed. When Carell's Smart pulls the same gag, it feels totally out of character. His Smart is no fool and would never say such an idiotic thing. So it makes no sense, other than the writers wanting to get in a gag from the series while changing the lead character so that the gag no longer makes sense.The movie includes the cone of silence but, frankly, it was done much funnier in the series. There are brief scenes showing Hymie the robot, the red car, and the phone booth. But that's just to remind us that this is the Get Smart movie.The series was laugh-out-loud funny about a goofy, stupid agent against stupid enemies. It was a wonderful farce spoofing the secret agent genre. The movie is a mildly amusing story about an inexperienced agent. It missed the mark by a million miles. If you want to laugh out loud, watch the old series and forget the movie.",Get Smart

I love Steve Carell. One of my favourite actors. I really Anne Hathaway. I even like The Rock, but what I saw of this movie was just so disappointing and dull. I am currently prepping to write my midterm exam, and thought I'd take a study break. You know, watch a good movie, unwind. I'd rather study than finish watching this. Maybe I'll finish watching it as punishment if I do poorly on my midterm!
I gave this 3 stars because it is dull, boring, uninspired and lacks the magic of the original, but this is only meant to reflect the portion of the movie I watched.

264,Aldud7,Get smart,7,10 July 2011,"So yeah I watched it the other day. Get smart is the story of undercover agency. Steve Carell playes Max the guy who works at the agency and wants became an agent but his boss won't promote him because he's too good at the job he's already does. But here, on the horizon, rises another mission and the boss changes his mind. Here Max is introduced to the agent 99 who's pro and she doesn't want him to be her partner because he's unexperienced. And here it all really starts. Steve Carell is amazing as usual. But I wanted to watch this movie because of Anne Hatheway as it was announced that she's gonna play Catwoman in The dark knight rises. And I can say that she's the best chose for Catwoman. She can be really funny at the moment, can be serious. So yeah that's that. Now the most important part - the humor. Yeah it has it and a lot.

265,naun,Niceness instead of evil,8,22 June 2008,"The new Get Smart movie is not exactly a resurrection of the old TV series. While Steve Carell is a passable doppelganger for Don Adams, nothing much remains of the other characters except the names. We see Max's original car and shoe phone and a few other props in a CONTROL museum (which creates a weird sense of displacement -- if this is Max, who drove the old car?), and there's a cameo by a well-known present-day actor which, for a blissful moment, takes us back to the style and mood of the original. But for the rest, it's a completely new show. And once you get over the initial disorientation, you can see the sense in that. Nobody can be Bernie Kopell's Siegfried again, or Barbara Feldon's Agent 99, who were in any case products of a more innocent time. Instead, the filmmakers have attempted -- and actually pulled off -- something much trickier: they've taken the spirit of the original and brought it up to date. Like the TV show, the new movie is smart but canny enough not to be too knowing, and it delivers its pratfalls without any trace of meanness. Anne Hathaway's 99 is as sassy as Barbara Feldon's, but is now a career woman trying to find a balance with her personal life. Alan Arkin's Chief is an avuncular old-timer who can barely conceal his contempt for the vice-president, or for the jocks at the CIA. The old TV series was the kind of show where a KAOS ape could fall to his doom by slipping on a banana peel. The new movie's action sequences step up the adrenalin a few notches but don't lose that sense of absurdity. (Airline lavatories are, apparently, still treacherous places to be.) As for Max himself, Steve Carell's incarnation is several degrees more oblique than Don Adams', but like him inhabits a zone that his adversaries only think they can reach. The new weapon in his arsenal is emotional intelligence, and in a 60s-ish touch, our heroes prevail in a few of their battles by making love instead of war. This is a movie that uses its talents for niceness instead of evil.",Get Smart

267,subego,what a wonderful surprise this movie turned out to be!,9,29 June 2009,"I am finding it difficult to put into words how much I enjoyed this film! When I first heard rumblings of this movie being made, I received the word with some skepticism. Just seeing how other remakes turned out...such as ""Bewitched"" ""The Beverly Hillbillys"" and ""The Dukes of Hazard,"" made me cringe, therefore I honestly expected Get Smart to be on par with those titles. In truth, the only reason I went to see is was for Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway. Ultimately, however, the reason this movie resonated not only with me but my fellow movie goers can be summed up in one word; ""Faithfulness."" The films writers stayed faithful to the spirit of the original television series...not only with regards to the level of acting and satire, but more importantly the inherent nature of the characterizations. Maxwell Smart and Agent 99 (not to mention the Chief) were great well defined characters. In the original series, for instance, Max was great simply because, despite his bumbling nature and seeming ineptitude, or perhaps because of it, he still got the job completed. Steve Carell does the portrayal proud...on the one hand being humorously incompetent (the airline bathroom scene) while at the same time assuming the role of the Bond-like super agent,(the train tracks scene,) that he is in his heart of hearts. Anne Hathaway is absolutely perfect as Agent 99! She serves as not only the perfect foil for Max, but as a complimentary experienced missing half to the former desk jockey turned field agent that is Maxwell Smart. Kudos also go to Alan Arkin for his take on the ""Chief."" truth be told, the original Chiefs role in the series was not nearly as well defined as those of the other main cast members. There were great moments to be sure, but in the original show, to me anyway, he seemed more of a long suffering employer who often grew annoyed and exasperated with his agents...but endured the torment because they brought results. Alan Arkins characterization draws more on the physical comedy and less on dialog to tell a story. With few words spoken the viewer still gets the very real sense of the almost fatherly affection that the Chief holds for Max, as well as the unspoken respect and admiration that Max displays for him in return. These moments in the film are a testament to the high level of the physical performance of comedy and drama, carried out with subtle, nuanced skill that few actors can successfully convey.So, to sum up: Great remake of an often overlooked milestone series from televisions history. Unlike other re-imaginings of bygone shows that sorely lack both proper casting and inspired execution, ""Get Smart"" accomplishes both of these important aspects admirably! Again, though, the main reason it all pulls together so nicely for this movie is because of the faithfulness the filmmakers have shown to the subject matter. I would imagine that there was much temptation on the writers part to add their own personal stamp or slant in order to make it their own. But that, unfortunately, does not necessarily make a better movie...as evidenced by the mass of remake failures that litter the cutout bins of every video store. Thankfully, those responsible for this gem resisted that considerable temptation, the result being a simply wonderfully reverent, thoughtful and genuinely funny film!",Get Smart

Anne Hathaway is very good as Agent 99. She has portrays a lot of emotion, and her character plays a pivotal role. Dwanye Johnson as Agent is very good. He is the slick agent who is good looking, and all the ladies stare at. Alan Arkin is incredible as the chief. He brings humor and tension all on the same platter. Terry Crews and Terrance Stamp play the two retard agents who are hilarious. James Caan does a good job as the president, and makes a really good joke about President Bush.The Jokes in the movie were generally appropriate for children. There are two or three jokes that refer to homosexuality, and one part where Carell kisses Johnson. There is also a scene where it looks like Carell is having sex with another man. Most of the perverted jokes will go over kids heads. The movie is generally child friendly. Definitely a good family movie, but be careful about some of the jokes.

271,yocca_98,Brilliant move from TV to film,8,14 June 2009,"Being a fan of Steve Carell, I have always been slightly disappointed with the quality of films he has stared in. Whilst his co-staring roles have been very good (Ron Burgundy, Bruce Almighty) his lead role have been generally quite poor (40 year old virgin excluded) However, in Get Smart he appears to have found the type of role that suits his undoubted comic talents.Get Smart is based on the 60th TV series of the same name and, apparently, pays just enough homage to the original (had to ask my American friend about that as I only had a vague recollection of the TV show.) It is based on the bumbling antics of Maxwell Smart (Steve Carell), a frustrated analyst for CONTROL (a US government spy agency) who is desperate to become an Agent and do battle against KAOS, a terrorist organisation led by the shady character known only as Siegfried (Terrence Stamp) Unfortunately, despite passing his agents exam, Smart is refused promotion due to the Chief of Control (Alan Arkin) insisting his analytical skills are too valuable to the organisation. However, after Controls HQ is attacked and all other agents identity is compromised, Smart is promoted to Agent 86 and, along with Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway) must infiltrate KAOS and thwart their plans to set off numerous nuclear devices worldwide.This leads the two agents to firstly parachute into Eastern Europe, where they attend a party hosted by a member of Kaos. Then onto a bakery and finally back to America where they discover the initial target is a concert hall where the president (James Caan) is due to attend a concert.The plot is nothing special but the action moves along well and is generally well acted. Whilst some of the comedy moments are less than successful - the scene with Agent 13 (Bill Murray) talking to Agent 86 from within his tree costume being one that immediately spring to mind - their are a number of genuine laugh out loud moments that left me with aching sides (Smart trying to remove plastic handcuffs using a dart gun whilst in an aeroplane toilet being my favourite.) The support cast all play their parts and whilst the twist at the end is not a major surprise, you do find yourself routing for Agent 86 The film is not perfect and there are moments where you feel more rigorous editing would have helped. However, I would have no hesitation in recommending it as a enjoyable way to pass 90 minutes and it does show the creators of Jonny English how to do this style of film.

275,redrum_9,Disappointing,4,9 August 2009,"This was one of the few movies of 2008 I was looking forward to. I love the films of Mel Brooks, the man who's behind the original TV series for this movie. I'm also a big fan of 'The Naked Gun' series. I think Steve Carell is a good actor, a funny guy, who could play well (but not as good as Nielsen of course) a Frank Drebin-like character, and I hoped that this film is going to be at last a funny comedy from Hollywood. This wasn't the case.Many, way too many parts of 'Get Smart' were boring. It was clear at times that for a while there hasn't been one joke. To that adds that a lot of the jokes are unfunny to slightly funny, in general weak. The main problem of the film is that it was trying to be an action/spy film and a comedy at the same time, and that it failed. Normally these spy film spoofs like 'The Naked Gun' as mentioned above, have the right balance between suspense/action and comedy. Those 2 are well combined with each other. 'Get Smart' failed to do this balance, it can even be said that action and comedy scenes are sometimes altered. There are sequences of pure action without any comedy, and sequences with pure comedy without any action. You cannot decide which side to lean to, added to which the film doesn't really succeed in neither of the two genres.Now, there are funny jokes in the film, and more than one, but most of them will probably just make you smile.Even though negative points are dominating in this review, my opinion summarised in two words would be: 'Decent Fun'. It's entertaining after all, and it's better than most of the comedies coming out today, which won't even make you smile once. Give it a shot, but don't have high expectations!",Get Smart
276,prodigaljon,Would you believe... pretty good.,7,26 June 2008,"GET SMART is pretty much what you'd expect from a big-budget Hollywood adaptation of the old t.v. series. There's a thin plot that unravels with increasing quickness as the end credits approach, including a plot twist that will be immediately obvious to anybody who realizes that they're watching a movie. There are lots of nods and winks to the old series - the shoe phone, the catchphrase, the cameos from old supporting characters and surviving actors from the original. There are big action sequences and comfortable jokes as the movie tries to be both an action and a comedy (and never really winds up connecting with either).Where SMART separates itself from the STARSKIES and the HUTCHES is in the casting. Steve Carell's Maxwell Smart is a genuinely likable and charismatic character, one who effortlessly fills the movie screen. He's also re-conceived as an analyst with dreams of being an agent, and is therefore a kinder, more competent and less arrogant Maxwell Smart. And one for whom you can't help but root. Add great turns from the supporting cast (including a gorgeous Anne Hathaway segueing into a decidedly non-feminist Barbara Feldon impression by movie's end) and a couple surprisingly effective action sequences......and you have a pretty good time at the movies. Good enough that I wouldn't mind a return engagement with Agent 86. As long as Steve Carell is back in the shoe phone.",Get Smart
277,brimatt2412,A decent movie thanks to Johnson and Arkin,7,25 June 2008,"I was a big fan of the Get Smart television series as a kid, so I was looking forward to this. But if you come in expecting the TV show, you'll be disappointed. As a stand alone movie, its a decent comedy. But give me Don Adams as Maxwell Smart and Barbara Feldon's 99 any day. Thats not saying Steve Carrell and Anne Hathaway aren't watchable because they are. They just pale in comparison to their television show counterparts.Dwayne Johnson and Alan Arkin were the highlights of the movie. Johnson, I was expecting. The role seemed tailor made for him and it was obvious from the previews that he was going to stand out. Arkin, I was surprised at. He was a lot funnier and livelier than I was expecting. The hot-headed aspect of the Chief added a new dimension which suited the movie well. Terence Stamp and Ken Davitian do a decent job as Siegfried and Shtarker respectively (but again, don't hold a candle to originals Bernie Kopell and King Moody), and the cameo by Kopell, was a nice touch, as well as the reference to the line ""Shtarker, this is KAOS, we don't (insert various line/fake sound effect) here"". This movie was fun and decent, but the television show was definitely much better. Hopefully the interest in this movie, will get the uninitiated to check out the television show.",Get Smart
278,YouSeenThat,Missed it by a bloody mile!,4,26 December 2008,"I'd like to inform you that I've decided to review Get Smart as a big screen adaption of the popular television series. Hell, I figure that if you are going to borrow heavily from an existing source, at least expect the obvious comparisons - deep down inside I owe Don Adams, Barbara Feldon and company something resembling a no-holds-barred comparison.Speaking objectively, the 2008 re-envisioning doesn't really deviate too far from that core ethos of Get Smart at least on the surface. The plot is basic: CONTROL headquarters has been destroyed by an explosion, and the identities of all the major field agents becoming compromised, resulting in the newly-promoted Agent 86, Maxwell Smart (Steve Carell) and Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway) teaming-up to thwart a KAOS attempt to kill the President of the United States. Okay, it's not going to win any Oscars for originality, but as I'll happily concede, so far the film still more or less sounds like any regular Get Smart episode. Right?Okay, let's start with the casting/characters. Nearly all of the main characters were there: Maxwell Smart, Agent 99, The Chief, Siegfried, Starker, Larabee  heck, even our robotic friend Hymie pops-up for a cameo. Okay, so far, so good? Negative. I know it's impossible to accurately recast some of these iconic characters down to the smallest detail, and I wouldn't expect them to, but truthfully there were some really odd casting choices, and in some cases, even complete personality-bypasses bestowed. Now I know what you are thinking - you're waiting for me to rip into the two leads, right? Well you'd be wrong. Personally, I had no major issue with the Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway. Carell cops a lot of stick on the Interwebs, but I can't seem to think of another modern comedic actor who could have filled Don Adam's shoes better - any perceived failing on Carell's behalf was really a result of the pathetic material he had to work with. Likewise, Hathaway was an equally decent casting choice for Agent 99 - she's sexy and feisty, and like her male lead, she really was at the mercy of the material. With Carell it was the flat comedic setups, in Hathaway's case it was one of those personality-bypasses I mentioned earlier. For the life of my I don't remember Agent 99 being such a hard-nosed bitch? I'll lay the blame squarely at the feet of the screenwriters for that, shall I? So as you can tell, the leads didn't tick me off, it was more the supporting cast. Let's start with Siegfried (Terrance Stamp). As much as I like Stamp, really, this was an odd choice for the villain. Not only did our limey friend drift in and out of his dodgy German accent at the drop of a hat, but he was sans Siegfried's trademark mustache! You can't have Siegfried without the mo! That's a bloody outrage! I breathe deep, trying to forget all about Siegfried. Suddenly I'm reminded of his henchman, the solid, square-jawed Starker. Maybe it was the forty year hiatus, but somehow our lovable Eastern Bloc meathead has morphed into a short, fat, Middle-Eastern beardo. What the hell! One piece of casting that I did love was James Caan as the President - very George W. Bush! Caan is a legend.At least there was some action, right? Overall the general action setpieces were fine, however the gunfights and hand-to-hand scenes, while well done, were completely out of place in a Get Smart film. Very out of place, like Robocop raising a barn in an Amish community. What do I mean? Well, when I think Get Smart, or generally any other sort of comedy/action spoof, I usually think of slightly drawn-out, almost unbelievable gunfights and asskickings. There was none of that to be seen in this film. I was very surprised (almost impressed) at how sharp and concise the gunfights were - apparently the new Maxwell Smart is a crackshot with a pistol. Forget about torrents of bullets ricocheting around the place, the gunplay was very much of the 'one shot, one kill' mentality - bad guys were dispatched with a slug the second they appeared on the screen. Don't get me wrong, I'd love to see more of this gear in regular action films, but somehow it all felt very out of place in a Get Smart filmOkay... okay... surely there were some laughs? Get Smart is supposed to be a comedy, right? I think I practically lost count of the number of miserably unfunny set-ups or jokes that fell as flat as lead balloon (like the jokes in this review). I chuckled at a couple of jokes, but ultimately most of my laughs from Get Smart came in the form of unintentional stuff-ups. Example: The Chief is flying a small plane through the city and Maxwell Smart is hanging onto the wheel for dear life as he tries to climb back in. The Chief says something like ""Hold on"" and then, wait for it, he proceeds to do a full barrel-roll in the plane, almost shaking Maxwell loose in the process. What the hell? Get Smart failed to hit a home run on any level. As an adaption of the old television series, this effort didn't even come close to capturing the magic of original. As a standalone film, there's really nothing new to bring to the table that Austin Powers or a similar spy spoof hasn't already done before, and probably a lot better.Edited excerpt from: www.youseenthat.com",Get Smart
279,tchockythegreat,"Lacks an identity, but flashes potential",5,5 February 2009,"Is Get Smart a comedic spy caper or an action-packed buddy flick ala Rush Hour? The filmmakers clearly could not decide, and instead attempted to make the movie both. The result is a film that lacks an identity and feels a bit half-baked and in need of a few more re-writes.Steve Carell essentially turns his Michael Scott character from TV's The Office into a comedic secret agent for this movie, and though he really isn't breaking any new comedic ground, he's still the best thing about this movie. Anne Hathaway is surprisingly adept as both an action heroine and a sexy comedic straight woman, and she may have gained the most out of anyone appearing in this film due to this role successfully expanding her repertoire. Her character, however, could have been utilized for laughs a bit more. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Alan Arkin, Masi Oka and Terry Crews all have comparatively limited screen time but generally make the most of it.The film's biggest handicap is its hit-or-miss script, which quite often drags down its actors with jokes that are often eye-rollingly corny and/or unnecessarily lewd. The movie's funniest moments seem to come when the filmmakers take the cuffs off of Carell and Hathaway and allow them to improvise their way through scenes; the two have great spontaneous comedic chemistry together. Unfortunately, those moments are few and far in between.The action scenes are well-shot and fairly entertaining (especially the film's climax), but regardless, this is a perfect example of the film's lack of focus: Get Smart should be more about comedy than action. It almost seems as if the filmmakers spent too much time perfecting the action scenes and not enough time perfecting the comedy and trimming the fat of the script. Maybe this is the biggest reason why the movie felt like it was 10 to 15 minutes too long. Had the writers edited out or retooled just a few more of the really bad jokes in the script, the movie would have been shorter and likely better off for it.Still, there was enough good in this movie to give me hope that the filmmakers learned from their mistakes. When the inevitable sequel comes out in a few years, hopefully the filmmakers will give the script a bit more focus and a definitive tone while limiting the corny jokes, let Carell and Hathaway do more of what they do best, and remember to keep the movie more in tune with the spirit of its source material.",Get Smart

But if you are someone who has watched every episode (perhaps in reruns), you will be in for some extra-special treats. What may appear to be a minor distraction to the casual fan will bring back nostalgic memories to the devout loyalist.Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway are perfectly cast. So much so that I can't imagine who their second choices would have been. Had Carell declined the role, the movie should not have been made - he's that perfect. Hathaway is beautiful and tough, and perfectly reminiscent of Barbara Feldon.But one final note for Mr. Carell: remember Evan Almighty ... and do NOT make a sequel.

I only went because I had a screening pass, but I was pleasantly surprised. There was a lot more to it than Carrell falling all over the place. In fact, what I liked about it was that he wasn't a bumbling idiot like Clouseau - he was in fact a very good fighter and a very intelligent agent - he happened to have some goof-ups along the way, but it would always be followed with a very smart moment, not a dumb-luck save, or an ""always have to be saved by the girl"" save. The other characters brought a lot to the table as well. Terence Stamp had some of the best lines in the movie, as did Alan Arkin (in fact, my two biggest laughs came from each of them). The action was decent - better than you'd expect from a comedy. Hathaway handled her physical role very well - reminded me of some of Jennifer Garner's better moments in ALIAS. The only real weak link for me was the story between Max and 99. The age difference really stands out, and while they actually address that in the storyline, it still just didn't work for me from a romantic angle. However, their verbal sparring was very well done in the first half of the film. All in all, I was pleasantly surprised. I don't know how much of the enjoyment came from being with a sold-out audience, because I felt free to laugh my booty off since everyone else was, and that kind of fun is contagious. Seeing it alone or with a very small crowd might change the entire tone. I'd say your best bet is to see it Friday or Saturday night with a full audience.",Get Smart

Also, I think there are a lot of people who expect that you must have adult themes, sex and raunchy material to make something funny. This show was just plain fun. Brooks influence on the script as a consultant must have helped a lot. After seeing remake losers like Bewitched and Pink Panther I was also cautious but I got over it fast.Being a fan of the original series, I loved this movie. My kids, who know nothing of the original, loved this movie on its own merits. The audience was belly laughing throughout the movie.Carell really earns top marks for making 86 his own. Hathaway showed a remarkable flexibility and again, made 99 her own. Even incidental material like Heime, which was not necessary to the movie, managed to fit in and was funny. Come on you negative reviewers, name ONE place where the plot stalled, where the references didn't work, where the jokes were not perfectly timed. You cannot.

I laughed almost the whole movie as did the audience I was in. Steve Carell is maturing into a better actor and I thoroughly enjoyed his portrayal as well as that of the whole cast.

As I said they can  be commended for not trying to recreate the original characters, but  this is the problem.

292,stef_nijssen,"Great Laugh Movie, Carrel Is Hilarious",8,7 September 2008,"With loads of action, quirky humor, jazzy music, and shoe phones, Get Smart has admirably mimicked the blend of genres and innovations that made the original series so memorable, and while die-hard fans will likely pick apart what this re-envisioning doesn't get right, it's almost impossible not to laugh at Steve Carell's ludicrous on screen antics.Over-analyzing analyst Maxwell Smart (Steve Carell) dreams of becoming an official Agent for the top secret government organization CONTROL, and longs to execute action-packed spy missions like his idol, the charismatic Agent 23 (Dwayne Johnson). When CONTROL headquarters is attacked by longtime nemesis group KAOS and many of the Agents' identities are compromised, Smart is promoted to Agent 86 and partners with the unwilling Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway) to thwart the villainous group's latest plan for world domination.Whether or not Steve Carell perfectly embodies Maxwell Smart, he certainly knows how to handle his comedy. Excelling at both physical and verbal-stemmed laughs, Carell makes the tumbles look as easy as his notable style of quick quips and clever observations, and the funnyman seems to garner chortles even when the rest of the crew can't quite muster an equal energy. Anne Hathaway provides the good looks and serious attitude to counter Agent 86's incessant jokes, and the pair's on screen chemistry gels nicely throughout the majority of the film. A few slips and failed retorts interrupt the flow of their characters' progressions, but are quickly forgotten in the grand scheme. Alan Arkin furnishes several of the funniest moments in the movie and the Academy Award-winning actor never misses a beat when the camera turns his way. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson again confirms his status as a reliable comedic presence and laudably supports the leads. Many interesting cameos perforate the film, and while they're amusingly recognizable, they're also regrettably wasted. Few draw laughs with clever dialogue or comedic prowess, but rather produce a quick smile for those that get the reference or enjoy the recognition.The humor throughout Get Smart always orbits around Carell and his singular style of comedy. Those that don't take a liking to his brand of wit will undoubtedly be less amused, as he is clearly the driving force behind the vast majority of the entertainment value present. While Carell's lines are rarely delivered without a magnetic humor, many of the conversations lose their luster midway, due to faltering dialogue and a lack of focus on creating the biggest laughs. Several of the extravagant set-pieces end with many a missed opportunity to supply more hilarity, and lots of little laughs spread the truly uproarious moments too thin. While a healthy dose of romance, drama, and some truly spectacular action scenes appears commendable, the devotion to these components often shortchanges the comedy.From exotic locales to storm drains, and Moscow to Disney Hall, the action and humor follows Maxwell Smart at breakneck speed. A few feeble gags and missed chances at grand hilarity can't ruin the fun; and while they might have ""missed it by just that much,"" it's not enough to detract from Carell's dynamic performance and the inspired comedy that trails closely behind.",Get Smart
293,FredKrueger10,Getting smarter as it goes along,9,14 July 2008,"Get Smart is one of bestest television adaptations I've seen...in ages. Many critics have mixed this and I don't know why, it might have more action but it is blended with the hilarious humour, if there was too much humour, it would be The Pink Panther. Most fans gave positive reviews because of how it turned out. CHARACTERS: As most of the characters are all here from the TV show, the most funniest character would be, of course, Maxwell Smart, played brilliantly by Steve Carell. Most characters are fair but dry like Siegfield and The Chief. CAST: As this features an all-cast, it is well cast. DIALOGUE: The dialogue was good, some pieces are abit of a disappointment though but what do you expect. BEGINNING: This gives a good inside look at the characters except for Siegfield which were rushed within minutes, however it maintains pace. MIDDLE: During this sequence, we are taken to different parts of the world uncovering CHAOS and Seigfield creating nuclear weapons. ENDING: The ending is fairly long but it is fast-paced with non-stop action. But as it reaches it's ending, it seemed awfully rushed. DIRECTOR: Peter Segal was good at directing. Et al.Get Smart is one of those 'hard to come-by' adaptations of a TV series. It is well-paced and gives us a good laugh when we need it.

The humor was very well done, and the characterizations were also very good (with the exception of Zigfreid)! I was worried that they were going to radically change the premise of the Maxwell Smart character, however the film makers kept the character quite true to the Don Adams portrayal. The story did a good job of holding your attention, and the humor was timely and worked well.

295,MuchTooDutch,Didn't Miss By Much,9,19 August 2008,"By Bryce VanKooten I can't decide if I like Steve Carell (Maxwell Smart) more when he is silent or when he is talking. Either way he's a master. Up until about a year ago, I was unsure if he could do anything besides scream with a straight face, although I won't lie, whether it was newscast gibberish or Kelly Clarkson expletivesI laughed every time. It wasn't until his role in Little Miss Sunshine that I really appreciated his acting skills and thus, more fully understood the broad range of talent. Still, Get Smart is not about acting; it's about popcorn. Plain and simplygreat laughs, solid entertainment, fun for all the cousins.Carell delivers once again in this altered, but still very friendly adaptation of Mel Brooks and Buck Henry's classic mid-1960s TV series, which starred the late, great Don Adams as super-spy Maxwell Smart, a.k.a. Agent 86. For many, Adams will forever be the true Agent 86, and if you see the movie and can't get over that, I understand, but nonetheless Get Smart, the movie, brings Mel Brooks kind of humor to a new generationfamilies included.Obviously an Oscar-worthy movie (let alone the performancegeez, nominate the guy), it's clear that Carell was born to play this role. Very rarely (and before recent missteps, Will Ferrell seemed to be reaching this plateau) is an actor or actress so brilliantly comedic that they can simply stand on a stage, saying nothing, and get laughs. Think back to the days of Carol Burnett. Or even Bob Hope doing the Oscars. Both comic giants, at ease in any situationthe audience overwhelmed with their charm. I would like to think that this aura is simply 'comedic charm', but more eloquently, it is probably closer to 'comedic genius'. Not that this movie solely places Steve Carell in comedic lore, but it definitely doesn't hinder his rise. Once again, he holds any scene he's in and has you shifting in your seat, leaning slightly forward as not to miss an off-the-cuff reference or quip. With Anne Hathaway playing the uptight, overbearing feminist and Carell fitting nicely as the blatant nitwit, there's little time left for the gadgets to get laughs, save one.The funniest scene of the entire film takes place in an airplane restroom. Hands tied, seeking freedom from his bonds (seen briefly in the trailer) Maxwell Smart attempts to free himself by using his weapon of choice: a miniature crossbow. Hilarity ensues, as aiming the bow with his mouth becomes something of a nightmare and the plane's metallic surroundings causing unintended physics. Refusing defeat after the first couple misfires; this scene builds as we watch the entire sheath unloaded, one painful shot at a time. This sequence alone is worth the price of admission and combined with an obese waltz during a fancy gala, your cheeks will likely have had enough hilarity.Now, don't get me wrong, there is plenty of robust corny comedy throughout the movie; more specificallyanything that happens in the Control hallway, but outside of faltered gags (which may be eliminatedI saw 6-months early test screening), the movie flows well. Alan Arkin is superb as the Chief and Borat's own Ken Davitian (Shtarker) brings normalcy to the utterly ridiculousthis guy would have been at home in any Mel Brooks ensemble. The other actors, although working well in the flow of the film, rarely hit homerun jokes. From the 'Silent Force Field' to the rooftop fight sequence, one thing is true: no question, Steve Carell is funny. His timing and his flair for Death-Valley-dry under-acting make him a perfect 86, with the entire film serving as testament to his on-screen charismanot to mention, he fits a suit better than most. Get Smart is a breath of fresh, classic air in a time of raunch-fest comedies like Semi Pro, and the upcoming and completely worthless Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Dare I say, ""Best Comedy of the Year""? Ah, missed it by that much.",Get Smart

It was instantly my favorite funny movie since the first time I watched it. Steve Carell is my favorite comedy actor ever, and it really does show in this movie. All the other actors did a fantastic job with the movie, it is one that will keep you laughing no matter how many times you watch it! Try it! The movie is really under rated on this site, as with most movies, but do NOT let that stop you from watching this movie. With that said, I hope you enjoy the movie as much as much as I did when I first saw it, and I do still to this day when I watch it every now and then.",Get Smart

299,ayed,surprisingly excellent,9,23 June 2008,"if there's one sure rule in Hollywood it is that recycled TV show remakes are uniformly awful. Think The Dukes of Hazzard (but, the exception that proves the rule, The Addams Family movies were great).Get Smart is of the Addams Family mold -- an update that isn't a tired cash-in relying solely on the goodwill generated by the original. Instead of parroting the original characters (I was soooo happy that Steve Carrel didn't affect a Don Adams voice and spout ""missed it by that much"" every few minutes -- although he did say it once), the Get Smart movie takes the basic structure (bumbling agent 86 paired with sexy and ultra-competent agent 99) of the original and makes something new with it. What really works about the film is that it is truly funny, but also truly an action movie -- without skimping on either.Sure to be the best (and most successful) comedy of the summer, the only competition I see for best summer movie is the new Batman movie. As good as I expect Nolan, Bale (and Gyllenhall! yay, no Katie Holmes!) to be, Get Smart is sure to be more fun.Bottom line: precisely what you want a summer popcorn flick to be, fun and exciting, without the usual IQ-draining effect of 99% of the genre. oh, and Anne Hathaway is sexier and more alluring with her clothes ON than 100 naked bimbos combined.",Get Smart

The film is pretty dry and unfunny as a whole, there really isn't a lot of comedy in it and the little that there is usually falls pretty flat. Plot wise it isn't that compelling and is very predictable. Steve Carell is very good in the movie and tries his best to save the film along with Ann Hathaway, however Terence Stamp is horribly miscast as is Alan Arkin. There are a few good moments such as a dance scene, and the film appears to have some respect for the source material but at the end of the day it's pretty forgettable and just an okay watch.",Get Smart

If you grew up watching Bond movies, you loved the satire in ""Get Smart"". I personally thought they should have used much more of what was memorable from the TV show in the movie, such as catchy phrases and pranks. It seemed to me as if they were afraid to go to far or be to similar to the TV show. The plot seemed typical and there were no memorable moments. It seemed as if the writers were afraid to be funny silly, or they were not that familiar with the TV show. It is a movie you could watch with the kids though.

And while the two belong to different genre, there was no question about which one was more entertaining! Get Smart is about the escapades of Maxwell Smart (Chris Carell), a desk-bound analyst with Control (An intelligence organization with the US Government) who desperately wants to be a field agent, so he could fight the evil forces of the evil organization KAOS, led by unknown forces that threaten to destabilize the world unless their demands are met. Maxwell's boss 'The Chief' (played with surprising alacrity by Alan Arkin) knows Maxwell's good for the role, but doesn't want to lose his best analyst. Agent23 (Dwayne Johnson aka 'The Rock' gets better and better!) is the star field agent who's just come back from a mission, but since a leak in Control has compromised identities, is forced to become a analyst. After an attack by KAOS blows up their HQ, Control is forced to deploy a new agent, and Maxwell finally gets his chance as Agent86, and gets paired with another star agent. Agent99 (Ann Hathway) is openly reserving about Agent86's lack of experience as an agent, but gets to know him better as they chase stolen nuclear weapons,and Uranium yellow-cake thieves in Russia, and fight the evil Siegfried of KAOS, his man-Friday Shtarker and his man-mountain-dean henchman Dalip (WWE superstar 'The Great Khali' making a cameo appearance). It appears there's a conspiracy to assassinate the President, but would the redoubtable duo prove equal to the task against the immense odds involved, particularly when there seems to be a mole in the organization, and loyalties are suspect? Get Smart is a spoof on spy movies, particularly the James Bond series, True Lies and many others, and is hilarious from the word go. More than the slap-stick, the best parts is the dialogue; amazingly funny throughout, it easily brings out the best of humour, while steering clear of being vulgar, or crass. The screenplay is tight, the film's pace never slackens, and the action is well thought-out and quite large-scale. Some of the scenes are unforgettable, particularly the Russian Ball, the plane and the jump thereafter, and the War-Room, which is reminiscent of the Dr. Strangelove. Alan Arkin's 'I've waiting for this since Nixon!' is Gen. Turgidson! Chris Carrel brings out the best of a 'serious' character who's hilarious, see him in 'The 40-year old Virgin', and this one, and you'll see what I mean. The movie's is worth a visit simply for his sake. Ann Hathway provides a superb foil as Agent99, she really should go for more in this genre, as she able to mix the elements of glamour and action quite well! All in all, a 7/10 as movie, and an 8/10 as comedy.",Get Smart

I seriously thought that the movie would just simply be stupid and wouldn't do the series justice, but you know what... it was a good movie!They added much more depth to 99, which I love! Now she isn't just the brain of the partnership who gets Max out of trouble, she is also someone with a background and a story. Overall, I found this movie to be funny with great action, with great visual effects, with great acting, with wonderful jokes and with a great ending! I honestly couldn't have asked for more! I recommend this movie to anyone. Even if you haven't seen the TV series, you should still see the movie just because it's a great comedy all on its own. One negative thing I have is that, even though they used a lot of Max's and 99's catchphrases from the show, they forgot about the (as an example) ""Max: Don't tell me I fell off the horse. 99: You fell off the horse Max. Max: I asked you not to tell me that!"" catchphrase. That one always got to me as a kid and I didn't hear it in the movie. :-/Nevertheless, it's still a great comedy! :D",Get Smart
305,Computer_Stud,A Movie Adaptation That I Enjoyed,7,5 January 2009,"I had my doubts when I learned that they were making a new Get Smart movie because I always worry about how new writers are going to handle a classic TV show. But I must say that I was very impressed with this movie, which had the right balance of paying homage to the original series and providing enough updates to satisfy the younger generation.Steve Carell takes on the late Don Adams' famous role as Maxwell Smart (aka Agent 86), a secret agent who works for the good guy organization CONTROL that tries to put a stop to enemy forces working for KAOS. Alongside Max is his partner in fighting crime Agent 99, played by Anne Hathaway (filling the shoes of the lovely Barbara Feldon). As Head of CONTROL, Alan Arkin plays Chief, who is constantly exasperated by the clumsy attempts of Max to solve the latest case.There is not much of a plot that goes beyond any of the episodes found in the original TV show, but I do like how the screenwriters handled old material. There are some nuances in writing Max as an analyst-turned-spy (the original Max was a spy from the start) but that doesn't take away from Carell's ability to play Smart the way Adams did. In the original series, Max was bumbling and dumb at times but he wasn't always that way and was resourceful enough to get the job done. This aspect of Max is not lost in the movie. Carell's version of Max is a little more book smart, but he still has that goofy yet competent persona leaving him at one moment ineptly utilizing the newest gadget but in the next instance subduing a KAOS agent through a combination of cleverness and physical strength. Carell successfully brings Maxwell Smart to life on screen without having to do an exact copy of Don Adams. The character of 99 is also updated into a hardcore butt-kicking agent (Feldon's 99 was tough but in a more toned-down way). Nevertheless, Hathaway still brings warmth and sensitivity to the character of 99. She doesn't fawn over Max the way Feldon's version did, but her attraction to Smart is still obvious to the viewer. Despite the big age gap between the two actors, Carell and Hathaway are believable when the story calls for romance. Along with their brilliant acting and strong chemistry comes many references to the TV show and some of the funniest scenes and wordplay that could only have been influenced by Mel Brooks.Also, expect to find some other great performances by the supporting actors, especially Alan Arkin as Chief, who does the role justice the way the late Edward Platt did and an equally great performance by The Rock, who continues to prove his ability to entertain audiences on the big screen. Fans of the TV show will not be disappointed and a newer audience will grow to love Get Smart.",Get Smart

I enjoyed the old show, and had kinda wanted to see it too, so I forked out. We both truly enjoyed it. Actually, we both had a blast.2) Why do so few of these reviews comment on the action sequences? They're right up there with the Bond flicks! The plane? The train? C'mon! Believable? No. Kick ass? You betcha! The production values of this film totally blast past expectations.One thing: 1) At least twice, Smart gets to say his trademark ""Missed it by *thaat* much!"" line. But, the film doesn't give noobies the hints/help they need for this. There should have been -- very early early in the film -- a scene that was totally plagiarized from the series... A classic ""Missed it by *thaat* much!"" scene... so the new crowd could get into that alongside us old-crowd folks.One other thing: 1) Carell is perfect for the part. But he should have put a little effort into the voice.... The nasal quality of Don Adams' Smart's voice was -- I think -- one of the defining aspects of the character. Seemed like Carell totally ignored this.Still... a well done fun film. I'm glad I spent the money to activate it on pay-per-view.",Get Smart

310,damoskees,Can't understand all the negative reviews,10,1 September 2013,"I feel obliged to make a review, just to offset all the critics awarding one star, and saying all the positive reviews are studio stooges. I'm nothing of the sort, and I loved this movie.I've also never seen the original series - maybe I saw a re-run at some point - so I have no reference point. It's tough to make a contemporary film that is popular with the purists, and if this missed it, fair enough.Watching the movie right now, I think the aspects I loved about it are that it is generally a fun movie, and the comic bickering. Whether it be between Agent 86 (Steve Carell's Max) and Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway), or Agent 23 and Larabee - there's a continual jibing dialogue laced with dry sarcasm, often quickly descending to a petty level at odds with the supposed importance of the situation. Verbal combat interspersed with gems like ""The cone's the shizzle"" or ""Oh look, a box of kittens, I'll punch Max in the face"", make this movie.I enjoyed this movie as much as I enjoyed Airplane, The Naked Gun, and Austin Powers. Those are also spoofs of genres of films, and they're generally accepted to have worked - perhaps making a remake of a spoof is harder?Combined with some well-judged slapstick, again reducing these top-tier operatives to a group of children - this is a fun, enjoyable movie. It exudes a warmth that makes me like to think that the cast had fun making it, but even if they didn't, I had fun watching it.",Get Smart

After Evan Almighty, pressure was on Steve Carrell to deliver a good movie. So, did he make a comedy worthy of your money, or is this another flop like Evan Almighty?Maxwell Smart(Carell) is an analyst for the spy group CONTROL. After pressure is put on CONTROL to put down the evil organization known as KAOS, Maxwell is promoted to the rank of agent. His partner is Agent 99(Hathaway) a much better and experienced agent. The two agents must sort out their differences and bring down KAOS until it's too late. Get Smart has mediocre character development. Maxwell is a decent lead character, as we know some about his background and personality. Agent 99 is also a decent romantic interest, as she avoids being the perfect girl. The supporting characters are where the movie goes wrong. Siegfried(Stamp) is nothing more than a bad guy that's all evil and has no redeemable qualities. The other bad guys are equally underdeveloped, with the exception of the big guy. The Chief(Arkin) has OK development, and the rest of the agents are underdeveloped. Get Smart provides laughs, but the story is actually quite terrible. We have our one dimensional bad guys who want to blow up the world, and that's as far as the plot goes. The journey of Smart and Agent 99 has a lot of laughs, especially in one scene where Smart tries to use a mini harpoon gun, and keeps hitting himself. Other funny scenes include a dance off and the journey through a sewer. Get Smart has a terrible ending. It seems way too easily resolved, and everything ends up too perfect. There was one good laugh in it, but that was it for the ending. Get Smart has bad settings. There's nothing special about them. The headquarters for CONTROL aren't cool the least bit, and the headquarters for KOAS aren't the least bit menacing. The rest of the settings are just your average plane, sewer, building, etc. Get Smart has bad directing. He doesn't create any kind of atmosphere in the movie. We never get a feeling for the settings, since he doesn't use the right shots. The lighting is bland. The music in Get Smart is OK. It doesn't add anything to the movie, but it never screws up. The same goes for the sound editing. The acting in Get Smart is equal to the character development. Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway give good performances as the lead characters. They know quite a bit about comedic timing, and they have good chemistry together. There is a useless cameo by Bill Murray. All of the supporting actors give bad performances. Alan Arkin's performance during the ending is terrible. I almost thought that he wanted Maxwell to die because he should've evoked a sense of emergency, but sleep acts in his performance. Overall, Terence Stamp gave the worst performance as Siegfried. So, I still haven't seen a good Steve Carell movie after The 40 Year Old Virgin. Get Smart is better than Evan Almighty, but that isn't saying much. On an artistic level, Get Smart has only one good thing going for it which is the leads. Get Smart does have a decent amount of laughs though, so that does save it some. BAKED FRESH BOTTOM LINE 4/10Pros: Lead characters and actors Has a decent amount of good jokes.

(even agent 13 makes an appearance, and you'll be shocked to see who plays him if you haven't already heard) I had really low expectations for the movie, but it was better than I expected. It's no Iron Man, but for what it is, a goofball comedy, it messures up. Plenty of gags. Steve Carrell is perfectly cast as Maxwell Smart. My biggest complaint is that Carrells take is too smart. (and not as in Maxwell Smart). The Don Adams character was a bumbling idiot that lucked into anything he did that had a good outcome. Carrell's Smart is way more competent. Ann Hathaway as 99 is gorgeous. I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about her character. The previews made it appear that she was some sort of superchick agent ala Tomb Raider or something. But watching the movie, she doesn't come off like that. Still not a direct interpretation of the classic agent 99. Alan Arkin as the chief is also very well cast. But in this movie, agent 86 isn't the thorn in his side as in the TV show. One thing missing was Max's apartment. With all of its weird booby traps and gizmos. I was really hoping to see that, but was sadly lacking. The movie was pretty good, but could have been so much better. Oh, wrestling fans will recognize The Great Kalli (sp) the 7 foot plus giant, as a KAOS henchman. Best henchman since Richard Keal as Jaws in the old Bond movies from the 70's and 80's.

In all honesty, I laughed twice, and they weren't specifically about the movie itself, just the reference to ABBA's ""Take A Chance on Me"" on the iPod and Steve Carell's cute bum. I really wanted to give this movie a chance to succeed, but it just didn't.I went to see this movie on the first day of opening in Australia nationally. The cinema was half-full and hardly anyone laughed for the entire duration of the film. The silence in the cinema was surreal.The relationship between Agents 86 and 99 is appalling; 99 spends more time on-screen abusing and insulting 86 and there is absolutely no chemistry until the predictable end scenes and even that didn't work for them!There were many irritating characters as well; in fact, all of them! I'm not knocking the actors playing the roles, but Agent 23, Siegfried, the Chief, Larabee, Bruce, Lloyd, Dalip, etc, were just simply annoying characters.The final appearance of Patrick Warburton's 'Hymie' was the only saving grace character and he was only on-screen for less than a minute.I couldn't wait for this film to end, especially after seeing what was a brilliant concept of ""Get Smart"" re-written so badly in the 'updated' version.

The movie is full of clichés, there are few laughs (if any), no suspense, no thrill, and little action. The only reason to see this movie would be if you loved the Get Smart TV show and feel nostalgic about it.Steve Carrels stars as an intelligence analysts, turned field agent who has found some terrorist ""chatter"" and goes on after the terrorists as a companion to Anne Hathaways's character Agent 99. Anne Hathaway stars as the seasoned Agent 99. Anne is good looking and acts well, but I don't think she comes out as ""tough"". Hathaway's looks, and Carrell's goofs, are what the director's saw as selling point and probably fired the script writers. Even though Hathaway looks good, unfortunately (for the viewer) Steve Carrell's goofs are well below average. There is not much to say about the plot twists, because there aren't any. I am surprised that some reviewers added spoiler alert to their reviews. There is nothing to spoil the suspense. Five minutes into the movie, you can predict what will happen (and it WILL happen).

Just about every agent and character from the original series is here, from Agent 13 who gets stuffed in the oddest places to Fang, Max's dog from season one. The dialog, the gags, and the characters are pure Get Smart. I do not believe anyone could have come into Don Adams shoe phone better than Steve Carell. He perfectly carries off the almost debonair, yet not as clever as he thinks he is Agent 86. Anne Hathaway (who looks breathtaking in black leather) was awesome as Agent 99, completely playing the seasoned agent to Max's bumbling.

Sadly, I didn't have enough money to go buy a drink at the concessions stand each time a gag was rolled out during the course of Get Smart.The gags just weren't in the least funny, each being dragged out and whipped, like the scene with the tiny crossbow (or whatever it was), which just went on and on and on.Now, some like embarrassing humour. I'm not one of them. So in fairness, I can't be too critical of that in and of itself, but I can be critical of just how much of it there was.I laughed deliberately once and that was when Smart vomited into a bag while in the jet, only to have the contents splurge out everywhere, so that's one star.The whole feel of the movie was exceptionally juvenile, and I can almost hear the actors whispering to themselves, and perhaps each other ""Just keep thinking of the damned pay cheque and swallow it down!""So why two stars?

The performances were all good, actually, but the story was dumb and the toilet humor wasn't necessary. The Rock and Great Khali were fine and Terrence Stamp is super. I loved him in Wanted, which I saw yesterday, and I loved him here. But he's usually the same guy. He'll never top Superman II, of course.Anyway, I hate movies about Russians set in Russia. Always have, and my streak has not yet been broken. Ronin, The Saint, and I'm sure there are more... I hate it!And before you say Indiana Jones IV, I will remind you it was set mostly in the jungle. So there.",Get Smart
323,steven-j-ellis,Misses the target,4,15 September 2008,"I grew up on Get Smart - I still love watching it. The movie just misses the target. Sure, it has all the old gags but they seem to be almost thrown in blatantly in the wrong moments. Steve Carell is very good - a worthy choice to carry on the Don Adams legacy. He carries the movie as I was disappointed with the other regular characters. For seem reason the writers decided to change the qualities and quirks of most of the old cast. Since when was Larabee an obnoxious ass, Siegfried not German, 99 so pretentious and the chief so lifeless? Sigh, we will probably see a sequel that transcends the disappointment of this one but such is the Hollywood way these days.For those who say this movie was really great, go back and watch some of the TV episodes and see how it all stacks up.......",Get Smart
324,imalamin,"Smart, in more ways than one.",8,22 June 2008,"For those that don't know, Get Smart is the Big Screen adaptation of a 1960's TV Series of the same name, which is a spoof of Spy movies, mostly James Bond. It is centered around a CIA-like organization called CONTROL agent, Maxwell Smart and his partner Agent 99 as they try to stop an evil organization, KAOS from taking over the world. Granted I've never watched a single episode of the original TV series, so I'm reviewing this movie as a stand-alone movie. The movie starts off with Smart (Steve Carrel, 40 Year Old Virgin) an analyst in CONTROL desperately wanting to be a field agent, but because he was so good at what he does (Analyzing stuff), the Chief (Alan Arkin, Rendition) refused to promote him. In a twist of fate, there was a security breach and the identities of all the CONTROL agents became known to KAOS, thus the chief had no choice but to promote Smart. Smart was partnered with Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway, The Devil Wears Prada) who thinks he is incompetent and inexperienced. The rest of the movie involves Smart and 99 trying to bring down KAOS while uncovering KAOS's plans, which included assassinating the president of the United States. This movie was very well shot, and it clearly had a budget, because the stunt scenes all looked amazing. The movie has no strong plot, but so does every other parody movie, so it was expected, but the dialog was witty and funny, and I found myself laughing hard through most of it. The casting was perfect. With Steve Carrel and Anne Hathaway as leads, you have other great actors like Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Masi Oka from ""Heroes"" and Terry Crews from ""Everybody Hates Chris"" supporting. I especially like the way they made Smart actually smart, because I am tired of seeing dumb people doing dumb things on the screen just to get a laugh. In Smart's case, he was a smart analyst who was just too inexperienced as a field agent and thus made a lot of silly mistakes which were really funny. Even though I liked almost everything about this movie, there were scenes I felt seemed out of place, and a few special effects weren't so convincing. But all that is just mild criticism because the rest of the awesomeness called ""Get Smart"" is going to blow you away! Get Smart will easily make the cut of my favorite comedies of the year. I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars for everyone.",Get Smart

There are jokes that are a little corny, but there were more jokes that were Hilarious that it made you forget the corny ones. Steve Carell... was at his best! He was as funny as ever!! And Anne... well keep trying because Carell out thundered you! This movie really shows how funny not funny can be! Carell couldn't be as funny! Some of the cast was a little iffy, but it was still a fantabulous movie! and I know it isn't a word, but its so good! I wouldn't use that word for any other movie!

It is nearly impossible. I went into it as skeptical as possible, but couldn't believe how well it turned out. Steve Carell is ideally cast as Maxwell Smart, a bumbling but lovable CONTROL agent who is paired with the unbelievably beautiful Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway) to combat their nemesis, KAOS. I won't reveal any of the jokes, that is part of the fun of watching the movie, but I will say that Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson has one of his best roles, and the same goes for Alan Arkin as The Chief, who has a problem with people not pronouncing words correctly. Also with some hilarious roles (and cameos) are Bill Murray, David Koechner and Terry Crews. Watch the movie and you will not be disappointed.",Get Smart
327,TheSnappySneezer,"Very Poor Remake of Johnny English, not Get Smart",1,1 October 2010,"Pound for pound, ounce for ounce, a dreadful remake of a slightly better film called Johnny English starring Rowan Atkinson. While the title, character names and ads might try to attempt to make you think this is a remake of Get Smart, it has none of the charm or characterizations. It is like they took the US office and put them in the Johnny English film with a bigger budget. IT does not work. It is an insult to fans of Get Smart, comedy films and fans, spy films and fans and even Rowan Atkinson. Carell is OK in other films but fails miserably here, not a funny moment, the office character does not in any way fulfill the character of Maxwell Smart.The real original character of Maxwell Smart is not a low raking agent trying to prove himself and win respect of the girl. He is already the top and most trusted agent because he gets the job done despite his bumbling tactics. 99 is suppose to be blindly devoted to him, hero worship him even, despite her superior knowledge. They got 99 wrong, they got Max wrong, they got everything wrong here. It is a carbon copy of the film Johnny English, they took Maxwell Smart down from the top and put him in the bottom, in the same position, attitude, personality, failings, neediness, lazy daydreamer as Atkinson character. It is a shame, I am not afraid of remakes, I had hopes for this film but the second I heard Carell had the job, I knew it would be the Office meet Johnny English. I was right, hooray I guess... I hope, as time goes by when people remember Get Smart, they will not remember this dud but rather the classic series with Don Adams and Barbara Feldon.",Get Smart
328,Lebowlski,Not quite that funny,5,20 October 2008,"When i went to see this movie i expected a funny cheerful james bond like movie. Instead i got a dreadful and tedious movie that couldn't hold my attention beyond the hour.First of all, i didn't see it through, so maybe the funny parts were still to come and i'm judging too soon...but thats also the reason i didn't rate it any lower then a 5. Second of all, it's too bad Leslie Nielson is getting too old for these kinda films and Charlie Sheen has other stuff to do. Overall, the acting wasn't that good...kinda plain actually (I really liked him in The Office, but this...) The story took too long to develop and it just wasn't funny!! Give me the old naked gun and i'll be laughing my bottom off! The things i liked? The Rock was kinda OK, though he should've sticked to the scorpion king type of movie. I liked the nerdy 'Hiro' (from the series Heroes) and occasionally there was a funny joke (""there are bad guys, but that's what they are, not who they are""). And i liked the james bond style, though more 'marvel-action-cartoonlike' theme music. and of course i loved the chick (but then again...who wouldn't!)",Get Smart

330,myo39,Get Smart? Get Real.,6,2 July 2008,"I never got a chance to see the original Get Smart. From the trailers I really had no intention to see it, but I caved and saw it. Upon leaving I thought that Get Smart was not to bad of a movie. I mean, to be real, it wasn't good either. But my expectations for it weren't set high to begin with and I found it to be enjoyable.Steve Carell and Ann Hathaway both do very good jobs as Smart and Agent 99. They had some great teamwork and it was funny to see how there relationship changed throughout the movie. Granted I didn't find this movie to be hysterical, but the jokes were not as dumb as Zohan.Get Smart also had the right amount of action. I truly enjoyed the final scene where Smart was hanging from an airplane banner to the fight in the car were the undercover bad guy is revealed.To conclude, I would recommend seeing Get Smart. I can understand why some people would hate it or give it low scores. It probably does deserve one, but for me, I had a good experience with it so I would give it a 6. If you like Steve, and liked the original show, I think you would truly enjoy this movie.",Get Smart
331,NexusFields,Max Almighty,1,29 April 2008,"""Get Smart"" is a classic for a reason. It combined great writing, 60's zeitgeist and a truly iconic star performance from Don Adams as Agent 86 to create one of the most beloved, as well as influential, comedies of all time. Repeated attempts to revive the blueprint, both as theatrical films, TV movies and a 90's Fox series starring Andy Dick all missed the mark. (In fact, the ""Smart"" formula was more successfully revived by other franchises like ""Sledge Hammer,"" ""The Naked Gun"" and ""Austin Powers."") This new theatrical film is the first time another performer has ever played Maxwell Smart. It will also be the last, as this lackluster big screen outing sadly misses the key ingredients that made the original show so great. Much of the humor is obvious, derivative and devoid of satirical bite. ""Get Smart"" in its day was the equivalent of ""The Daily Show,"" while this movie comes off as a generic, big budget spy comedy with large action scenes and scant real guffaws. I smiled a few times, but never laughed out loud. The frenzied finale featured solid stunts which livened up the proceedings, but not enough to save what preceded it. As far as the romance between the two leads, the age difference made for a major miscalculation. The original Max and 99 has a charm and innocence where this literally felt smarmy. The whole thing felt much closer to the last couple of ""Rush Hour"" flicks than ""Get Smart,"" with a simplistic plot that doesn't involve the viewer, a fatally wooden Anne Hathaway and the gifted Steve Carell channeling more Mr. Bean than Don Adams. He becomes grating in the role. Mr. Carell is such a wonderful performer but, like the late Dudley Moore, he's squandering his potential in the wrong vehicles. He should stop trying to fill the shoes (or shoe phones) of Gervais, Carrey, Adams and stay the course of ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" and ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and stay away from remakes.",Get Smart

333,jlpitzen,"Ow, my funny bone - that smarts!",8,28 June 2008,"Certain movies throw me a curve ball, and all the analysis in the world can't explain why I enjoy a seemingly average movie so much. ""Get Smart"" is such a movie, and it tickled my funny bone something fierce. Most of the low-brow gags and bumbling moves of agent Maxwell Smart are perfectly timed and seem very fresh, even though most of the comedy bits have been done before. A great cast complements the wonderful central performance of Steve Carell, who achieves a superb balance of doofus, skilled agent, and likable guy. The comedy is the main draw, but also expect some exciting action sequences. The plot is a generic post-Cold War nuclear bomb caper in which the good guys have to stop the bad guys from setting off a nuclear bomb. Maxwell Smart is an information analyst for a secret government agency called CONTROL. When CONTROL headquarters is bombed and their computers are hacked, the identities of their agents become compromised. So Max is promoted to an agent and partnered with Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway), who recently had facial reconstructive surgery. Max and 99 travel to Russia to thwart the plans for world domination of KAOS head Siegfried (Terence Stamp). The comedy gags aren't particularly original, and yet I laughed my ass off. My guess is that the cause of so many direct hits to my funny bone is great comedy timing in general, and the specific kind of skill Steve Carrell has perfected in combining the two personas of bumbling fool and nice guy. Also, I think the element of surprise contributed to the comedy - even though the gags weren't novel, they still managed to catch me off-guard and be unexpected. Carell has some great support in the form of Alan Arkin as CONTROL Chief, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as Agent 23, and a blissful cameo by Bill Murray. Anne Hathaway provides some tough attitude opposite Carrell's nice guy, and she adds a pleasant dose of sex appeal. ""Get Smart"" is no ""Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery"" (""Get Smart"" adapts multiple ""AP"" gags - a pissing scene, grunting and groaning in the bathroom for non-defecatory reasons, a character in a fat suit, and the development of the observation that faceless henchmen actually have personal lives), but I was entertained way more than I expected to be. The bottom line is that ""Get Smart"" produced more laugh-out-loud moments than any movie in recent memory, and some blockbuster action scenes are an added bonus. 8/10",Get Smart
334,Belle-Et-La-B,Get Smart couldn't Get Funny.,1,27 June 2008,"I have never seen the original show but I have heard of it and I always heard it was supposed to be witty.... That DEFINITELY was not this movie! This movie was filled with pathetic dialogue you could TELL they thought would be funny that nobody laughed at, lame attempts at physical humor (Scary Movie 4 did it better!), and unpleasant moments with Steve Carell (what is up with him being so smug in his movies now? Who finds that funny?). And the weird thing is I feel that people might feel like they were SUPPOSED to like this movie. I've had to see it twice and in both showings there weren't that many laugh moments and yet I hear people leaving say how much they loved it! It's like, ""Where you watching another movie on your ipod too?"" Another bad thing about this movie was it's a bad spy adventure. It seemed like they put HALF the thought into the adventure part they put into the jokes (and it shouldn't even be POSSIBLE to put that little thought into something!). It's just the average ""evil"" organization who's rarely seen throughout the entire movie has taken some nuclear weapons and is planning on holding the world hostage for a large sum of money. Well guess how predictably it ENDS! The only positives of this movie are the performances of Alan Arkin (who has THE funniest line in the movie), Dwayne Johnson (who had his funny line deleted in favor of an unfunny line from Terry Crews) and Anne Hathaway, who proves to be ten times funnier and more enjoyable than Steve Carell thinks he is. For your sake, go find a comedy that is ACTUALLY funny! (My advice is to stay away from Steve Carell!)",Get Smart

I am personally tired with ""comedies"" (if you can call them comedies) that refer to sex in an attempt to be funny. ""Get Smart"" had none of that, it felt like an actual comedy. If you watched some James Bond movies you will appreciate the humour much more though.I have not seen the TV Series that people are constantly referring to, and I still thought this movie was hilarious. It is probably the best comedy of past few years. It also has plenty of action to keep things well balanced and entertaining.If you are tired of movies like ""Meet the Spartans"" and 'epic movies' then this movie is for you. This movie also has no explicit drug or sex references, which means you will have a great time watching it with your family.8.5/10 Enjoy.",Get Smart
336,cicciobello3,Don't waste your time!,3,1 January 2009,"This movie doesn't absolutely respect the original idea of Smart. The real, original agent smart is totally different. He, the original, almost always didn't know what he is doing, or the consequences of his actions. In this ""movie"" the character is almost the opposite. Sometimes the movie seems like a serious spy movie (but in this is not believable) sometimes it seems simply stupid. Even 99 is totally different from the original. Only who haven't see the original series could look at this film. The others, better for them if they don't waste time. Agent Smart series was a kind of joke of real spy movies. It's simply absurd to try to make a movie that is a joke of another joke!!",Get Smart

Smart's shoe phone, and all of the familiar one-liners are present. Carell is perfect as Smart. Hathaway's comic ability keeps up with Carell. Johnson has a good screen presence. Filling up the cast list, Arkin and James Caan are great.Trevor Rabin does fine work with the music.

338,Moviefanguy,Nudnik Shpilkes,8,21 November 2008,"Overall I think this was a good movie. Carrell had a difficult task in that Don Adams's portrayal of Smart was iconic. I think he did a good job of not merely imitating it. Briefly seeing Smart's old cars in order, first the Sunbeam Tiger, then an Opel GT, and finally a Karmann Ghia was a nice homage to the original series. And did anyone catch the name on the airplane, Yarmy Airways? Don Yarmy was Don Adams's real name.One of the funniest lines I have ever heard in a movie is when Max enters KAOS headquarters saying ""My name...is Nudnik Shpilkes."" And I'll let you get out the Yiddish dictionary for that one.",Get Smart
339,KleePongPictures,"Hilarious, kinda takes your mind off the plot",7,25 January 2010,"I wanted to watch Get Smart ever since I saw the trailer where it shows Max having a hard time opening the door in the phone booth. As usual, I waited for the DVD to come out. The first thing that stood out in my mind was the main character Steve Carrell. The movie starts with hilarious moments after 5 minutes. After that, every few minutes there would be something funny. However, there were too many funny parts that blinded me from seeing the plot.Overall, this movie is enjoyable and is worth watching a second time just to enjoy the humor again.Go watch it because it's worth watching 7/10",Get Smart
340,ZinusMero,I was dubious but pleasantly surprised.,9,30 April 2009,"Growing up on the Don Adams original i was very doubtful about this movie. I love the original series and the only expectation i had of this movie was that it can't possibly live up to the original. I was surprised, this movie is hilarious and it seems to only get better each time i watch it. I have seen it at least 3 or 4 times and every time i still laugh at the same things. The casting of Steve Carell as Max was a master stroke, i don't know that anyone else could have pulled it off. Also Patrick Warburton as Hymie, seriously, no one else could have done it as well. The reason i give this movie only 7 is because of the inappropriate use or mis-timed use of certain lines. Especially the line ""Oh Max"" that 99 says several times throughout the movie. In the original series, she would say it after Max does or says something dopey and it fit, but Anne Hathaway's use of this line just didn't fit with what was happening. I really hope there is a sequel and that Hymie is brought more into it. Spin off: There has already been a spin off movie, Bruce and Lloyd: Out of Control which features the two tech guys. It runs in the same time line as the Get Smart movie and has a cameo appearance by 99. Hymie was also featured and although not there for long was hilarious. It wasn't a bad movie but at just over 60 minutes was too short.",Get Smart
341,dgoodh,Worst Movie of the Year... no doubt,1,27 June 2008,"Maxwell Smart is an analyst with the covert secret agency CONTROL. Max is very good at his job, but now yearns to be an agent in the field. After passing the tests that he needs to in order to advance, the arch forces of the enemy agency KAOS threaten to strike in a devastating way. Now it's up to Max to find out for sure what is being done and to stop them.And that's a very loose description of the premise to Get Smart, a movie updating and re-imagining of the classic comedy TV series from the 1960s...... and the new winner to the title of ""Worst Movie Of The Year,"" and here it is, I thought it was going to take some time before something could take that title away from M. Night Shyamalan's The Happening and yet this movie does so with ease.This is supposed to be a comedy and yet, I didn't laugh at a thing in the film and so right there it fails and fails miserably. Even when this is relying on some of the old chestnuts from the original series (with one notable exception), this just fails.And the reason for that failure is on two counts- it's ill-conceived as a movie, and the character of Maxwell Smart has been seriously compromised.Now, y'see, back when the show was on, it was genuinely funny and being the brainchild of comedy legends Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, you'd expect it to be. The TV series was a spoof of spy movies, it was a low budget and very small show, and yet it was loaded with big, but two-dimensional characters, and the biggest of them all was Maxwell Smart. And it was also ridiculously rapid-fire with it's jokes and gags. And also, I loved the original series, I think it was one of the all-time greats in television comedy.Here... here, director Peter Segal gets it entirely wrong. First, this is trying to be an action movie with lots of comedic overtones, and it's also very big, especially in consideration of it's source, and the biggest thing that they do wrong in the midst of all of that is that they try to make you think it's real, and that was never the spirit of the original show by any means.The second thing that they get wrong is in the character of Maxwell Smart. Now Don Adams was a genius and he knew just how Smart was to be played. Smart was the GREATEST secret agent in the world, especially in his own mind, even if he screwed up more often than not, but above all he was extremely confident. Here, they've turned Maxwell Smart into the most politically correct weenie on the planet, and there's some small part of me that can't help but wonder if this is in some way partly due to Steve Carell and what he's been doing in some of his other movies lately. This Maxwell Smart's main drive is to understand that his enemies in the world are people first and if you get to know the person, you then find the weakness, but his way of getting to the weakness is with compassion more than anything else...... oh for cryin' out loud...This movie is nearly two hours long, and that's because it's trying to be an action movie and it's pacing itself that way, and when it throws in it's gags, it just falls flat and even worse than that... boring.Now there is plenty here for the Get Smart TV series fan, lots of bits and sight gags, and every now and then, Carell well spout out one of the lines that Max used in the day and because of the change that they made with Smart himself, that line just feels like Steve Carell saying the line by rote and little else.On paper, Steve Carell should be perfect for the part... that is if he would be willing to play something just as two-dimensional as what Maxwell Smart was (and even moreso if the movie would've been willing to go that route- this movie is looking at Mission: Impossible when it should be looking at Airplane! or Blazing Saddles), but here, he just seems like amateur night or what you'd get if Michael Scott (his character from The Office) was trying to act. Anne Hathaway plays Smart's partner, Agent 99, and first off, she just looks fantastic and also looks like she would have a real affinity with being in a legitimate action film, it's just too bad that she's in this one. And her character has been changed as well, in particularly to be a little more shrewish than anything else.Get Smart is as ill-conceived as a TV-to-movie adaptation/remake/re-imagining can get and even though it tries to have some echoes of the original series, those echoes fall flat due to a poor conception of the film and a dramatically ill-conceived new interpretation of it's lead character. As such, you have a comedy here that's just not funny on virtually any level (with the one exception) and if a comedy isn't funny then it's a bad movie, and this one is just about as bad as it gets. About a half hour before this ended, I was just about ready to ask the other four people I was with if anyone wanted to leave (none of us were enjoying this), but we stood through it all the way until it's incredibly sappy end... oh I wish we had, but then I couldn't pass on this cautionary review on to you...Right now... Get Smart is the worst movie of the year, period.",Get Smart

This movie is hilarious...There are nods and expected jokes from the old series amongst a very cleverly rework of Control vs Kaos... Carell brings his brand of humor and lays it over the essence of Don Adams and some flavors of Mel Brooks. Expect some cameos from the series and Get Smart fans...I saw this movie on DVD but should have seen it in the cinema as it has some big action in it as well...Whether your new to Get Smart or know the old series, in my opinion you can't go wrong with this flick...Hopefully we'll get a sequel as good as this and another era of Maxwell Smart.",Get Smart

345,rogconklin,I now forgive Steve Carell for Evan Almighty,9,29 June 2008,"I loved the original Get Smart!, especially the slapstick humor that only Mel Brooks/Buck Henry could bring. But this adaptation is even funnier than the TV show. Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway make perfect CONTROL agents 86 and 99. Even though you knew that they were supposed to get together, the way the writers built the story of how they were assigned as partners and how their relationship grew is great. Dwayne Johnson as Agent 23 is also fantastic. Playing to his strengths as a cocky, swaggering, super agent is priceless. And Max does get the shoe phone back, along with his Sunbeam convertible.Keep watch out for Bernie Koppel, Sigfried from the original.Well worth the money and time!",Get Smart
346,gmh701,Get Smart and see this movie!,9,21 June 2008,"I was extremely excited about this movie ever since I saw the first preview. And although I can't say I'm a fan of the show...because I haven't seen a single episode, I still had high expectations for it. I walked into the theater excited, and walked out ecstatic and deeply satisfied. This is definitely one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long, long time; I haven't felt this satisfied with a movie since...I don't know when! The gags and jokes were, for the most part, original; ones I haven't seen before. (Of course, there is the classic ""gets hit in the groin"" gag.) Besides from some unnecessary crude humor, this movie had me in stitches the entire time! Steve Carell plays such a good nerdy character (and I mean that in the best way possible) that I would nominate him for an Oscar if I could.(Okay, maybe he's not THAT good.)But seriously, this is the best movie I've seen all summer. Indiana Jones has nothing on this excellent film! The only minor flaw with this movie is its predictability. The plot was like a gigantic building: you could see it coming for miles. Fortunately, the building wasn't a drab old concrete skyscraper, but a colorful, 50-story toy company headquarters. You know what to expect, but when you eventually get to it, the reward is nonetheless immensely entertaining and one of the best ways to spend and hour and 30 minutes of your life. My final thoughts about Get Smart are that it is one of the best comedy movies I've seen in a long, long time. (I haven't seen ""You Don't Mess With the Zohan"" yet, however). The action sequences, surprisingly, are very well done and are better than the sequences in some action movies! Even if you aren't a longtime fan of the original 60's TV show, you will have a fantastically fun time at the theaters; drop everything you're doing and see this movie. It is well worth the price of admission...but I'm not sure about gas. Is any movie worth that much? And although it is definitely not one of the best overall movies I've seen, in the comedy genre, it is a masterpiece. I applaud everyone who was involved with it. In short, I LOVED THIS MOVIE! Get Smart is work of comedic genius. 10/10(P.S: This movie will not make you smarter, despite the title. Any scientific studies you might have read about are completely 100% false. Although your IQ won't increase, you're sure to have a blast!)",Get Smart
347,scorcher86,Surprisingly hilarious movie with great supporting cast,8,22 June 2008,"I just got back from watching Get Smart, and I was pleasantly surprised with the movie. Anne Hathaway and Steve Carrell worked very well together, they complemented each other greatly and their on screen chemistry was an added bonus to the movie.I didn't know much about the original Get Smart TV show going into the movie, but I definitely loved Steve Carrell's portrayal of the character. His clumsiness in some respects, and professional manner in others really was hilarious to watch when it came together in different situations.Also, Agent 23 played by the Rock, the Chief played by Alan Arkin, and the supporting hit-man, CONTROL techs, and other agents were really great additions to the movie. Although, their characters weren't highly developed throughout the course of the movie, they provided great comic relief adding to the already hilarious situations that Max Smart and Agent 99 got themselves into.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie because it was much funnier than I expected, their was a good amount of action surprisingly, and the chemistry between Steve Carrell and Anne Hathaway was great. The only drawback I had about the movie was that the story line was a bit confusing at first for their mission, but it becomes clearer as the movie progresses. Otherwise, this movie was a hilarious feel good comedy different from typical dry comedies, and very reminiscent of a clean comedy like M.A.S.H.",Get Smart
348,samwzhang,not for non-fans of the TV series,5,12 November 2008,"Wow I can't believe the comments I've read so far. Ratings are either ten or one? I've just finished the movie and my guess is that the ones rating this movie ""10"" are die-hard ""get smart the TV show"" fans and the ""1"" raters are trying to pull the ratings way down.In truth, this is one mediocre comedy that probably does not deserve a ""7"" rating as it stands (the reason I watched it). There are so many unfunny jokes, so little originality. I barely watched the 60' show so I don't recognize too many related jokes and I have a feeling the writer might have relied too much on the TV-show clichés to win over crowd. Is it effective? Not if the crowd consists mainly of none-fans of the 60's TV show.If you've barely watched the TV-show, expect this movie to provide occasional chuckle, some good action and long period of lameness.Rating 5/10",Get Smart
349,i_love_movies-1,Adults find it funny; Teens won't,6,22 June 2008,"I went to the movies with a group of about 7 friends(six actually, one went to the wrong theater). We had gone to see either The Love Guru or Get Smart. After some argument we settled for Get Smart, thinking it would be a night full of laughs. Is was not at all. Maxwell Smart, Agent 86 works for secret organization CONTROL. He is on a mission to battle the forces of their evil crime nemesis known as KAOS with his beautiful partner Agent 99, at his side. When the headquarters of U.S. spy agency Control is attacked and the identities of its agents compromised, the Chief has no choice but to promote his ever-eager analyst Maxwell Smart, who has always dreams of working in the field alongside stalwart superstar Agent 23. Smart will do whatever it takes to thwart the latest plot for world domination by KAOS. I remember laughing 2 during the whole movie, while all the adults in the theater wouldn't shut up. If it weren't for the action i'd have left the theater, especially when the song Four Minutes began playing. To sum things up, the acting was great, story was OK, acting was good and music was.....#@%&! The movie is watchable but for teens...barely.",Get Smart
350,farrenlinda@hotmail.com,I agree,2,11 June 2008,"I agree.I never write these things but this movie was SUCH a disappointment. Steve Carell said he didn't want to do an imitation of Don Adams, so instead he has basically NO character. the movie is NOT funny, Smart isn't even really inept. It can't decide what kind of movie it wants to be, the villain is like a real villain, whereas in the show, Sigfried was as bumbling as Smart. There are a few chuckles in references to the old series, but mostly it falls flat. just like most movies these days a lot of money and effects on the screen, no substance!If you want to see a really great performance by Steve Carell, see ""Dan in Real Life"". he was excellent and the movie is very entertaining.",Get Smart

It was fun to see this movie and remember things from the TV series. Steve Carrell and Anne Hathaway are a great pair where the chemistry holds them together. Alan Arkin played the Chrif perfectly, Dwayne Johnson was a convincing Agent 23 and Patrick Warburton was a nice surprise as Hymie.Go, sit back, enjoy and share some laughs.",Get Smart

Well, as you can see, there are several sides of people who comment this movie. A side which said that the ones who watched the TV series already and suggest everyone to watch the movie, another side which said that it is very bad for the TV Series' lover to watch this movie because it is disappointing. But for me, the one who just watched the movie without knowing anything about the TV series would like to suggest anyone, from any sides of viewer to watch this wonderful movie! I may not know a lot of the actors or the actress, but everybody works and acts really good. I mean, like Steve Carell (hopefully I write the right one), to say the truth, I quite dislike his act because of his emotionless face in other movies I've watched, but, in this movie, I think he really act his best and I am laughing all the way from the start through the end by his classic jokes. I don't really know why. Then, Dwayne Johnson, I think he act good enough to fool the viewer that he is with CONTROL. And at last Anne Heatheway, OMG, she is gorgeous, and suit her role as the main lady. And all of them play their roles harmonically, they can connect with each other by all means! As I've said, that I've watched this several times, it's true. I've never get bored by watching the hilarious, touching, and the cool parts of the movie. There is no, not at all, the depressing part of the movie that I dislike. Every part is well, great, and beautifully done to attract everyone who wants to watch this movie.Oh, this is the most wonderful movie I've ever seen that not at all make me bored, and I can watch it hundreds times straight, if I have the time to watch for sure.Last words, I really encourage everyone to watch this movie.

353,garyhuxdon,Having control over chaos,8,21 June 2008,"I know that. This is a weird title for such a review.Get Smart was, first of all, one of the top movies in my summer list. I am not disappointed about that now. It's pretty obvious that Carell really knew what to do to pass expectations. Not just Carell, but the cast.Aside the comedy, science fiction fans will also get a little taste of what they want. A spy spoof would not be puzzled together without gadgets, just like James Bond movies, the like.Rarely does the laughs, goof-offs and jokes miss what they are aiming for. Really. The fight sequences get a remix with them, an amazing remix. Punch, kick, joke, the sequence goes on and on.Get Smart will be also memorable with its chase scene in Los Angeles. The sequence I just gave you will give a hint.Let's leave it like this: Get Smart is truly a good TV-to-movie adaptation, though I have never seen an episode of the TV show. I won't lie about this next one: it is also an unforgettable spy spoof. It's war with The Love Guru will surely be over with Get Smart victorious and a smile on your face.",Get Smart

356,webtecht,Wow was it really that good.**May Contain Spoilers*,3,2 January 2009,"Three of the comedies I was looking forward to seeing this year was Get Smart, The Love Guru, and Don't Mess With The Zohan. Of the three this movie receives the second lowest rating of the three from me. First of all how anyone viewing this movie(and I don't care if original creator Mel Brooks loved it)could compare it favorably to the original TV show. Steve Carrell's Performance seemed rushed as did the whole movie. Hey lets quickly squeeze in a bunch of ""smartisms"" so we can throw in a bunch of ""hollywood"" action stunts. Of course lets leave a ton of open ended comments/situations so we can do sequel. It was so obvious that a sequel will be in the offering in the future that this movie felt like a 90 minute commercial for the next big Hollywood comedy franchise. Most of the performances were very shallow and not very engaging. Anne Hathaway's 99 was extremely unlikable throughout, as the original 99 had a soft but strong smoldering sensuality. Something that was completely missing. The setup of getting Smart out of a desk job and into the field as an active agent used up the first 20 minutes of the movie and frankly was very boring. I think I maybe laughed out loud maybe three times and chuckled a few more throughout this flat rendition of a TV show that was pure comedic genius. And oh by the way Mr.Brooks endorsement of this movie is purely business as co creator of the original he stands to gain a lot if the movie was successful. So for all those reviewers that site that Brooks loved it ,think about it. I don't particularly recommend this movie , a bit flat not that funny. the well done hype bigger than the finished product.",Get Smart
357,SilverChris,Sequel worthy,9,26 June 2008,"I am old enough to remember watching the original on TV. I was a big fan. For me, Steve Carell's work can be great sometimes and sometimes just okay. This one I thought hit right on the mark. The entire cast was great. Ann Hathaway has a future in bigger action movies if she decides to pursue that route, and I think this movie will help elevate her career towards the A-listers if she isn't already there. Steve Carell's agent 86 was at least as good as Don Adam's if not better, and I think that is saying a lot! I think the big difference here is that Carell's 86 isn't a complete moron. He makes goofy mistakes but he also comes through with a few impressive moves here and there too. It helps to make it more believable that he would actually be an agent. Not that you need to really believe in what's happening to enjoy the movie. The movie has action, fun and heart. I would definitely recommend this to a friend and I would go see it again myself. I was entertained throughout. If/When a sequel comes out, (and I bet there will be one...) I would go see it.",Get Smart

I only watched 15-20 minutes of the movie before walking out, so it's possible that I missed all the good stuff, but somehow I don't recall anything funny in what I actually saw. A smug guy walking into a wall? How original. A person being bumped into by another person on the street, then by another one, and complaining about that? Wow, I did not see that coming. 'Eggs falling out of uterus'? Finally something not seen in 14,586 other films and run-of-the-mill sitcoms, if out-of-nowhere crass, but funny? Yikes.. (And the preceding conversation about Anne Hathaway's character being older than she looks: was it supposed to be funny, and why was it there at all?) I hoped that Bill Murray in the tree would be a good scene, but the cameo just fizzled out on its single, painfully predictable note. I went to see 'Get smart' for Steve Carell, but saw the Steve Carell of 'Evan Almighty', only way more bland and ordinary - a far cry from the 'man of intensity' of 'The Office'.",Get Smart
359,kmr_jy,"Hilarious from start to finish! Absolute fun film, money worth spending!",9,25 June 2008,After long time I have laughed so hard in this movie. Steve is brilliant in this movie from start to finish. He carries the weight of comedy in this movie all on his shoulder. Absolutely loved this movie since it asks you to leave your thinking cap behind at home and come enjoy the movie. It's good clean humor. I have been tired of all the movies that recently came out trying to make people laugh using sex and private parts as tools in a comedy. The plot and the story has no merit in this movie as it is a repeat of a storyline that has been used in Hollywood movies way too many times before both in comedy and drama. The reason this movie is awesome is because of the comic timings and the chemistry between Anne's character and Steve's character. I would absolutely recommend you to go watch this movie with your family or significant others as it is great fun and enjoyable. This movie will be super hit!,Get Smart
360,nowshowingtv,"""Get Smart"" is funny!",9,17 June 2008,"I have to disagree with everyone who says the film isn't funny. I'm a fan of the original series, and I can say that the film holds its own while never letting us forget the original. The audience at my screening were laughing so loudly most of the time that I missed a lot of dialog. Carrell is perfectly cast as Smart, and Arkin and Johnson give good performances as well. It did take a while to warm up to Anne Hathaway because she was just too abrasive towards Max for the first half of the film. Also wasted was Terrence Stamp. They really didn't give Seigfried enough to do. It was cool to see Bernie Koppel though in a cameo (but where were Barbara Feldon and Dick Gauthier?). I liked the two nerdy guys who were like Bond's Q (squared!), and overall I thought the film was extremely well done and didn't suck the life out of the room like ""Bewitched"" did. I think the movie ""Get Smart"" can co-exist very well with the classic TV series. If you want to see a bad ""Get Smart"" film, check out ""The Nude Bomb,"" which reunited Adams and Feldon on the big screen. Even worse, check out the Fox re-boot TV series with Andy Dick as Max and 99's son (they had twins on the classic show which was never addressed on that show!). ""Get Smart"" is much, much better than ""Bewitched,"" ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" and ""Speed Racer"" combined!",Get Smart

362,lyonbrave-25159,Watch Austin Powers Instead If You Want A Funny Spy Movie,4,4 August 2019,"Get Smart is a spy movie or an action thriller with an all star cast. This movie has everyone in it. There is so much star power in this movie that people will end up watching the film just because one of their favorite stars is in it, if a second one was made. I mean the Rock has a huge fan base. Everyone loves the Rock, Steve Carell and the lovely Anne Hathaway have a huge fan base. This movie even has the strong and funny Terry Crews and the bald and funny, David Koechner. This movie even has the old and legendary Bill Murray, but a second film was never made, even though it was discussed, because the first film was lame.Considering this movie is overflowing with talent, seasoned actors and actresses, big Hollywood names, guys known for their comedic sensebilities and other guys known for their fighting skills and muscles, this movie is just okay. This movie is not awesome. This movie is not worth watching twice. This movie is nobodies favorite movie and that is a problem when you bring together such an all star cast. The world had high expectations for the film and when it failed to deliver, nobody wanted to waste their money or their time on a sequel.Get Smart came out in 2008. It was rumored that Steve Carell liked playing the role of Max so much he wrote a second script for the film.Inspite the indenible charm of Carell and Hathaway, the storyline was not engaging enough, not to feel bored during the movie. If the first movie is boring to watch, there is no need for a scond one. It's not really a mystery why nobody wanted a second Get Smart other than pretty much Peter Segal. The movie just was not worth the budget or the talent it attracted.This was perhaps not the fault of the actors who were casted as they both have the charisma and shine needed for the big screen. The failure of this movie is likely due to mediocre writing. At the end of the day, a weak script equals a weak film, no matter who you get to star in it. It's like they decided okay we have all these A list stars, and we are just rehashing an old TV show, so we do not need to think too hard about the script, let's just put people in suits, give them guns and start shooting.One reason this movie sucks, is becuase it's not Austin Powers. When a spy movie tries to be funny, it's trying to be Austin Powers and nobody can do it better than the spy who shagged me baby.
Becuase this movie tried to be funny and humorous, but didn't really make you laugh hard at any moments, other than a flash back to Carell's charachter being at fat camp, this movie was a bust. Nothing was too good about it other than you could tell they had a a decent budget and an amazing cast. Unfortunately, what went wrong with the A list cast, was proabbly that the writing was so B list movie. Honestly, Carell probably could have wrote a better script and maybe he could try to get this project off the ground again in the future.",Get Smart

It was one of my favorite shows as a kid.I've been disappointed with many Classic TV show re-makes, so I expected to be, at most, mildly amused watching this movie. I was wrong. I really loved this movie. The movie had many of the TV series elements (shoe phone, phrases, etc.) and it was enjoyable to see these. I was expecting this 'trip down memory lane' and nothing more. But, for me, this movie was more than that.There's lots of action and comedy that can be enjoyed by anyone. Some of the action scenes reminded me of an 'Indiana Jones' movie with more humor.No blood or gore, no swearing and no overt sexual situations. You can watch this with your kids.It's very funny.

It would be interesting to see him in a different role.I don't know why it was found necessary to use the ""S"" word several times in this family movie.

It had none of the charm or subversive humor that made the original series such fun to watch.There is a certain feeling of bait-and-switch when watching this film. The audience was expecting an updated version of the classic Get Smart series, but instead got a very clichéd, very bad action movie with the Get Smart name taken as its title. It is obvious that the screenwriters and director of this mess of a film had no appreciation for the original series. The trademark characters (Maxwell Smart, 99, Siegfried, Larrabee, etc.) as portrayed in the film were nothing like their counterparts from the original series. The characters of Maxwell Smart and 99 were especially miscast. Only in a movie as misguided as this one could Steve Carrell be cast in the role of an action hero. Worse yet, the age difference between Steve Carrell (mid 40s) and Anne Hathaway (early 20s) made the romance storyline particularly creepy.",Get Smart

But not as much as I would have had I not seen the previous classic Get Smart movies and series. This Get Smart movie was NOTHING at all like the originals. At all. Sure, they had the same names and numbers. That would be about it. Sadly. They tried to integrate the old inventive gadgets. They did alright. But they got everything else wrong.Here's the blinding stuff not like the originals (if you even care): Agent 99 falls in love with Maxwell the first time she sees him. They always get along and 99 always follows Max.Laraby is always stupid, but Max's friend. Not his antagonistic tormentor.The Chief always trusts Max and knows that even while he's a klutz, he always comes through.Smart...jeez, got just about everything off. He was never an analyst before he was an agent. He was/is their top agent. He was never fat. They don't give him his witty one liners either...gonna miss those.As a movie, great.

Granted, it wasn't solely supposed to be a comedy, that is why i gave it a 2 because if it were a comedy it would have received 0 stars. Those two stars are present because of the effort put forth from the action scenes. Is it a crime to go into a movie and expect it to be better than 'Pluto Nash' (as a comedy), heck 'Schindler's List' had more laughs in it than this did. The point being, if you go to this movie expecting to be laughing your butt off, then you also better be under the age of 10.

373,paulhmontag,"Oh brother, how 'bout another ...",2,25 June 2008,"Get Smart made me laugh a few times, maybe more ... but it was a really stupid movie if ...... you like storytelling. What's frustrating about a movie like this is that it feels like 100% effort was put into the production elements, special effects and making sure there was a joke for everyone in various target market age groups to enjoy; but why did this movie matter so little? There was no emphasis on story or characters, really.And the filmmakers and producers and executive producers and their friends and cousins, basically, the baker's dozen or so people it felt like directed this movie, made it easy to feel irritated as a film-goer because they go for actual emotional appeal during some moments, like when Steve Carrell and Hathaway are supposed to have a romance or in the beginning of the movie when Steve Carrell is supposed to gain our pity because he's always looked over. Well, if you're going to pull those kinds of scenes, you need to do something, anything, to get you to care about the characters. Why is a comedy like Caddyshack way better than a movie like Get Smart? It's because of the time and development put into the story and characters. I guess I'm still a sucker in that I'm hopeful they make them like they used to.

She don't find this kind of humor funny, it is something special that not all people understand, but that scene jumps from dark to cheesy humor (which almost everyone understand).So all in all, a good movie for a calm night at the TV - Not cinema potential at all though.",Get Smart

379,sleaktower,Watch the trailer instead.,5,19 June 2008,"This is just about as alright as it gets. There is only a little more than what the trailer offered. Steve Carell's straight-faced comedy does keep things just about engaging. But the main problem with the movie is that it's as predictable as Paris Hilton. The twist towards the end is something you may even guess on the way to the theater. I haven't seen the TV show so can't compare.There was a surprising amount of action though. Steve Carell does what he does best. His character reminded me a lot of Steve from 'The Office'. But he really better get out of this Ben Stiller mode for his own good. Hathaway was easy on the eyes. HEr Character again is something we've seen in the past. Rock was good in whatever little he had. Khali was interesting, very caricature-like character, as a matter of fact, all of them were.There is actually nothing more to write about. It'll be funny for guys who haven't seen these kind of movies before.5/10 And that's a generous 5/10, because i like carell.I liked Austin Powers better.",Get Smart

Well I guess I was there too with my daughter who is thirteen years old. I don't consider ourselves imbeciles though we did consume inordinate amounts of pop corn. Did we enjoy it? Well I heard my daughter laugh a number of times and she didn't seem as fidgety as the time I made her watch the classic Casablanca. Being an old foggy I didn't laugh much as I find Mel Brooks' humour a bit too obvious but I did used to enjoy the old Get Smart series on TV, though sporadically. I guess the whole thing is a one idea joke, that is the bumbling Agent with the Smarter female partner in the espionage environment of the old cold war world. In this respect the movie delivers albeit under the stress of a poor script. But really, couldn't they skip the tiring action scenes? I sat through it once and hope to 'get smart' and skip it next time. (sorry for the corn)",Get Smart
381,ufquack,"Get Smart was funny, this is not Get Smart.",3,26 May 2013,"To sum up my thoughts: This movie sets up okay for a Get Smart at the start, and then dragged on to nowhere from there. I kept wanting it to end even though I knew the runtime was 110 min, this movie shouldn't have been over 90 minutes! Here's the problem, jokes weren't sprinkled evenly enough throughout and the ones that are there are only fair, most of this movie could be chopped and dropped. That said, and of what remains, the movie does not maintain the spirit of Get Smart, nor did it have any of the great characters of the original. They absolutely passed off a version of Siegfried that wouldn't even count for a castrated version of the original, and the Alan Arkin is ANNOYING as the Chief, contrast this to Edward Platt's Chief who is simply awesome! In fact none of these actors could compare to the originals. And Steve Carrell is certainly no Don Adams! The direction veered off from the mood of Get Smart and onto an action movie and also had cinematic shots of irrelevant scenery in the style of a James Bond movie. And then there's Dwayne Johnson being a part of it, well if Get Smart fans wanted those things, why wouldn't they just opt to see an action movie instead?",Get Smart
382,reinis-cinitis,"If you're a die-hard fan of the Original series, you won't like it.",7,20 August 2008,"First I want to say that there is almost nothing from the original TV series, only the character names. Max's and the Chief's relationship is nothing like it was in the TV show. Max's character is way different of the one in the series. The old jokes don't work. Siegfried is not Siegfried and I wish that they could have used Bernie Kopell would have played Siegfried again, after that Cameo it seemed that he could do it. I'm angry that the original creators of the TV Show, pure comic geniuses- Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, didn't have almost any saying in the movie. The thing I didn't like the most was Larabee, in the series he was way different. But.....if you're not a big fan of the series, you will enjoy the movie. The cast is incredible. Steve Carrell was a great fit, too bad that he acted like in all of his films. Anne Hatheway was great, but could have been better with a better script. Alan Arkin was great. What's his name the Rock was also good. Terrence Stamp, didn't seem like he studied the Character of Sigfried. Even the series fans will Enjoy Agent 13 and Bernie Kopell's cameo. The film was entertaining, fun to watch. Maybe they should get a better director and then it will be better for both fans and non-fans of the TV series.7/10 because I'm a Get Smart TV series fan.",Get Smart

The cast is not entirly well known, but the on-screen chemistry works so well it feels like they have worked together foreverSteve Carell and Anne Hathaway work very well together. The whole age thing is really a non- issue with the backstory they give Agent 99.

I always thought the first 15 minutes of a comedy were supposed to be the part that reeled in the audience but the only thing that got reeled in was an old boot. If I don't so much as crack a smile during the early part of a comedy, then chances of that improving are not very likely.

When Sigfried says an example has to be made, in reference to a nuclear bomb, I said ""Please let it be this theatre!"" Don't waste your time. Not even worth a free rental! And where did they get these shills to fill the comments section on IMDb? I can't believe that anyone who has ever seen the original series enjoyed this stinker. Steve Carell is not a physical comedian. If they removed the ""comedy"" and made it a straight action movie, it could pass. What the heck was the purpose of the dance scene? Also, the fat jokes and references were tasteless. This movie never missed a chance to go for the lowest common denominator and scenes just ended, it seemed, as if no one thought them through.

389,Calhoun24,Get Smart: Did Not Miss It By That Much,8,20 June 2008,"I've seen some film remakes from television shows. (For the sake of argument, movies like the Star Trek franchise, the original 60's Batman movie, or The X-Files do not apply, since they are more like extensions of their respective series.) There have been good ones, such as The Untouchables, Mission: Impossible III, The Fugitive, or Charlie's Angels, and there have been bad ones, like The Dukes of Hazzard and numerous others I'd rather not mention. Thank heavens that this remake falls more on the former than the latter.I'll be truthful that it's a summer movie, and does not make any notion that it is anything else but that. However, I found myself being drawn in and just enjoying the movie. And it would be a crime to state that everyone in the film was trying to channel the actor that previously played said character. Good thing this was not the case. Each actor does their own spin of the iconic characters. Steve Carell is perfect as the new Maxwell Smart, and I have to admit that it was fun to see him do Max while adding his own twists to the role. Other strong showings are turned in by Anne Hathaway as Agent 99 and Adam Arkin as The Chief, with Hathaway playing 99 as an agent that's experienced, but emotionally hurt, and The Chief as an ex-Control agent that still has some tricks up his sleeve. Also, Terrance Stamp plays Sigfriend pretty much close to the vest, and Dwayne Johnson gives a surprisingly good performance as new character Agent 23. Other notables are Nate Torrence and Masi Oka as two of Max's analyst and gadget guru buddies within Control, and David Torrence as Larrabee, making their respectable scenes fun. In addition, the chemistry and the attraction between Carell and Hathaway is there, but it's somewhat downplayed compared to other espionage-rooted couplings.As for the old staples of the series: the Shoe Phone (which written in and used rather nicely), some peripheral characters, some lines indicative of the series, and the ever-unreliable Cone of Silence (in a scene that I really enjoyed), are all in this film. In addition, this movie screams ""homage"" from the word ""Go"". A car or two, references to an enemy, and a few other surprises will satiate the appetite of those familiar with the TV series.If you don't know Get Smart, then you'll be pleasantly surprised, but if you do, then you're in for a treat. However, don't go in there with a mentality that you would use with, say James Bond or Jason Bourne. This is a good spy film in and of itself that just happens to be funny, and in the end, fun.So, in essence, it didn't miss it by that much. If anything, it hit the spot.If you are a fan, I will ask that if you do go, stay for all the credits. No after credit scene, but you'll know why I asked you do that when you see it.",Get Smart
390,mmcinern,A great comedy/action movie,9,17 June 2008,"I had the pleasure of seeing a sneak preview the weekend prior to ""Get Smart""'s release, and I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised!Unlike the critics' reviews that are soon to trickle out, my opinions are not based off a comparison between the movie and the series (I never watched them), but based off the entertainment value of this movie on its own merits.I think ""Get Smart"" is one of Steve Carell's funniest movie's to date. Anne Hathaway and the Rock also deliver strong performances. While comedy is the focus of ""Get Smart"", there are also action elements that distinguish it from other slapstick comedies.I was not sure what to expect walking into this film. However, I can say that the entire audience laughed uproariously throughout the movie, and all 7 people I saw ""Get Smart"" with loved it. It's unfortunate that the few reviews I have read are so focused on a comparison to the series. While this is to be expected, there will plenty of people in the audience who never watched the series, and will simply see ""Get Smart"" because they expect a funny Steve Carell movie. From this expectation, the movie delivers! If you enjoy Steve Carell type comedy and/or his humor in ""The Office"", you will enjoy ""Get Smart"".",Get Smart
391,pboszor,A welcome Summer's laugh fest,8,21 June 2008,"Get Smart is remarkable not so much for what it contains but for what it avoids. Funny movies lately have included a lot of pottie humor, bodily fluids, flatulence and other crudities that seem to please young people of a certain mentality. Get Smart manages to be very funny in subtle ways that don't shout ""Look at me. I'm funny"". Steve Carell's portrayal recalls the efforts of past comic actors like Buster Keaton and Peter Sellers in the Pink Panther movies. He exhibits an earnestness that makes you believe that he believes in what he is doing no matter how ridiculous it may seem. His dance scene could have been offensive to certain people if it were poorly handled but instead is hilarious. Kudos to the director, Peter Segal, for maintaining a sensitivity and awareness that the audience is not always composed of idiots. One scene between Steve Carell and Dwayne Johnson near the end of the movie has the comic brilliance and timing of the classic pie in the face that you knew was coming but laughed at anyway. This is not really an action movie although things do blow up and crashes occur. This is a fine, funny film which we need more of and which people who have never seen the TV series can enjoy.",Get Smart
392,ya_alma_libre,So much fun!!!,10,19 July 2008,"This movie was great!! Its exactly the movie to see if you want an entertaining and engaging summer flick. Carrell was spectacular as Agent 86-I had my worries going in, but he is a very good action hero. AlanArkin is hilarious as the Chief, dry and sarcastic, perfect fit for the role. I was pleasantly surprised by Duane Johnson as well, some of his best acting is in this film. Though sometimes the writing fell a bit short and a couple of the jokes flopped, I LOVED this movie, best comedy I've seen in a long time. The humor is a little crass at times, so its not exactly for the little ones, but this is a great movie to bring your friends too. Can't wait to see it again, definitely recommend, go see this movie!",Get Smart
393,nat_mac42,Brilliantly Satirical,9,11 June 2021,"This movie is absolutely incredible. I think Rotten Tomatoes forgot that this is a comedy and not a spy thriller. This is probably also what viewers were not expecting, hence some of the more negative reviews. However, the movie does have a certain cheesy-ness, but I believe it is intentional. It also displays a good, but not great comparison and contrast between the two different main characters and how they surprise each other. While this has a somewhat high-profile cast, they do a good job of just focusing on the main characters, unlike some other films that contain such groups. Includes more story elements than a typical comedy, such as Anchorman. In other words, they do not use comedy to drive the plot.",Get Smart
394,armybrat_91,"Finally, a movie that is funny and amusing...",10,24 June 2008,"WITHOUT being based totally on crude sexual humor, unlike some i could mention *cough*zohan*cough*.Get Smart was hilarious. Its jokes were clever and original, which is something that most movies lately seem to lack. Steve Carrel was excellent as endearing Max Smart, managing to make all the right mistakes and yet still pull through when it mattered. He fit the role perfectly. Anne Hathaway as Agent 99 was spectacular, with just the right amount of biting (but funny) sarcasm. And at the end, the Chief wound up making some amazing moves for an old guy. I could go on about the Rock and the geeky tech guys and extra agents, but i think you get my drift. The casting was amazing.This movie was worth every penny the over-priced ticket cost. I found myself laughing almost the entire time. It is a fun movie for all ages you won't regret.",Get Smart
395,awesomemoviefan101,Nothing like the original but still good,6,20 June 2008,"The movie is nothing like the original. Sigfreid is nothing like that in the original. He has a sense of humor in the original. Also Larabee was nothing like himself with his buddy. Kaos is also darker than in the original and with all the new equipment and technology in the movie it really doesn't have much of a connection to the original TV show. Kaos usually is always out witted in a funny and accidental way in the original but with this movie it is more serious and has more action. Also, i mean who is agent 23???? In the TV show they only really focused on 86, 99, chief, Larabee, and sometimes on other agents and people that were there for a few episodes like HIMEE the robot and Harry Hoo.This movie though makes a funny movie, not the best, but something nice to watch when you are bored or just want to watch a funny movie. It brings back some memories of the old Get Smart but really doesn't bring them back clearly as it is to futuristic and its jokes are much more updated and serious.I feel it was OK.",Get Smart

I have to admit, though, I found this movie to be most unbearable. The actor portraying Maxwell Smart is anything but funny. In fact, throughout the movie, I found myself wondering how in the world Agent 99 was putting up with him. I thought Anne Hathaway's portrayal of Agent 99 was quite credible. She seems to like the comedy genre, but I think it would be nice to see her in a serious lead role. As she is really very talented. I found it most unbelievable that Agent 99 would ever date Agent 86 the way he was portrayed. Strangling him would be the most plausible reaction. Anyway, to sum things up, the movie is not funny, but rather irritating. And it isn't worth the time to see it.",Get Smart

I saw the movie in Manhattan and there's nothing tougher than a New York audience, and the whole room was dying laughing throughout the film. I don't know what church group these nay-sayers saw the film with, but it is hilarious.Steve Carell is at his best. He is incredible as Maxwell Smart. He does channel Don Adams when appropriate, but really makes the character his own. His chemistry on-screen with Anne Hathaway, who plays Agent 99, is great. There's been some complaints about the age difference, but they clear that up in the film.The story line is solid and helps introduce this great spy comedy to a new generation. The cast is absolutely stacked, Alan Arkin, the Rock, Dave Koechner all kick ass and help make 'Get Smart' an instant classic.If you were a fan of the original 'Get Smart' series, there's no question you'll love this movie. Check it out.",Get Smart
398,blindbat2,Shames the Timeless Comedy Gold of it's Namesake.,3,21 June 2008,"In yet another miserable attempt to make a quick Hollywood cash-in of one of televisions greatest masterpieces, Peter Segal has created a monster. Taken out of context, if one did not know Brooks' work before viewing, the movie would be a lame big budget film that isn't sure if it wants to be fat joke and stupid comedy, or just an ordinary action film with nothing to move on. However, as a young generation Y'er who just recently spent two months obsessing over the five seasons of Get Smart, the 60's TV show, this movie pained me from the moment I entered and saw Steve Carell dumbing down the part. The backstories, agent 99 getting plastic surgery and 86 as an analyst who was formerly morbidly obese, shames the complexity of the original duo and paints a flat boring reevaluation of them. It seems the screenwriters, unable to be truthfully funny in both dialogue and situation, fell back on lame set-ups for Don Adams famous lines, flashbacks to fat camp, references to Carell's part in the office in the interview style camera angles they have, and a female chauvinism that falls flat on its face.For those who have seen the original, the writers of this movie thought they'd include some memories. They mention Herbie, Fang (now a worthless tiny furry dog that Carell covets), the shoe phone, the cone of silence, and his classic red car and the doors and phone that intro'd the show. The classic music is back, but now everything is updated, generally for the worse. Cone of silence is now some weird blue telekinetic force field, control headquarters are right under a museum that preserves Control's past. The movie lacks any creative random tech, and replaces it with crossbows in swiss army knives. Lots of the ""humor"" in the movie is Carrel hurting himself, or another character being hurt, whether it be carrel spending two minutes shooting himself accidentally with the crossbow, or getting punched by security guards, or throwing up in airplanes. In the original, Smart would insult a big foe, attack him with no success, and try to buddy up with him before getting pulverized. In this one, he attacks without success and gets pummeled. It seems the screenwriters didn't understand the humor was established with the dialogue and not the pointless violence. It's like they took the names from the show, and cut out all that made it good in the first place.The poster hides Carell's face beyond that of Hathaway's. The movie likewise, shies away from anything that could make it good. They intertwine the classic music with the over-dramatic action and romantic music in big-budget films. Whereas the original fed off a campy feel, this one replaces quality with massive doses of cgi explosions and pow sound effects. I was really looking forward to this, as I finished the original series just two months ago and it ranked in my top five shows of all time. However, this was a massive disappointment. The credits say they collaborated with Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, but in all the things I've read on the internet, they were largely left out of the writing process. In conclusion, if you want to waste your money on a cash-in with little value and no respect to its namesake, go for it. But be prepared that the ride is not how you remembered it.PS: I almost forgot the George Bush humor. They mention ""Nuculor"", falling asleep at fine art, President's working for their vice pres, and appreciating tackles over solving real problems. If you're into hearing the same jokes you heard 3-4 years ago in big budget movie form, chuck your money here.",Get Smart

The movie was full of laughs and Steve Carell played Agent 86 as good as Don Adams. I went to go see this movie three times in one week! If anyone reading this liked the original Get Smart TV Series you should go watch this movie. It is filled with all sorts of lines from the old TV-Show including ""Missed it by that much!""- ""Would you believe...?"" ... My favorite line in the movie is ""Would you believe Chuck Norris with a BB Gun?"" such a funny line it is... As well as using old gadgets such as the Telephone shoe... The movie also brings back the good old characters such as The Chief, Agent 99 and Hymie. Truly classic lines that will carry on through out the years...

400,rexmorgan-bcarlton7,Mel Brooks in the Audience!--and loves the movie!,10,13 May 2008,"I saw a preview of ""Get Smart"" last week at Warner Brothers, and all my worries about what they would do with the great TV series vanished in the first few moments of the movie as Steve Carell enters Control through the famous doors, and so began one of the most hilarious comedies I have seen in a long time. To my added delight, I recognized Mel Brooks himself sitting in the back row and laughing along with everyone else! What a thrill for me that not only was I seeing an early screening of the movie, but enjoying it with my hero, the co-creator of my favorite TV show of all time. Carell and Hathaway are perfectly matched. They have somehow channeled the essence of Don Adams and Barbara Feldon. Carell is drop-dead funny throughout but especially in a scene in the airplane. We all kept laughing right into the next scene, but my favorite is a dance scene with Carell and 99 that will go down in movie history as a classic. Also, I keep remembering the hilarious scene when a kid in a car tries to call his mom's attention to Carell flying outside across the car window and she testily dismisses him. At the end of the movie there was loud applause. This is a summer blockbuster. P.S. Real fans should stay through the end of the credits because the movie is dedicated to Don Adams and Ed Platt.P.P.S. I just read the interview with Mel Brooks, and I'm delighted that he loves the movie made from the TV Series. He is certainly the best critic of it, and so it thrilled me, all the good things he said about it, because I felt the same way!",Get Smart

Why is it that writers always think they should change the shows story line or direction to reflect there creative control and for todays generation audience. These shows were great then, because the way they were and made us laugh and they did-not need changed at all.This movie was kinda funny, the cameos of some of the original cast that were still alive was nice but this movie was nothing like the original get smart the TV show that I remember Steve Carell is nothing like Don Adams and Anne Hathaway playing agent99 was boring and not very sexy and well rest of the cast was a who's who of todays so called stars.

403,ryanwelty23,Get a Real Actor,1,12 June 2008,"I remember when this was first in production, however many years ago, and I saw that Jim Carrey was optioned to play Maxwell Smart. I immediately started looking forward to the film, and then I heard that Steve Carrell was now the lead actor. In my opinion, I can't stand him as an actor. Anchorman was hilarious, but how could it not be with Will Ferrell and the hilarious mind of Judd Apatow. Carrell is not suited to be a lead actor, or if he is, not in this film. I was hoping that the film would be a re-creation of the classic TV show, but it was far from it. I was looking for the shoe phone, the ""Craw"", Larrabee, and all the other classics that made that show so iconic. Although some old jokes make their way into the film, Carrell doesn't deliver them well, like Don Adams( although that is no easy task). He tried to put way too much of himself into the role, when it would have been much better if he tried to emulate Adams, although that would be impossible for someone of Carrell's talent. Also, considering much of the original staff of Get Smart is still living, why not collaborate with them, so the movie would actually be good. If you are a fan of Carrell's stupid, attempts to be blatantly funny, then you might enjoy this movie. But, if you were a fan of the original show, save your time and money, and purchase the Get Smart Box Set. At least Don Adams and Ed Platt knew what they were doing and did it fantastically.",Get Smart

I think it was very well done.As a parent, the only real problem that I had with it was one visually sexual sight gag.

405,ejeaglesct,Funny Comedy with a Serious Plot,10,23 June 2008,"Lately there have been a lot of stupid comedies and dry dramas hitting the box office. This movie blows those movies out of the air. I never rate a movie with a 10 out of 10, but this movie kept the theater laughing the entire time, with not dumb skits, for cheap laughs. The plot set up for the movies left a bit of story behind the comedy, and the mixture of the two was perfect.Also the length of the movie was long but not too long. There have been a number of 1.5 hour short movies lately and also a lot of 1.5 hour really drawn out movies, this one was perfect. I would recommend this movie to anyone, including my mother.",Get Smart

I love Steve Carell and I think he could make a corpse laugh, but Maxwell Smart is a beloved character and those are some pretty big shoes to fill (especially when you have to make room for your phone).I was wrong. No reason for apprehension in the least. Though slightly re-envisioned, this movie was hilarious. My face was soaked with tears for a good bit of the movie and even though Maxwell isn't quite as bumbling as you may remember, I think Don Adams would have been proud of Steve Carell's take on Agent 86.Missed it by that much? No way. This was a bullseye!",Get Smart
407,coffee_rocks,Great film. Worth seeing more than once.,9,21 June 2008,"Get Smart was a more-than satisfying watch. This comedy is the kind of brilliant, stick-in-your-head kind that you'll want to quote to your friends over and over.Steve Carell is brilliant as Maxwell Smart. His goofy but innocent antics are perfect for this film, and his on-screen chemistry with co-star Anne Hathaway is realistic and incredibly entertaining.Dwayne Johnson, Masi Oka, Alan Arkin, Nate Torrence and Ken Davitian are all just as funny and lively as the stars they support, creating a terrifically performing cast that makes you want to see them again and again.Get Smart was certainly worth the wait, and I recommend it to anybody who even remotely thinks they may enjoy it.",Get Smart
408,ilurssen,Get Smart Rocks,8,25 June 2008,When I first saw the trailer for Get Smart I thought to myself it is going to be good because Steve Carell is in it. One day I was watching TV and i watched an episode of Get Smart and loved it.When i saw the movie it kind of disappointed me because there was more action than comedy but the comedy later on in the movie made up for the lack of comedy in the beginning. Everybody involved was a great actor there is even a surprise appearance by Bill Murray as Agent 13 the one who is always stuck in disguises. But the scene that definitely steals the whole movie is when Steve Carell kisses Agent 23 to escape being strangled to death. If i could give this movie my own score it would 10 out of 10 for the performances and 8 out of 10 for the comedy.,Get Smart

The Direction, Editing, and Writing were high school grade at best (Sorry high schoolers, did no mean to insult you).The on-screen talent involved was totally wasted and in the end it was A Tale Terribly Told.Don't waste your time or your rental money on this one.

I like they way they act and make the movie to be fun. I could watch it more than two times. Its a really great job that the people did on it. I hope the other people could see how good is this movie and i hope that they like it like i did. Well at first i though it was going to be that an agent save the world or a person and that it was going to last forever finding the message or the important thing he had to find.

411,chefcharlie45,Funtastic Teen Comedy,8,29 June 2008,"Get Smart starts off with Steve Carell trying his hardest to be a field-agent. His chief says he was great, but a better analyst. He goes out and meets a woman who surprises him later. He returns back to CONTROL, his job, and finds the place destroyed. He meets the same woman, Agent 99, played by Anne Hathaway. They later meet the Chief and Agent 23, played by Dwayne Johnson. The movie is hilarious, but not always appropriate for younger children. There is no drugs or alcohol besides drinking wine, but there is a brief mention of sex between two characters. In one scene Agent 99 and Max sky-dive and she kisses the assassin to distract him. Later, towards the climax we find out that Agent 23 is bad and he fights Max. Max kisses him to distract him. In the middle, Max fights a Russian and it looks as if they are having Gay Anal sex with their clothes on. The movie is still OK. It has a lot of action in more of a humorous way. I think it is a solid film.",Get Smart

But I feel like it was lacking the intensity of the original. It just felt like it was missing something. Overall the movie very entertaining and I don't regret paying $9.50 for it either. For anybody who liked the first the original, and happen to have 10 bucks and nothing better to do, get some friends and go see this movie, maybe you'll have a different view. But for the most part, I think it may have been a better idea to just wait until the movie is released on DVD.

413,flyinphil32,Misses the Mark,5,9 July 2008,"I disagree adamantly.I felt Get Smart was far too smooth and missed the original bumbling theme by a wide margin. The original was a wonderfully crazy bit of irreverent fluff in the midst of Cold War fear. The TV show was well received because it was rough and simple, plus the gadgets were futuristic. Maxwell Smart was a lame Bond that couldn't get anything right.The movie tried to make all of that too sophisticated. Too, I am not a Steve Carell fan (yet), and as pretty as she is, Ms. Hathaway is NO Barbara Feldon. Though Buck Henry and Mel Brooks are credited, I'm skeptical about their amount of input.Sorry.

I'm sure Don Adams would have loved this movie, and I'm very sad he couldn't see it himself. I'd love to hear what Mel Brooks would have said about it.

You can point out lot of things like this in different portions of the movie.

Don't waste your time and money seeing such an stupid cheap, ridiculous movie. The movie totally ignores the essence of the Maxwell Smart portrayed in the TV series created by Mel Brooks, and show a character that does not convince neither as a smart agent less as ""Smart"". What kind of agent Smart is this that sometimes is very good in doing things ands sometimes is not good..? Is very difficult to understand why Mel Brooks accepted to have his name as a consultant (is he already senile..?). This is a clear example of what happens when greed is the key motivation for creating something. Peter Segal is a clear demonstration that previous achievements do not guarantee future success. What kind of movie is this ..? an action movie, a comedy, what are the writers and director are trying to do? The previews showed very funny situations sorted by agent Smart. The movie totally destroys the humorous effect, the scenes are clumsily connected, mixed with action scenes that distracts, why they didn't show the action scenes in the previews?",Get Smart

This movie is full of comedy. Physical comedy is the most amusing from of comedy to me, so Max constantly getting hurt is hilarious to me. To people who are trying to compare it to the movie, they are not the same thing. Get over it. This movie is great because it is different.

Now I have to quantify how much money I should be demanding back from Netflix and then convince them I'm in the right. No easy task when I gave 'Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead' 5 stars. Actually, now that I think about it, I'm kind of impressed with how awful this movie is. Steve Carell typically has great comic timing, Ann Hathaway is smoking hot, and the Brahman Bull was the most charismatic man in sport entertainment. It should have been damn near impossible to screw this movie up this bad. Sure, this movie never had the potential to be really good, but I'm shocked it was this bad. So my hat is off to director Peter Segal for taking an easy formula (bumbling secret agent protagonist and straight edge heroine sidekick save the world), that worked well for the Get Smart TV show and even worked for the show Inspector Gadget, and screwing it up by trying to convince us that Steve Carell could beat up The Rock, without comic interference from the Gods, on top of a flaming SUV as it drives itself towards a train.

423,l_irish_mafia,"Crude, inaccurate, and shameful compared to the original series.",5,5 May 2009,"After seeing two seasons of the original ""Get Smart"" T.V series, I was delighted when I heard they were making a movie.This movie can be described by one word. This word is; ""Disappointing."" Before I move on to the actually film, I'd like to say that Steve Carrel did a brilliant job portraying Maxwell Smart. The others, however, didn't do so well. I don't blame the actors, I blame the script. In the T.V. series, Agent 99 was head-over-heels for Smart, but in this film, she acts the complete opposite. I as disappointed with the overall script, though the plot fit that of the original series. Another thing that really bugged me was the extra characters they threw in. Though they were amusing they did not contribute to the plot.However, there were a number of problems other than the script. First off, the original series was set in the 50's-60's. They have this one set for present day; so (For instance) the ""Cone of silence,"" is not a chamber that lowers from the ceiling, it is now a force field. And the CONTROL base is not like it was in the series; it now looks like the cliché ""American Computer Controls Agency"" base that is shown in a number of films, including the second Terminator movie.Other than the film, there were some minor, yet not so minor errors (Many of them are listed in the ""Goofs"" section). When Agent 99 and Max attempt to infiltrate a formal party, they go through a sewer and emerge in a room with hundreds of laser beams crisscrossing the hallway. Agent 99 rips of the sides of her dress, but the scene does not show her remove her high heels. The next scene shows her carefully making her way through the lasers barefoot (Her shoes can be seen by the entrance to the sewer) However, when she gets through, she is wearing her shoes again. There was no possible way she could have thrown her shoes over (Or through) the laser wall, or carried them with her. Another thing that really annoyed me was the humor. Rather than the witty jokes and actions in the original T.V series, this movie is full of incredibly inappropriate and crude humor, as well as (Surprisingly) some ""potty humor."" To say in the least, this film was a disappointment and a waste of a good opportunity. If you're a fan of the old series, don't bother with this. But, if you haven't seen the original series, do so.",Get Smart

They make Max unbearable to watch. The new 99 is very untalented and is not believable as an expert spy. She is way too young for Carrel and he looks more like her Dad. I was squirming in my seat when they started to get romantic. This movie was EXACTLY SCENE for SCENE remake of JOHNNY English. I couldn't believe my eyes or ears.

I am wondering who in his/her right mind decided that this looked good enough on paper to put on film. I had to do a technical screening and was getting paid to watch the thing ... and I simply could not wait for it to end. I was actually thinking of going up to the projection booth and shutting the film off, since it is such a violation of everything good cinema stands for. Even the Lindsay Lohan dud of last year had a plot, however ridiculous and poorly- conceived it was. Get Smart not only features some of the dumbest lines in the history of comedy, but, on top of that, has a totally incoherent ""story."" Not a single cast member gave a good performance, even though Steve Carrell is a comic genius and Hathaway is an underrated actress. Not a single character is well-defined. Not a single scene in this movie, including the action, is suspenseful. Not a single minute is watchable, since all the (not-all- that) funny moments are in the preview and simply not funny any longer when you watch this mess.

As usual, I don't listen to the experts because they like the movies that are dull as dust or they are far from being entertaining. It was so great to see Bernie. Also, they gave Anne Hathway a part that made her smart and she sure could handle herself. Don Adams always seemed to be lucky and stupid at the same time.

There were more than a couple of laughs and nearly all the old gags were there. You can definitely tell Mel Brooks and Buck Henry had their hands on this. It was funny from beginning to end. And there were points in the movie that the audience and I were laughing so hard, we missed the next lines.Almost all the old gags were there  the ""cone of silence"", the ""shoe phone"", the ""missed it by that much"", etc. The only thing they missed from the original show was the ""I asked you not to tell me that"" bit. And they did not overdo any of the gags or humor; everything was pushed to the point of hysterical and then left there for us.Steve Carell was great for the lead. At the beginning, I was not buying Anne Hathaway as 99, but she won me over.

434,paul_craig_16,Get Bent,1,1 September 2008,"Growing up, my dad used to recount fond memories of the original 'Get Smart' series that aired when he was a boy. He would enthrall us with tales of the Shoe phone, of the Cone of silence, and of Maxwell Smart's general bumbling behaviour. He then bought the series as it was recently released on DVD, and after enjoying many of the episodes I found myself anticipating the 'Get Smart' revival, starring Steve Carrell. Before seeing it, I stumbled across a review in the newspaper, which had only graced it with two out of a possible four stars. It said that the humour was plentiful initially, but, unfortunately, started to peter out near the end. I then went to this film, expecting to see an average film, and was shocked by the result. Never have I witnessed such a spectacular failure of a movie. The characters (stereotypes) were nothing we hadn't seen before. The jokes* (if in fact, they were jokes) were pathetic. The 'twist' was something I had seen coming within the first 20 minutes of the film, and, for me at least, was the icing on the turd pie. I once read an article on Steve Carrell (before the sub-par 'Evan Almighty' was released), which commented that 'awkward' was the new 'slapstick', the examples being Steve Carrell's brilliant performances in 'Anchorman', 'The Office', and, of course, '40 Year Old Virgin'. Well, the transition appears to have regressed back to a particularly awful combination of slapstick (Steve Carrell knocking himself unconscious with a dart) and painfully predictable not-funny moments (Steve Carrell's outburst at having become an agent). Summary: This film was among the worst cinematic concoctions that I have had the displeasure to have experienced, and I would advise any and all to stay far away.",Get Smart
