0,bkoganbing,SEAL Training Doesn't Cover This,8,3 November 2007,"One of the better comedies from the Walt Disney Studios in the past several years has been the Pacifier. If Arnold Schwarzenegger can manage kindergarten, than Vin Diesel can certainly babysit a whole family of a scientist who's been killed under mysterious circumstances.Tate Donovan was doing some top secret work for the government and whoever killed him didn't get what they want. That puts his family in danger. Vin Diesel's been sent to protect them.Of course getting into their lives wasn't included in the bargain. Mother Faith Ford has a handful with her kids who range from the teens down to the toddler. The handful is now dumped on Diesel.Diesel's tough guy screen image is nicely played against by the kids. Look for a very nice performance by Brad Garrett as a blowhard assistant principal who Diesel puts nicely in his place.For the conclusion, the film glides effortlessly back into the action genre we're more familiar with in Vin Diesel films.Nice film for the whole family and try to learn the Andy Panda dance.",The Pacifier
1,SnoopyStyle,good potential for Vin Diesel wasted,4,12 October 2014,"Navy SEAL Shane Wolfe (Vin Diesel) fails to rescue security designer Howard Plummer (Tate Donovan). The secret program GHOST is still missing and Shane is assigned to watch over Plummer's children possibly find GHOST in the house. Captain Fawcett (Chris Potter) escorts the widow Julie (Faith Ford) to Zurich to open a recently discovered safety deposit box. This leaves Shane in charge of five kids, the nanny Helga (Carol Kane), and a guard duck. The oldest Seth (Max Thieriot) is in trouble with Vice Principal Dwayne Murney (Brad Garrett). Zoe (Brittany Snow) is the popular cheerleader but she has problems of her own. Principal Claire Fletcher (Lauren Graham) is much nicer.The movie starts with a weak version of a 007 action scene. I don't think it's necessary especially if this movie wants to be a fun family broad comedy. Vin Diesel is fun to make fun of. That's where the movie works best and where the movie should exist. He could actually be quite a fun straight man in a comedy parodying his tough guy image. This is not that movie. Vin Diesel being annoyed with the five kids and the duck is the essence of what this movie should have been.",The Pacifier
2,Hitchcoc,Like a Hundred Other Kid Movies,6,25 January 2007,"I know it's cute and sentimental. That's all they wanted. Most of the good people are cute and sentimental and the bad guys are just pretty silly. If you are willing to accept the fact that none of this is remotely possible, you will enjoy the movie. What I liked was Vin Diesel, mugging, intimidating, getting to know the kids, treating them with respect, and so on. What I didn't like was that the house is the center of a huge military installation. It looks pretty much like any house on any street. When was all this stuff built? There is plenty of syrup for everyone, including the boy, who wants to be in ""The Sound of Music,"" and the principal/wrestling coach, played by Brad Garret, playing an ineffectual, macho mess, trying to push the son around. This really weakens the film. He is such a buffoon and serves little purpose other than comic relief. I'm sure kids will like it. It's just way too much.",The Pacifier
3,jboothmillard,The Pacifier,3,3 January 2012,"I probably saw a trailer or two for this film during its cinema release time, and naturally I thought it looked terrible, but I watched to confirm that, from director Adam Shankman (The Wedding Planner, A Walk to Remember, Bedtime Stories). Basically Shane Wolfe (Vin Diesel) is the highly trained and expert US Navy Seal who causes the accidental failure of a mission, and to make up for it he is set to be an uncover agent. The man involved in the failed mission, Howard Plummer (Tate Donovan), was killed in action, and his family are now in danger as the enemy is looking for the details of a secret project called GHOST, which he has in a safe deposit box. So Shane's mission is to look after the family, but the widowed mother Julie (Faith Ford) is out of the house a lot, leaving him on his own to keep an eye on the five children: Zoe (Brittany Snow), Seth (Max Thieriot), Lulu (Morgan York), Peter (twins Logan and Keegan Hoover), and Baby Tyler (twins Bo and Luke Vink). For a long while Shane finds it very hard to cope with the needs of the youths in the house, and he tries to lay down the rules like he would in the Navy, but it does not all seem to sink in with the troublesome kids. Slowly though they do learn to behave a bit more, and they start to like their ""babysitter"", and there only comes the low point when his time is coming to an end and the danger is possibly lessened. Of course the danger is not over, the family are tied up and gagged while the bad guys, including Shane's own commander Capt. Bill Fawcett (Chris Potter), look for the safe deposit box containing the GHOST details, but Shane saves the day, stops them, he kisses his love interest, Principal Claire Fletcher (Evan Almighty's Lauren Graham), and Shane says his goodbyes, but not before seeing a family play. Also starring Carol Kane as Helga and A Bug's Life's Brad Garrett as Vice Principal Dwayne Murney. This was not long after the awful film The Chronicles of Riddick, so Diesel was trying to cash in on the younger audience market, and unfortunately he does not completely pull it off, it is pretty much a mix of Daddy Day Care and Man of the House, only with a trained professional, and less but naturally irritating children, it is not very original, it is not very funny, and it is hardly worth watching at all, a silly family action comedy. Adequate!",The Pacifier
4,ma-cortes,"Laughs,chuckles and lots of fun with a nice and tough Diesel",6,29 March 2007,"The picture talks about a Navy Seal soldier named Wolf(Vin Diesel) is assigned by his chief(Chris Potter) the mission to protect the Plummer family(Brittany Snow among others) but their father(Tate Donovan :OC) has been murdered.The enemies are thinking that a top secret issues encounter into kids's home.Meanwhile their mother(Faith Ford: Murphy Brown)is out and the undercover agent must to keep the familiar order and care the children and teens ,while at the same time protecting the family from an attackers.Besides a foreigner servant(Carol Kane: When the stranger call )also flees from the house .Meantime he is enamored of the attractive professor of school(Lauren Grahan: Gilmore girls) of the kids.The picture displays continuous humor,laughters,noisy action and is pretty amusing.It's a blending of action, comedy and familiar film that will like to all family.The hunk Vin Diesel is enjoyable and likable as the soldier controlling the children with military methods.He suffers numerous jokes and misfortunes in charge of the children and confronting problems in his toughest mission.The film belong to the family-movies sub-genre whose maxim representation is ¨Your,mine and our¨ with Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball and recently remade with Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo, and ¨Cheaper by Dozen¨with Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt whose second installment has been directed by Adam Shankman,the same director of this one.Lively and atmospheric musical score by John Debney(Sin city,Zahura,Passion of Christ)and adequate cinematography by Peter James.The motion picture is rightly directed by Shankman.If you like Diesel's agreeable playing ,you'll enjoy this one.",The Pacifier
5,michaelRokeefe,A Navy S.E.A.L. pulls awkward duty.,5,8 July 2005,"Some situational laughs as Shane Wolf(Vin Diesel)a stout and tough Navy S.E.A.L. goes from dangerous duty to ""do-do"" duty. Wolf is assigned to protecting a military widow's(Faith Ford)five out-of-control kids. Involved in dangerous missions all over the world; babysitting duty proves to provide its own risks and humorous problems. Absolutely hilarious is Carol Kane as housekeeper Helga. School Principal Claire Fletcher(Lauren Graham), who also has military training, easily sides with Wolf and his awkward assignment. Brad Garrett is perfect as the pompous Vice-Principal and wrestling coach. Sometimes a little too cute, but after all this is a Disney Picture. The rented DVD is a cheap babysitter.",The Pacifier
6,hitchcockthelegend,Panda dance comedy panders to the norm but that's actually OK.,7,5 May 2011,"The Pacifier is directed by Adam Shankman and written by Thomas Lennon and Ben Garant. It stars Vin Diesel, Lauren Graham, Faith Ford, Brittany Snow, Max Thieriot, Morgan York, Carol Kane, and Brad Garrett. Out of Walt Disney Pictures, the plot sees Diesel as U.S. Navy SEAL Lieutenant Shane Wolfe, who is assigned to protect the Plummer family after they lost their scientist father during Wolfe's last mission. There's also the small matter of locating some top secret technology the father had been working on. But first Shane has to deal with controlling five children...So it's Vin Diesel's turn to be the tough guy willing to send himself up in the name of family entertainment. Falling in alongside the likes of Kindergarten Cop (Schwarzenegger) and Mr. Nanny (Hulk Hogan), Diesel's movie holds absolutely no surprises, more so given that it is after all a Disney production. While the critics inevitably gave it a good kicking whilst scoffing at the big bucks it made at the box office ($100 million plus in profit). I guess the big question to ask is just what do you expect from a movie such as this? With its formula and premise clearly not setting out to bend the family comedy rules? OK, perhaps the film lacks a multitude of belly laughs, and the direction is by the numbers 101, but it actually does exactly what it says on the tin.Diesel dose send himself up, while also kicking some butt along the way. The kids are the requisite of adorable or bratish, there's potential romance and there's even a comedy bonus in the form of Garrett's cringe inducing turn as power crazy Vice Principal Dwayne Murney. Hey we even have a link to The Sound of Music in the story, while the soundtrack, although sparse, is perky and witty. The acting around Diesel is variable, but this is his movie, and most of the fun is garnered from watching him peel away the layers of his macho image. You may have to be the kind of person who laughs at dirty nappy jokes, or wish to see Vin jump in to a sewer, but this is still decent family fun.A film made to tickle the kiddies and put a smile on the faces of the adults. With that in mind, it's job done. 7/10",The Pacifier
7,zardoz-13,"""The Pacificer"" Sucks",4,17 June 2007,"Brawny Vin Diesel prefers to fight Ninjas in director Adam Shankman's new comedy ""The Pacifier (** out of ****) rather than change dirty diapers. After his R-rated, sci-fi extravaganza ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" imploded at the box office last summer, Diesel must have felt that his image needed an about-face. The audience that had supported him loyally in ""XXX"" and ""The Fast and The Furious"" clearly made ""Riddick"" out of bounds. Although it has earned more money than ""Riddick,"" the PG-rated ""Pacifier"" qualifies as fare for youngsters only. Die-hard Diesel fans may applaud the actor's off-beat casting as a thespian stretch, while his typical demographic will cringe at the absence of profanity, blood, and sex. Surprisingly, the tender moments in ""The Pacifier"" prove far more genuine than the absurd, shrill, comedic attempts. Uneven, implausible, and hopelessly corny at times, ""The Pacifier"" tries to blend the Arnold Schwarzenegger comedy ""Kindergarten Cop"" (1990) with the 1983 Michael Keaton classic ""Mr. Mom."" Except for the bonding scenes, ""The Pacifier"" sucks in most respects. While ""Kindergarten Cop"" and ""Mr. Mom"" both proved consistently fresh and funny, the episodic ""Pacifier"" relies on hackneyed sit-com antics and toilet humor. When nothing else works, Shankman resorts to the surefire secret weapon of contemporary comedy: a guy getting kicked in the balls.""The Pacifier"" opens like an episode from TV's ""The A-Team."" Lt. Shane Wolfe (Vin Diesel) and a team of elite U.S. Navy Seals must rescue a brilliant Pentagon research scientist, Howard Plummer (Tate Donovan of ""Memphis Belle), from a bunch of slimy Serbian rebels. These unshaven Serbs have kidnapped poor Plummer and taken him hostage aboard a cargo boat with an escort consisting of four gunsels on jet skis and a rocket-laden Huey helicopter. Of course, Wolfe's team dispatches with these adversaries without breaking a sweat. Everything is okay, until Wolfe takes his eyes off Plummer for the split second. As our heroic Seal boards the Navy chopper that is supposed to fly Plummer to safety, Shane hears gunshots ring out. He takes a slug in the chest, and the movie fades to black. The violence in the water assault scene is as bloodless as anything on the ""A-Team,"" while we only see Shane slam backwards from the impact of the bullet that wounds him. No blood. No gore. Never do we see the body of the fallen father Howard Plummer. Hmn, that sounds like excuse for an inevitable sequel.As it turns out, Plummer had devised a top secret encryption software program designed to neutralize nuclear missile attacks. Before Plummer's widow Julie (""One Life to Live"" soap star Faith Ford) realizes how dangerous the situation is, intruders break and enter the Plummer home in Maryland. In a none-too-subtle propaganda message, ""The Pacifier"" skewers the North Koreans for harassing this helpless family. Meanwhile, Shane's superior Captain Bill Fawcett (TV star Chris Potter) assigns him to guard Plummer's five children, while the widow and he take off for Switzerland to open Plummer's safe deposit box. Julie assures Shane that they will be gone only for 48 hours, but Shane is not so lucky. He is stuck with protecting a toddler, a young boy, a 7-year old girl, and a teenage girl and guy, all of whom detest the military discipline that he brings to the house in his efforts to protect them. Before it's all over, everybody's pals and a duck bites a ruthless North Korean villain in the nuts. The only thing more out of place in this harmless hokum than political jabs at our current enemy is a stage production of ""The Sound of Music"" complete with Nazi swastikas!",The Pacifier
8,Uriah43,Okay for a Laugh or Two,5,10 May 2020,"This film begins with a Navy seal by the name of ""Shane Wolfe"" (Vin Diesel) leading a special operations team in a rescue attempt of an American scientist who has just completed an advanced satellite program. Although they manage to locate the scientist he is killed during the rescue and as a result a desperate search for his project is undertaken. To that end, Shane is given an undercover assignment to serve as a bodyguard for the scientist's five children while the wife is escorted to a Swiss bank in the hope that the project was deposited there. Although Shane has been trained for all kinds of military contingencies, what he doesn't realize is that the difficulties inherent in this particular assignment isn't something that he could have possibly imagined. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a rather clichéd comedy which has some good parts here and there but is hampered by the paint-by-numbers approach and the rather predictable ending. Admittedly, it's good for a laugh or two but other than that it's nothing to get excited about and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Average.",The Pacifier
9,anaconda-40658,This Film Needs to be Pacified.,2,15 May 2015,"The Pacifier (2005): Dir: Adam Shankman / Cast: Vin Diesel, Lauren Graham, Faith Ford, Carol Kane, Brittany Snow: Corny family comedy about solution. In this case Navy Seals Lieutenant Shane Wolfe is assigned to guard five children after their father is murdered and their mother is away to crack a code that will reveal information on a disc. He also helps oldest daughter pass drivers education as well as assist the son in the play for The Sound of Music. He even reserves time to help the youngest daughter in her Brownies group. Director Adam Shankman previously made the dreadful Bringing Down the House and again here he is given a pitiful screenplay. Vin Diesel as Wolfe is stranded in corny situations in similar fashion Arnold Schwarzenegger did in Kindergarten Cop. We know that the outcome will be violent and that Wolfe will make his point. Wasted supporting work by Lauren Graham as the school principal who is seen as a potential romance. She should really go back to that Bad Santa guy. Faith Ford as the sustained mother is a recruit from the sitcom Murphy Brown and she is cardboard here. Then there is Carol Kane as the senile nanny in a role seen countless times in equally stupid films. Brittany Snow plays one of the spoiled snotty children. She is the typical bratty teenager represented here with no brain. This film should be tossed in a sewer. Score: 2 / 10",The Pacifier
10,FlashCallahan,Do you have to wear a bra?....,5,22 August 2013,"After an elite team of S.E.A.L.s fail to rescue a scientist who developed a top secret device, the leader, Wolfe, is assigned to guard the man's children while searching for information on where the device may be hidden inside the house. Along the way, he must cope with rebellious teens, child care, an overbearing school official and foreign spies also looking for the device....Arnie did it with Junior, Hulk Hogan did it with Mr Nanny, Stallone did it with Stop! Or my mom will shoot, now its Diesels turn to make a family friendly film because his star power is slightly waning.And its what you'd expect, he hates them all at first, they hate him, but soon they all learn life lessons from each other, and I do believe that the eldest son even comes out of the closet (but you really have to read between the lines).With these sorts of films, there is always a military style subplot, this one involving a machine called ghost, which causes Diesel to do some action scenes every now and again.Its not funny, predictable, and surprisingly very violent for such a light hearted film.But my daughter loved it, and that's all that matters, but I'm sure anyone over 10 will loathe it....",The Pacifier
11,gradyharp,Whew! Pack away your brain and watch this one for the kids,3,12 July 2005,"There are legions of fans of Vin Diesel who would buy a ticket for everything he decided to make - and for good reason: the guy has charisma and screen appeal. But THE PACIFIER is one for only the most devoted Dieselers, those who also have a very high tolerance for the sugarcoated, happy-wappy, Disney flicks that feel as though they were written in an afternoon and shot the next day.Even the writers knew what Vin Diesel fans like and the movie opens with a hint of espionage with Diesel as a Navy Seal up to his action tricks. But soon he is taken out of water and plunged into a household (the family of the widow of his failed Navy Seal opening mission) where is uncomfortably cast in the role of babysitter/house mom/inept disciplinarian - you know the oft repeated situation of 'fish out of water'.The whole thing is rather silly and overplayed and Diesel is a charmer, but a comedian he is not. Once again toward the end the writers have tried to place him in his own comfortable thriller role, but even that melts into Disney goo. Only recommended for those seeking some light sing-songy diversion. Grady Harp",The Pacifier
12,zetes,Godawful!,1,11 July 2005,"Egads! There probably won't be a worse movie than this in 2005. If there is, I hope to God I miss it. Vin Diesel stars as a Navy SEAL assigned to take care of some dead operative's kids and find a secret location in their home. The plot is ludicrous and completely illogical. No one acts like a real human being. The only funny thing in the film is when the little girl asks Diesel if her boobs will ever be as big as his. Diesel is painful to watch  when Vin Diesel looks embarrassed for being in a movie, you know it's bad. Some of the children show some talent. I especially think Max Thieriot as the oldest kid has a future; he co-starred in the movie Catch That Kid last year. Hopefully he'll land some decent roles in the near future. Brad Garrett, the very funny guy who plays the brother on Everybody Loves Raymond, has a particularly creepy role  he seems like a pedophile working as vice principal. The script of The Pacifier was written by Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant, the creators and two of the stars of Comedy Central's brilliant Reno 911. Well, I guess it's no big deal if they pollute the minds of idiots when they give back so much. They also wrote the recent theatrical release Herbie: Fully Loaded. I actually fell asleep for the final 15 or 20 minutes. My mind just shut down, and I thank Jebus for it.",The Pacifier
13,mm-39,Not bad,6,11 April 2005,"The Pacifier is an okay movie. What I personally dislike is not the film, but the preview. When a preview shows the best material in a movie,then the viewer sees a flatter movie. The preview basically tells the ending of a joke. When one hears the joke the listener loses the joke's effect. Thankfully, the movie is good enough to withstand the preview. I went with my wife, and younger family. Everyone enjoyed the movie. Disney knows how to entertain the whole family. The film was directed and written well. Vin and the rest of the cast do a good job. Violence, but of the A Team kind. You do not see anyone get killed. I give the Pacifier a 6 out of 10. I wish they did not show so much in the preview.",The Pacifier
14,Smells_Like_Cheese,Predictable but fun,6,13 December 2006,"I'm not sure why, I never had The Pacifier on my mind or had an interest to watch it, but when I passed the movie at Hollywood Video, I figured maybe I could just give it a shot since it was a free rental. My friend also said that she loved The Pacifier and that I would be into it if I loved Kindergarten Cop. I have to say that while The Pacifier was extremely predictable, it was a fun little family movie that has a few good laughs here and there.Shane Wolfe is a Navy SEAL, he is very serious about his work and very dedicated to discipline. His mission was to protect a professor who created a program called GHOST and unfortunately the professor is killed, but he disk is still out, so Shane is asked to protect the professor's family and try to retrieve the disc, otherwise he has become the new nanny and may find it a bit harder disciplining tough strong guys to 5 horrific children.The Pacifier, well, you can predict one scene after the next, but this movie was intended for kids, so it's all good. I loved the scene where the Russian nanny tried to leave and Shane freaked out and tried to grab her from leaving the door, honestly, if that scene didn't make you laugh, check your funny bone. To those who haven't seen the film yet, go ahead and give it a chance, it's a good family film.6/10",The Pacifier
15,disdressed12,something different from Vin Diesel,8,27 November 2007,"i liked this movie.it's funny,it has action and it has a good message,but it doesn't hit you over the head with it.i will say though that the beginning of the movie is pretty violent.but once you get past those first few minutes,the tone becomes quite lite.Vin Diesel shows his comedic side,and does very well.there are a lot of funny moments in this movie,and there's also some mild action violence.there are a few mild swear words,but nothing offensive.Brad Garrett also has a funny role and is very good as well.if you liked either Cheaper by the Dozen(2003)or Cheaper by the Dozen 2(2005) with Steve Martin,or Yours Mine and Ours(2005),with Dennis Quaid and Renee Russo,you will probably like this movie.it is very similar in a lot of respects,but i thought it was funnier than any of those movies.it also balances comedy and action very well 4/5",The Pacifier
16,Buddy-51,predictable but sometimes likable,6,14 August 2006,"""The Pacifier"" is Vin Diesel's ""Kindergarten Cop"" (apparently every muscle bound action film star has to have at least one in his repertoire).In it, Diesel plays a Navy Seal officer sent to ""baby sit"" the five unruly children (ranging in age from infant to late teen) of an inventor who was murdered when he was in Diesel's protective custody. But Diesel, a tough guy who has been trained to take on the baddest dudes imaginable (and a man with apparently only one t-shirt to his name), finds he has gotten more than he bargained for in this latest assignment.""The Pacifier"" pretty much goes straight for all the garden variety, lowbrow slapstick routines one would expect from such a corny setup. Yet, the movie generates a surprising number of genuinely charming moments, thanks mainly to Vin Diesel himself who, though still not an actor, manages to convey a certain befuddled innocence that works well in this part. There are some perfectly awful scenes in the closing stretches that work hard to erase much of the goodwill the movie has managed to generate up to that point, but if you can look past the badness and you're in a forgiving mood, you might not hold them against the entire film. When all is said and done, it's not really much of a movie, but it's at least better than the genuinely dreadful ""Daddy Day Care"" and the two ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" films.And I sure would like to know what magical spot-removal product Diesel used to get that mustard stain out of that white t-shirt. I'd hate to think it was all just a Hollywood trick or - more likely - the result of a continuity error. But I probably know better.",The Pacifier
17,MLDinTN,quite possibly the worst movie ever made,1,20 January 2006,"I have liked Vin Diseal in most of his past films, but this movie was terrible and so was he. I can't believe all these good reviews. There was nothing funny about this. I can't believe the film's target audience of 10 year olds would even like this. From a biting duck to this stupid dance, it was just so silly. Other would be jokes would be dirty diapers, girl scouts versus boy scouts, baby bottles around the belt, teaching a teen to drive. I'm surprised Disel even went out to promote it when it was in theaters.Even the kids in this were bad. They were boring. They could have pulled some real devious pranks on Wolfe, but instead about all they do is oil up the stairs.FINAL VERDICT: Awful, avoid at all costs!",The Pacifier
18,g-bodyl,Great Family Fun!,9,19 July 2009,"This is a great movie though quite unexpected. I only know Vin Diesel from his action films such as the Fast and the Furious series.

Shane Wolfe has been assigned to free a hostage. But when the hostage dies, his next task is to take care of the hostage's kids while the mother is doing important business.The acting is great. Vin Diesel is a great actor and still kicks some butt in this film. I liked the actors who played the kids. They were wonderful.

Surprisingly Enough It's A Great Film!, With Plenty Of Laughs, And An Amazing Performance From Vin Diesel",8,9 October 2005,"Vin Diesel in a comedy??? surprisingly enough it's a great film!, with plenty of laughs and an amazing performance from Vin Diesel!. All the characters are great, and the story is really cool, plus Vin Diesel is simply amazing in this!. It's no Kindergarten Cop that's for sure, however it's still very entertaining and great fun to watch!, however the twist at the end was predictable. It also helps that the kids are all likable, and Vin seemed to be enjoying himself!, plus it had some pretty cool action scenes as well!. The opening is wicked, and Brad Garrett is hilarious in his role!, plus Vin and Lauren Graham had decent chemistry together when they were on screen. One of my favorite scenes is when Vin fights the two Ninja's by himself, and the Panda dance was pretty amusing as well, plus Carol Kane is hilarious in her small role as Helga!. I wasn't expecting much, however i am a big Vin Diesel fan and i found it intriguing that he was in a Comedy, and surprisingly enough i liked it quite a bit, i highly recommend this one!. The Direction is very good. Adam Shankman does a very good job here, with good camera work, good angles and keeping the film at a fast pace!. The Acting is awesome!. Vin Diesel is amazing as always, and is amazing here, he is extremely hilarious, likable, had a lot of charisma, seemed to be enjoying himself, had great chemistry with all of the kids, kicked that ass, had some really cool lines, and while he wasn't required to act, he was tons of fun to watch! (Vin Rules!!!!).Lauren Graham does what she has to do well as the principal she was likable and had decent chemistry with Vin. Faith Ford is stunningly gorgeous!, and did extremely well with what she had to do, which was unfortunately not much, she still looked great, and did fine in her scenes i love her!. Brittany Snow is extremely cute,as Zoe and while she was annoying at 1st, she soon became very likable, i liked her a lot. Max Thieriot is good as Seth and was quite likable.Chris Potter is lackluster here, and looked bored in some scenes, and was rather bland. Brad Garrett is very funny as the vice principal and cracked me up!. Carol Kane is hilarious as Helga, i loved her!. Morgan York is hilarious as Lulu and is one of the more likable kid actresses. rest of the cast do fine. Overall i highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5",The Pacifier
21,tabuno,An Above Average Family Movie,7,23 January 2019,"2 July 2005. In a softer side he-man movie with Vin Diesel playing a special ops having to baby-sit children while the mother goes abroad to seek to open a safe-deposit box supposedly containing a military secret. Like Man of the House (2005) with Tommy Lee Jones that came out earlier, these two movies attempt to show the feminine side of macho men. Vin Diesel's screen play is somewhat more complex with more attention to individual story lines and has a somewhat more elaborate and consistent plot, particularly with some of the scenes connecting to later scenes in the movie in a nice way. Both movies have their moments of humor as well as dramatic, emotional touches and flourishes. Entertaining, fluffy stuff with a good dose of intelligent messages embedded. Seven out of Ten Stars.",The Pacifier
22,UniqueParticle,"""Don't make a move until you're in the groove""",9,15 August 2020,I really enjoy The Pacifier quite a lot! Wonderful kids movie where Vin Diesel protects a some children while their mom is away and has lot of endearing bits throughout. A little messy in some parts but well worth it for an 90 minutes! The little pranks are awesome especially with the way (Shane) Vin Diesel puts up with it. I'd recommend this movie to anyone any age.,The Pacifier
23,Floated2,it wasn't that bad,7,10 October 2008,"The Pacifier is a great family film that is filled with action and adventure. When i saw the bad reviews and comments, i thought it was gonna be terrible but it wasn't that bad. Some parts had its flaws but it was mostly entertaining and fun. Vin Diesel as the lead role was pretty good. A funny part in the movie is when Shane was wrestling with the vice-principal. It was also cool when the robbers broke into the children's house then Vin Diesel (Shane Wolfe) started fighting them and using cool techniques. The fight scenes were cool. I also like the part near the end when Shane had to do that panda dance to unlock the code to get that device. That was pretty sick.

I'm happy to report that this endeavor is so much more than that, and stands alone, without any connection to that work than a military character in a suburban setting. Everything else is different, and well executed by these gifted child actors and Vin Diesel in his most lovable role.I highly recommend this work to any family who are looking for something worthy in which to invest their movie time.It rates a 7.6/10 from...the Fiend :.",The Pacifier
26,jimbo-53-186511,The plot is too thin for it to be really classed as anything special but it's quite fun to watch simply because it doesn't take itself seriously,6,15 March 2016,"After failing to protect a government scientist Navy SEAL Shane Wolfe (Vin Diesel) is given arguably his toughest task yet - looking after the children of the now deceased government scientist. Wolfe is not only tasked with looking after the children but he must also try to locate their father's top secret experiment whilst also trying to protect the children and his experiment from unscrupulous individuals who are trying to get their hands on this document. Could this be Wolfe's toughest assignment yet? Let's face it if you're looking for a film with a good story or if you're looking for anything remotely original then this film is probably going to be a little bit disappointing. It's evident very early on that the story is not really important in this film - even when the film ended I was convinced it only existed to set the film up and end it as it was given barely any focus at any other time. Normally this would bother me slightly but I have to admit that I was so caught up in the zany antics on offer here that I actually stopped caring about the story (which is probably one reason why I enjoyed it so much).When I looked at the premise The Pacifier looked to me like it would be similar to Kindergarten Cop and in a sense it is (albeit crossed slightly with Three Men and a Baby perhaps) - Vin Diesel is essentially in a similar 'fish-out-of water' scenario whereby his toughest assignment is to look after a bunch of unruly kids. I think what makes this film work better than it has any right to is that it doesn't take itself seriously and adopts a very tongue-in-cheek approach. You get to see silly things like Vin Diesel chasing a bus whilst riding a little girl's bike and doing a Panda dance. It's very hard not to laugh when seeing these sorts of things and a lot of the funny stuff here is actually cute rather than being vulgar. Running with the 'not taking itself seriously' theme I was pleasantly surprised that a macho type like Vin Diesel was also prepared to have himself sent up - the scene where the little girl asks him if he's got boobs was brilliant. It's clear that the writers have a good idea of how to make clean gags that work and it's also great that Vin Diesel was a good sport by allowing the p*** to be taken out of him. It's always a bit worrying when you see a macho guy try to do comedy, but like Arnie Vin Diesel clearly has the ability to pull it off and like I say the results are nowhere near as horrendous as you may think.Although The Pacifier is a lightweight and enjoyable romp there are some notable weaknesses; as I've mentioned the main story is quite thin with very little actually driving it forward (it's practically forgotten about for much of it's running time). It's a little clichéd at times and it's also not the most original of films.Whilst it's far from perfect The Pacifier is reasonably funny and it works surprising well due to the fact that it simply doesn't take itself seriously. I cannot guarantee that it will be everyone's cup of tea but I for one quite liked it and think it's a little bit underrated.",The Pacifier
27,kairingler,odd role,4,4 June 2014,"I thought this was a big mistake for Vin Diesel to take this role. but as far as the movie goes ... a Navy Seal fails to protect a Scientist and he winds up being assigned to guard the children of the scientist and also find the secret formula or something like that somewhere in the house, but it turns out he is nothing more than a mere babysitter, as he has to deal with 4 kids different ages. Still he has to look around the house and try to find out where the Scientist has hidden the key information that Foreign spys are looking for. He becomes involved in the children's life more as a father figure than anything else,, helping them get ready for school and all that,, as I can well relate to my days doing that for 3 kids,, not a horribly bad movie, just not the greatest choice of actors to play that role I believe, I could have seen Robin Williams better in that kind of role to be perfectly honest.",The Pacifier
28,Enchorde,"Not great, but might be entertaining for kids",6,5 November 2005,"Recap: Shane Wolfe, a Navy SEAL, ends up protecting the family of an assassinated scientist. He is not very happy about kids, and has few experiences outside the military, so when he is left in charge of two teenagers, a girl of about ten, a small boy and an infant plus one duck, he handles it in the only way he know how. With military discipline. To say the least, this does not sit at all well with the kids. To say the least, they keep him busy throughout the day. Diaper changes, punk boyfriends, stupid teachers and spies that seek the secret project the scientist father left behind, all complicate matters.Comments: As expected, with a set-up like this, there are bound to be funny moments. And there are. Quite a lot of the actually. But it is also clear that it is a movie made for families, so it tries to please both younger kids and adults at the same time. That is tricky, and The Pacifier's success is slightly above average. I can see that this maybe is funnier for the kids than it was for me (being over 25), but I didn't feel bored. I wasn't disappointed, well maybe in that Gary the Duck didn't have more screen time. Anyway, some jokes work, others don't. And I can imagine that the end is satisfactory for kids, with the bad guys getting what they deserve, but to a more adult audience it is a little simple. Finally I thought that the movie might be an indication if Vin Diesel can make the step from action into comedy. To me it was inconclusive. The character Shane Wolfe is intentionally very stereotypically action-man, and Diesel does that good, but his comic abilities are never put to the test. So another chance maybe.In conclusion, I guess this is a good movie for the kids, and if their parents want to come along, they won't be bored either. A fun, but not great, experience.6/10",The Pacifier
29,Kamurai25,Warning: not a real Pacifier,6,19 April 2020,"Good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.This has a lot of good points to it, and while it's a great ""fish out of water"" trope, MAN is this a dark premise for a family movie.It also has a weird message vibe that any man could run a better house than a woman, even the mother (and there was an opair). But if you look at it as more of a family / team communicating and cooperating, then maybe that's what they were TRYING to communicate.All that aside, it's funny, Vin Diesel and the kids do a great job, we get to see a young Brittany Snow, and it has a good selection of supporting cast.It manages to do some enjoyable things without being all that special.",The Pacifier
30,Rob_Taylor,"Mindless, but harmless, fun...",7,14 June 2005,"This seems to be one of those movies that people either love or hate, judging from the ratings spread.I can see why Diesel fans might take offence at this. It's hardly the tough action hero image we're used to seeing from him. But on the other hand, it shows he can actually act and has more to his repertoire than ""Hit things, run, shoot things"".Pacifier isn't going to win any awards or stun people with its originality. But it is harmless and entertaining, though in a slightly irritating way at times.But, honestly, what do people expect from a Disney production? Biting drama? Blood and Gore? I think not. It's a formula, and a tried-and-tested one at that. Still, I guess this was the sort of reaction Arnie got when he moved in to comedy some years ago.....outrage from the fan-boys that he'd do anything other than action vehicles.Watch it with an open mind and try not to get too bogged down in the silliness. It is meant to be silly, after all.",The Pacifier

I don't know why critics didn't like this movie. Maybe they didn't have enough heart in it as it did to me. Yeah, the third act of the film becomes really preposterous and laughable but it's still a good film.I would like to say some of the jokes in the film seems too gross to laugh at. It'll sometimes make you grim with poop jokes and all. Vin Diesel plays a funny role for the film. I also liked the action sequences in the film.There's nothing special about this film.

34,film-critic,Why are your boobs so big?,1,19 July 2005,"This film was bad. There was nothing of value in this entire film. I have no idea how this film grossed a little over thirty million in its first weekend. There must have been a good trailer before it, or perhaps there was a generation of people that missed the film when it was originally called Kindergarten Cop. Either way, for an hour an a half we were duped into watching nothing more than scene after scene of diaper humor, a comically unbalanced Diesel wading through the supposed funny moments, a duck, scenes where the baby of the family is left unattended, sloppy (and I mean sloppy) editing, and quick resolutions that will leave the avid film watcher confused and disoriented. Coupled with cliché after cliché, Diesel proves that he is better left in the action genre, the leaving the humor to anyone else in the world except for him.There are several people that I am extremely upset with in the world of film today. Tim Burton is currently at the top of my list, but right below him is Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon. I grew up with the humor of these guys by watching the decently funny Reno 911 and the hysterically funny MTV show, The State. When I saw that they had written this film, I was expecting to see a new level of comedy. I was hoping to see a film where the humor was sharp, the dialog was perhaps paradoxical, while laughing at all the ways they could play off the already cliché scenes that have been done in early 80s movies. Alas, this was not the case. They literally sold out. Garant and Lennon created a film that fit well into the structure of Disney by giving us bathroom humor, jagged bonding moments, and that inevitable anticlimactic ending which sums everything up in a nice little bow. Did they need the cash? My guess is ""yes"". For those that may be fans of Reno 911 or The State, I would not go into this film expecting classic humor, but instead be prepared for unfunny diaper scenes which seem to be the staple of this film.Since the story was filled with more holes than Swiss cheese, it seemed only right for Diesel to fall into that one of those holes as well. He cannot do comedy. This film, The Pacifier, proves that. There were no scenes in which he was able to generate a laugh by anyone in our house. His comic timing seemed invisible to non-existent, all the while it just seemed as if he kept waiting for the chance to walk around without his shirt and perhaps fight some bad-guys. You could tell that he felt uncomfortable in this film and was not ready to handle the pressures of comedy. Perhaps it was the direction that he was given, but Diesel continually went in and out of character. His main focus was to watch the children, but whenever he had to do something else, he completely forgot about the children and moved on. This is hard to explain, but there were several scenes when Diesel left small children unattended in the house, or in the car, or somewhere off-screen while he went searching for his ""actual"" mission. I was surprised that Social Services didn't try to boycott this film. Perhaps it was Diesel's way of being funny, but for me it just came off as sloppy. Comedy is hard and Diesel needs more work at it before he headlines another Disney bomb.Finally, I would like to say that Adam Shankman needs to really work on his direction skills. I know he has done more films than just this, but for some odd reason the editing was horrible in this film. Scenes would occur randomly while conclusions to those scenes would arise sporadically as well. It was chaos. We, as viewers, jumped around so much in this film that you just didn't get a feel of any of the characters. The Disney touch was so apparent that it forced the story to become unstructured and confusing. The wrestling to Nazi scene was especially bad, in fact, the entire Sound of Music moment was painful and disruptive to the entire film. Didn't these children's father just pass away horribly about two weeks ago? Nobody seemed to care and there wasn't one tear shed throughout the entire film. The structure on helping the children while continuously looking for ""Ghost"" just didn't fit. There needed to be more stories, more moments between the children, more glue instead of chaos holding these scenes together. The random relationship between Diesel and Graham was idiotic, while the entire concept of falling in love with these children in just short of two weeks blew my mind. We were all over the place in this film and it hurt.Overall, this film was worse than pathetic. All three key elements to this film, the writers, the ""major"" star, and the director just didn't seem to be on the right page. It was sad to see such great comics like Lennon and Garant churn out duds like this. It was sad to see Hollywood resort to the clichéd 80s concept of bringing an action star into comedy and watch him fail miserably. The story was horrendous and glued together by a two-year old. The comedic moments were non-existent, while Diesel wandered through the entire film, in and out of character, hoping to revive a dying career. Nobody made me laugh. Nobody was funny. Nothing was worth viewing a second time. If you are looking for a decent comedy that fully represents the key elements in this film, I would check out the comedic actor John Candy tackle it in Uncle Buck.Grade: * out of *****",The Pacifier
35,jon.h.ochiai,"""The Pacifier"" Suits Diesel Just Fine",8,6 March 2005,"I did not really know what to expect from Director Adam Shankman's ""The Pacifier"" starring very serious action star, Vin Diesel. Shankman had done well with ""Bringing Down the House"" with Queen Latifa and Steve Martin. So having Vin Diesel as a no nonsense Navy SEAL protecting a family of 5 kids in the middle of suburbia in a Disney release, no less, seemed like an artistic stretch. To ""The Pacifier""'s credit, it works. ""The Pacifier"" is predictable, and shamelessly sentimental at times, which is expected. Through it's charm, family message (invariably centered around discipline), and likable characters, ""The Pacifier"" becomes one of those rare commodities-- great family entertainment. I am a fan of Vin Diesel. In ""The Pacifier"" he proves to be a deft straight man. Props for Diesel. He is going out on a limb with his action hero persona, particularly in a hilarious bit with the ""Panda Dance"". Diesel is still a commanding physical presence, though this outing as a kinder, gentler Navy SEAL, Shane Wolfe, may hold promise for his longevity. He really displays a flair for light comedy. He has the kind of charm where he is never over shadowed by the cute kids-- that is no small feat.Outwardly, Diesel's Navy SEAL Lt. Shane Wolfe is the powerful leader of men, whose team is sent to rescue scientist Howard Plummer (Tate Donovan), from Bosnian terrorists. In the thrilling operation Shane is able to rescue Plummer. However, in an apparent betrayal Plummer is murdered and Shane is left for dead. Shane recovers, and is assigned by his commander Capt. Bill Fawcett (a good Chris Potter) to safe guard the Plummer family. Turns out that Howard Plummer invented a strategic warning system called GHOST. Fawcett and Plummer's widow (the charming and beautiful Faith Ford) are off to Zurich to retrieve the contents of Howard's deposit box. Both the software and hardware for GHOST are missing and their location unknown. Things don't go as planned in Zurich-- really shocking, well not really. So what was supposed to be a weekend of babysitting turns in to an extended assignment for Shane and the Plummer kids.Shane can run a complex and dangerous operation behind enemy lines in his sleep. Dealing with teenagers, being a Girl Scout Den Mother, and changing a baby's diaper, now that is really tough for this combat veteran SEAL. Zoe (Brittany Snow), the oldest daughter, has boys on her mind, as well as getting her driver's license. Zoe has taken the loss of her father to heart, and puts on the teenage bravado to reassure her siblings. Seth (Max Theriot) ditches wrestling practice, because his passion is theater, and playing a lead in ""The Sound of Music"". Lulu (Morgan York) is the not so confident Girl Scout, being bullied by some Boy Scouts at the local Costco. York steals the movie. Peter (Kegan and Logan Hoover) is not toilet trained. Tyler (Bo and Luke Vink) is the baby with the digestion issues. These are all good touches.Predictably Shane (Diesel) reveals his big heart when it comes to the Plummer kids. What is well done is that Shane's demand for discipline is unwaivering in the process. Discipline is like breathing for Shane, but it is tempered by respect, honor, and compassion. No one will be harmed under Shane's watch. The screenplay by Thomas Lennon and Ben Garant provides the atmosphere for this apparent evolution of Shane. Lennon and Garant allow Shane's methods to remain unchanged while he really gets to know what is important to the Plummer kids, and ultimately shares himself. Diesel has a nice scene where he tells Zoe about his father. There is a great comic touch when Shane takes over as Director of ""The Sound of Music"", seeing how important it is for Seth. When he schools Seth's wrestling coach, Murney (good goofy Brad Garrett) in the art of hand-to-hand combat, it is hilarious. Shane's scenes with Lulu (York) are priceless, and pulls at the harp strings. They are allowed. Ultimately, ""The Pacifier"" is about family, and making someone part of your family. This may sound corny, and it worked for me.Shankman has made a surprisingly satisfying and entertaining movie in ""The Pacifier"". This is one for the whole family. Vin Diesel's venture into a kinder and gentler persona was a risk that paid off. This action star has other gifts. ""The Pacifier"" is well worth seeing.",The Pacifier

"" - Shane Wolfe (Vin Diesel)",4,4 September 2005,"Let's start off this brief review with a positive note - 'The Pacifer' was better than I thought it was going to be. Saying that, I have to be honest I thought it would suck. It didn't quite suck, but it wasn't that good either. 'The Pacifer' has some very funny moments but they are more then out-numbered by the sappy, silly and pathetic sequences the movie is all-too-willing to offer. Vin Diesel is Vin Diesel (playing pretty much playing the role he always does), while comedians Brad Garret and Carol Kane (as the family's Russian nanny) are a real treat to watch. Lauren Graham really phones her performance in, while the rest of the kids are actually not that bad. To be more specific, 'The Pacifer' starts out very strong and ends very weak. I recommend this film if it's a Sunday afternoon, you have nothing else to do and you happen to come across it on television. Otherwise, don't even bother. In conclusion, it's funny at parts but it's mostly just plain old-fashioned sappy Disney cinema. Grade: C",The Pacifier

Who has a secret lab thing under their garage. Who hires a navy seal to watch their children? This movie stunk worser than New York Minute. The Pacifier wrestling move is only used once so why is that the name of this movie. Brad Garrett was a terrible actor in this having kids pick on Seth The Performer. Seth is really weird. He just takes off and starts a play. That Vin Diesel ends up directing for him because the director dropped out because of the children's terrible acting in the play. The movie makes no sense at all. I hated it so much and am glad I'm never watching it again",The Pacifier
45,christian123,Dreadful and Boring,3,5 July 2005,"Vin Diesel plays Shane Wolfe, a disgraced Navy SEAL, assigned to protect the five children of a scientist who was murdered while working on government secrets. He quickly learns that taking care of kids is going to be the hardest assignment he's ever taken.The premise isn't very original but I was still expecting this to be a fun movie. However, The Pacifier is a lazy family film that only the kids will like. The screenwriters could have attempted to expand the audience but they didn't. They pretty much leave everyone over the age of 15 out of the fun. The movie only had one goal and that was to entertain the kids. For the most part, they succeeded even if they used cheap gags and annoying characters to get the job done. Well, I'm not too surprised the script is really weak since it was written by the same people who brought us Taxi. I know the Pacifier is supposed to be a fun, harmless movie but it was quite tortuous at times and I blame it on the lazy screenwriters.Vin Diesel is an okay actor. I can't see him winning an Oscar anytime soon but he's better than Paul Walker. His performance here wasn't very good though. It was rather dull and it wasn't very funny either. It's not really his fault since he was probably told to play his character seriously so that in awkward situations, he would seem to be funny but it backfired and made the film more unbearable. Morgan York gave the best performance and she has the most memorable lines. Brittany Snow was okay, nothing special. Max Thieriot also gave an okay performance though I really didn't like his character. Faith Ford appears in the movie for about 15 minutes so it would be kind of pointless to see this film because of her. Lauren Graham gave an okay performance, I prefer her on Gilmore Girls though. Brad Garret was terrible since he tried way too hard to be funny and it just failed completely.Adam Shankman directs and he does a decent job. I wouldn't say he did a good job because the movie is kind of bland and inoffensive. He really put no element of surprise and he shot the film right down the middle. I'm kind of surprised he didn't make the film better since he also directed Bringing Down the House and that film was pretty funny. Since this is strictly a kid's movie, I thought the film was very dull and not very funny. They seemed to try too hard and it didn't work out at all. They were some funny moments but not enough to sustain the running time. In the end, The Pacifier is a harmless film for kids but everyone else should skip it. Rating 4/10",The Pacifier

The whole movie runs on predictable lines which I didn't mind at all. Vin diesel performed very well trying to gain favor of family audiences. Among kids, I liked the Lulu character.

47,januszlvii,A Modern Classic,10,4 February 2021,"The Pacifier is a modern classic for the entire family. It is about Shane Wolfe ( Vin Dissel) a Navy Seal whose superior Captain Bill Fawcett ( Chris Potter) orders him to babysit a bunch of kids named the Plummer's after their father is murdered and their mother has to get a key to a safe that contains an important computer program called ""The Ghost."" Of course, Shane knows nothing about dealing with kids, and the kids know nothing about a military man. What really works is the character growth in not only Shane, but some of the kids as well. Most important was Zoe ( Brittany Snow) who is heartbroken over her dad's death, and feeling responsible for the younger kids. There is a very effective scene where she cries about it, and Shane explains he basically grew up an orphan. Brittany also had trouble with driver's Ed, and Shane taught her to drive ( a skill that became crucial at the end of the movie). Another one of the kids, Seth wants to be an actor and is doing The Sound Of Music. He is also on the wrestling team and he is picked on by Coach Murney ( Bill Garrett). Shane is able to help Seth by beating Murney on the mat and becoming director of the musical ( he saw the movie as a kid, and teaches the discipline necessary to get it to work on the stage). The kid he is closest to is Lulu and she is in a Girl Scout type group called the ""Fireflies."" He teaches Lulu and all of the girls self defense and self respect which helps when dealing with boys who pick on them. There is also a love interest ( Claire Fletcher played by Lauren Graham) who is the kids school principal, and she used to be in the Navy. Spoilers ahead: Are their problems? Of course, Fawcett turns out to be a traitor working with the North Koreans. ( who have agents as next door neighbors). Does Shane defeat Fawcett and the North Koreans and recover ""The Ghost"" while ending up with Claire? Of course, but how he does it ( with a big assist from the kids and Claire) and how he grows from being a ""Fish Out Of Water"" whose entire life was the Navy to someone who found a brand new life with Claire and becoming a wrestling coach is why you watch. As a modern classic it is an Easy 10/10",The Pacifier

I mean, it has every cliché in the book and then some, and though none of the jokes are really funny, many of the story elements are a bit more...how should I put it? Odd? A bit more odd than your usual CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN cookie cutter family flick. It's odd to have a duck play a major role in the story's climax (in fact odd to have a duck in the flick at all); odd to have the SOUND OF MUSIC play such a large role; odd for Girl Scouts to learn Kung Fu. Odd, yesbut still desperately bland and unfunny! The guy who directed DODGE BALL could have done wonders with this one. As it is, however, this was just junk.

49,I_Am_The_Taylrus,Nicely Done Family Film(SPOILERS),6,27 January 2007,"SPOILERSWow, Vin Diesel in a children movie? You have to see it to believe it. Even though he plays his usual tough guy role he does a pretty good job portraying a guy in a children film. I thought this was a moderately entertaining film, but it is really predictable. Some of the material has definitely been done thousands of times before but a lot of the sequences, such as the ninja attack, are fun to watch.A Navy SEAL named Shane Wolfe has to protect a family. Their father made a mysterious thing called GHOST and some people want it. The father is gunned down. Shane instantly realizes this is his toughest challenge yet, being as the mother had gone away and the rowdy children hate him. Then ninjas attack the house trying to look for GHOST. The oldest son also plays a Nazi in a play for the Sound of Music. Shane has to be the director. Shane orders all the children around and they eventually become soldier type things. Then the ninjas are revealed to be the next door neighbors. The mother comes home. Then Shane finds out that to get the GHOSt he has to act out the song that the father use to sing to the second youngest son. Shane gets GHOST, which was a computer chip. In the end the Sound Of Music play is played.Overall, this is a really neat little children movie. I also found that the idea of the song being the key way to get GHOST was a little like something that was mentioned in a Simpson episode thirteen years before this movie was released, and I do not think it took thirteen years to make this movie. Anyway, this is an enjoyable family film that is not a pain to watch, even though it gets boring at times, but it is nice nonetheless.6/10Recommended Films: Cheaper by the Dozen.",The Pacifier
50,the amorphousmachine,Contrived Vin Diesel flick that feels like his version of Kindergarten Cop! Vin is no Arnie!,5,27 March 2006,"(CONTAINS MASSIVE SPOILER IN COMMENT) Vin Diesel's version of Kindergarten Cop (1990)?! Who knows? This yawn-inducing flick has some saving graces, but it has been done many times before. A cooky character, or hard-nut (ala Vin Diesel's character) who you could never imagine raising kids enters an abnormal family situation, and eventually becomes a part of the family, or significantly improves their lives. Helps solves their problems. See 'Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star', 'Uncle Buck' and many others that used the same tired formula.However a couple of scenes worked in the movie such as the quite funny scene involving the youngest daughter selling cookies is amusing and cute, and the kids do save this film from being complete rubbish. The other thing I liked was the many nods to 'The Sound of Music', which was one of the first flicks of a similar ilk (just replace a Nun with a Navy SEAL in a less elaborate film). The nods were things like the kids being part of the Plummer family, the play itself within the movie, and lastly, the cheesy homecoming scene for the mother where she hears her kids sing, though that was probably overkill. Things that really annoyed me was the wrestling teacher/vice principal Murney (Brad Garrett) squaring off with Vin Diesel, and how elements of the story of Shane's interaction with the kids becomes plot-solving pointers in the climax- such as Zoe's (Brittany Snow) driving lessons, and particularly ****MASSIVE SPOILER HERE**** the panda-dance song that Shane uses to get a kid to sleep being the ""secret"" way for Shane to solve the protected trapped area where the item that government was after was stored. It was such lame use of a plant or pointer or whatever you call it! And to add insult to injury, Shane utters the last line of the song to defeat in the villain a good five minutes after he did the dances to avoid the booby-trapped area! The whole panda-dance scene made the film even more lame and contrived than it already was! If you're a Vin Diesel fan, you may like this flick! I am not a Vin Diesel fan and I find his acting so wooden (Arnie, at least, looked like he was been driven nuts in his version)! However, as a film, only the kids themselves and a few moments save this flick from being pure trash. It's climax alone and particularly the use of certain child-raising methods from Shane seemed ridiculously contrived in wrapping the film up! However, it's not the worst I've seen! **½ out of *****!",The Pacifier

It is more than the typical fish out of water about a Navy SEAL who must babysit five kids because they are vital to national security. He teaches the kids self respect. In the course of the movie, he manages to not only stop the bad guys from hurting the kids but 1) teaches the oldest to drive, 2) directs a school production of The Sound of Music, 3) teaches self defense to a troop of girl scouts, and 4) fall in love of course. Vin Diesel is very good in this movie. Lauren Graham is also good as the school principal and love interest for Diesel. I am not a Gilmore Girls watcher but I think Graham is very appealing in this movie alone and I would like to see more of her.

I was really surprised to see Vin Diesel trying to bring this movie to a good end, and I still do not understand why it was Vin who ventured into this project, maybe they offered him a lot of money or what I know, but this is Definitely a setback in his career. If in ""XXX"" Vin Diesel promised something interesting because of his physique, here, it really is a flop.The discourse here is to entertain with the gap between a main character with certain physical characteristics and the environment in which he lives. Then we find the variants that point directly to all situations embodied in the tape are funny by the mere fact of seeing a lord of voluptuous physical surrounded and charged with watching over children and adolescents. Undoubtedly this proposal was seen and too similar in another film that had as protagonist Arnold Schwarzenegger (""Kindergarten Cop"", 1990). But beyond that, the film is not overwhelming from any point of view from the humorous aspect, nor from mere entertainment. Of course we should not look for messages or morals to this series of nonsenses that constitutes ""The Pacifier"".A film with forced plot, which highlights a military education as a narrative methodology, which has nothing to do with the childhood pastime that in definitive constitutes this failed proposal.",The Pacifier

Vin Diesel is a CIA agent, who hears that a family has some certain microchip in their house called ""The Ghost."" But, this chip is targeted by some villains who want it. Yes, it was only made to make a funny situation of a tough man protecting little kids. Yep. That's got to be a cliché.The movie is genuinely predictable. I remember my friend knowing the ending to one scene, before it ended. How's that for predictability? But, the movie has one thing going for it: It's funny! Whether it's silly or witty, The Pacifier mostly fails at story line, but makes a good comedy if you're not afraid to laugh. Some funny jokes were ""boobs"" one (not appropriate for kids by the way), the one with the baby-sitter singing, and the one about the war with the gnomes.No, the movie isn't great, but it makes quite a decent comedy.

It's your typical fish-out-of-the-water scenario, where a Navy seal (Diesel) is placed in a situation that he is not ""comfortable or suited"" (i.e. care provider of five kids).The movie opens with LT Wolfe on a search and rescue mission, in which, he blotches. The victim is killed, and Wolfe is injured. The film fast-forwards two months, Wolfe has fully recovered and back on the mission; however, there's one small exception, he must now ensure the safety of the Plummer children. Dr. Plummer, who was killed earlier in the film, has developed the ""GHOST"" program which can prevent foreigner threats from launching their nuclear armaments by changing their launch codes. The only problem is that no one knows where the program has been hidden.

The action was done so amateurishly, and was really unappealing. Stuckmann's attempt at showing some heart and emotion, came off so cliché, and forced, leaving everyone's character to be underdeveloped and boring.I'm really not the biggest fan of Vin Diesel, so it goes without say, he didn't impress me whatsoever. His character development was whatever, but he tried his best at the end of the day. Adam Stuckmann didn't do a very good job balancing these characters. It was hard to care for all of them, because they were so one dimensional.The screenplay by Thomas Lennon, who's a comedian writer, and Ben Garant, who has the same style, was stereotypical, uncharming, and pretty stupid, with poor jokes.

Once he gets saddled with this family of kids to guard (I've honestly already forgotten just how many there were), he appears to wish he were in ANY movie except this one -- and so do they! The plot, such as it is, involves a hodge-podge of suburban ninjas (yes, really), hidden vaults and honest-looking betrayers. Don't bother trying to figure it out. The only exception to this cinematic disaster is Max Thieriot, who is quite good as the sulky teenager.

The movie fails on every level.The movie is obviously a 'Kindergarten Cop' ripoff: Big tough Navy SEAL guy (Diesel) gets stuck with a babysitting assignment. I can imagine Arnold Schwarzenegger doing this material (and better), but Vin Diesel just looks lost throughout the entire film. 'The Pacifier' commits a number of movie sins, but its most glaring is that it is criminally unfunny. Folks, I didn't even crack a smile watching this travesty. The rest is just stupid family movie clichés: Diesel and the kids hate each other, Diesel is subjected to unfunny slapstick, they start to ""bond"", and the movie gets gooey.This is a waste of celluloid, my time, and parents' money.

The moment of glory occurred we got to see Diesel performing the ""Peter Panda"" dance - not just once - the same dance routine was also used for a second time to figure out the ending.

However, I guess he wanted to show that he can have a more gentler side to him and just wanted to be versatile. Hey, it worked for Arnold in Twins and Kindergarten Cop, so why not Vinnie? Anyways, this movie is about what you'd expect. It's a twist between Three Ninjas and a typical Disney movie. Yes, it does have some action scenes in it, but it's still not the typical Vin that we know of. I think this movie worked just fine for him and I think he came off fine. He doesn't try to act like he's a comedian or anything and that's what makes this movie even funnier... When an actor knows that they can't do comedies on their own acting ability... then when they act natural, it makes it funnier when gags or things happen to him.

Coming up in a time that the big strong silent Arnold clones were obsolete there was this guy all of a sudden, hitting hard with Pitch Black.Then there was the enjoyable ""Man apart"" which was in my opinion a lot better then expected and the fast and the furious.. which marked the started of his hot air era.The fast and the furious was over-hyped and empty, xxx was even worse , riddick was full of love.. for himself and little by little the promise he once showed seemed to fade. Then came the pacifier around, and this is the type of film I expect to have a pre engineered script at the basis of it. Pre engineered in a way it has been ""written"" to please certain target audiences and not in an effort to make a good film.It is obvious that this film is only made to give Vin Diesel access to certain mom and dad audiences he couldn't reach with his earlier efforts. Everything in this film is based on playing it safe giving the viewer a predictable Luke warm rehash that invites to nod off semi permanent. Think the very very worst of the older Disney movies, add the very worst of the Sylvester Stallone family entertainment ( another disappointment) outings and it gives you this.For a man that - if I can believe his interviews- had to really fight to get where he is now Mr Diesel shows a remarkable lack of courage in his choosings for parts. I really hope he has been ill advised by his agents to take these parts and that it is not completely his own choice.One has to keep some hope...Skippable",The Pacifier

What this had that other typical family films didn't was Vin Diesel, who did a good job at his first comedy. He does a nice job of play the fish out of water. I know critics demolished this movie and said no one would see it, but i recently went to a sold out crowd and even bigger crowd having to buy tickets for a later show. Shawn Levy made a good point once when he said that family films aren't going anywhere, because i think as a nation we need them and they show us crazy families that might resembles ours. And there always so dang cute. The kids in this one were especially cute especially Morgan York. I recommend this nice and kind family movie.",The Pacifier
76,worthythorn24,Better than I had expected,6,6 September 2005,"Vin Diesel will never win an Academy Award, but his choice of roles here was definitely something alien to him: Comedy! This film is definitely along the same lines of the vastly superior ""Kindergarten Cop"", but enjoyable nonetheless. We don't really see anything new here, but it's a movie that is family friendly and adults will also get a few chuckles here and there (mostly from watching Diesel struggle to change diapers and doing the ""Panda Dance""). Also, watch for Brad Garrett in this film, as he really puts in a hilarious turn as the wrestling coach. Lauren Graham just seems misused here, as her character does nothing but provide a meaningless love interest for Diesel. She is a really good actress, but I just felt like she did this film for a paycheck (then again, who would want to work for free?). I would recommend checking it out for good, family fun. 6/10.",The Pacifier

79,Nightopian-Raposa,Entertainment value through the roof,8,17 January 2020,"In the 90s and 00s there was a trend of movies about a person (mostly a rich man) forced to take care of a child or a group of children who are very different from the adult. Films like Uptown Girls or Old Dogs come to mind, but possibly the most notorious (and my personal favorite) is 2005's The Pacifier. For this movie dared to do what no other studio but Disney would do: Put Vin Diesel in a family comedy. Diesel plays Navy SEAL Shane Wolf, whose mission to save Professor Howard Plummer (Tate Donovan, the actor who pops up frequently in some films) fails after the latter is shot (offscreen) right as he boards the rescue helicopter. This does not count as a spoiler because it's in the beginning of the film. A few months later, Shane, still recovering from those old wounds, is assigned the task of watching over Plummer's 5 children while his widow travels to Switzerland (of all places). While he's taking of the kids, he also needs to find a top-secret program (called GHOST) created by the professor that has the ability to disable a country's nukes. Mind you, this is a Disney film. At first, the children don't find Shane's SEAL-like way of babysitting them useful, but as the hardened soldier learns more about the kids and their struggles, he warms up to them.I find this film to be the best of its kind because of the sheer novelty of an actor who starred in 2 straight-up action films for Rob Cohen starring in a picture where he gets upstaged by underage people. Would definitely watch again. Watch it if you're bored on disney+.",The Pacifier

In this movie you'll laugh your pants off as Vin finds out he has to take care of a family who just want to be left alone. The thing that mad The Pacifier the great movie is its got humor and most of all its got action. Or course what Vin Diesel movie is a movie without action.

Think about it, have you ever gone to a Disney Film and not seen the story throw it's characters into the worst possible scenario only to find a quick fix with a lesson to be learned? Oh yeah, there's always that Happy Ending thing too. I enjoy any film that makes me laugh, whether it be witty humor, or just plain cheesy slap stick. The bottom line is you leave the theater with that warm fuzzy feeling inside that just makes you feel good.

You sit down, watch it, laugh a little, think about how cute the kids are, then go on with the rest of your day. A lot of action stars have taken a turn at comedy to soften their image, Stallone and Arnold S. to name a couple, so Vin Diesel is in good company there. I think it is a decent, light movie worth at least a matinée viewing. The kids are charmers, Vin Diesel doesn't seem to mind being the but of jokes, and most of the acting is good. And ladies, he spends most of the movie in tight t-shirts, and according to my wife has a nice posterior region. Guys you have to settle for Lauren Graham's sweet smile.",The Pacifier

I will admit that there were some funny parts in the movie but as the previews showed the little girl falling out of the fan crying ""Land"" well it doesn't happen like your expecting, quite a let down if you ask me. Second of all the movie bounces quite a bit and has a lot of ""important"" characters, like the wrestling coach, and the principal. they both had great opportunities for character development but i'm guessing that would have taken to much time. also there were not as many funny moments with the kids as i was expecting.

Up to this point I had stayed away from watching this movie figuring it would be terrible. I was pleasantly surprised at how entertaining it was. I liked the movie. I want to see it again, but from the beginning. I believe it is more a family film, and kids would love it. No bad language, and some funny moments. It is a about a navy seal who is a babysitter/nanny who takes care of 4 kids while their Mother is away. There is espionage, and plenty of action as the babysitter takes care of a family of teen to baby age kids. I loved the scenes where he was able to protect the kids from ninja's that appeared from no where to steal some file the father had hidden. There was plenty of fun and games, and even some romance. I liked the film and Vin Diesel was great as the babysitter. I liked the action scenes where basically Vin Deisel cleaned the bad guys clocks!! I laughed and enjoyed the movie.

The plot is very, very weak and is only there to hold up the idea of a tough guy as a babysitter. The plot makes its appearance at the beginning of the film, then at the end. There are many prime moments for some good comedy bits, but they just float on by. Either the writers ignore them completely, or the joke falls flat. I did laugh a few times, however.

This film shows true Disney Magic, and it's a treat to see Mr. Diesel be a part of it. He demonstrates a really good (if not broad) range in his character, and he shows that he's definitely not a one-note actor.

89,sati_84,"Not pure genius, but surprisingly entertaining",7,8 June 2005,"When I decided to watch this movie, I expected a silly, not really convincing comedy with lame jokes. I thought, that the movie wants to capitalize on Vin Diesel. And he was almost the only thing why I watched The Pacifier. And I was disappointed... in a positive way.Vin Diesel is awesome. After the brilliant Chronicles of Riddick (8/10) we get a comedy with him. And he is funny! Of course, the movie has its serious moments, when it's trying to deliver a message to the viewers, but it's OK - all of this scenes are saved by Vin Diesel. The Peter Panda dance is hilarious, so the movie works very well.On the other hand, it has some tasteless jokes (I cannot and will not laugh when someone is farting) and let's face it: it's a simple family movie. It does deliver some messages, but it's done in a traditional way. So nothing special about it.SPOILER There is a scene, when Zoe is crying, because she misses her father so much. The chemistry between the two in that scene is believable (so, the movie works again). That is the best scene of the movie. Zoe simply says: ""You were right about him"" - referring to her (ex-)boyfriend. This line represents the fact, that Zoe could develop a new view in herself. How many of us could do something like that when we are in a situation like this? Zoe is strong, and this is the message that the movie tries to deliver: we have to find the strength in ourselves, no matter what happens to us or to someone we love.END OF SPOILERThe movie is perfect in every way in its genre. However, I didn't like some jokes (which were on the tasteless side), the atmosphere isn't right in some of the scenes, and I'm not so into the genre anyway (I prefer deeper movies, such as Groundhog Day or Memento). So I gave it a 7.If you like Vin Diesel, don't miss it! You'll be surprised! The guy can make comedy! He became one of my favorite actors with this movie.Keep it up, Vin! 7/10",The Pacifier

The acting was good, the writing was just off-kilter enough to surprise, and the plot, while predictable, was only predictable a few seconds in advance (which is about how long it took for Vin Diesel's character to process a thought). Our little group of cynics was charmed and quoting lines from the movie all the way home afterwards. We agreed that it was indeed a Disney movie, but it didn't have the cheesy hollowness and wannabe withitness that has hampered those productions since Hayley Mills was my age. Bits of it were unexpectedly moving. Vin Diesel's little side romance was also charming, with a breath of gentle kinkiness (""On land, you're the superior officer,"" he says to his honey, and she smirks.) Basically it was funny, stupid, and sweet without being annoying, and Vin Diesel was excellent in it.

Ben Diesel is a hardened Navy Seal. He is assigned to protect the children of an operative who was recently assassinated while their mom goes to Switzerland urgently to retrieve contents of a bank deposit box. The box may contain the secrets that dad died to protect. With only his military training to draw upon he is able instantly and successfully do what many parents struggle with on a daily basis... to control and motivate 5 children ages 1 to 15. There is the requisite diaper changing scene. And of course they are attacked one night and Ben is able to save them off without suffering so much as a scratch. There are mild teenage tantrums but the children are surprisingly unaffected by the sudden death of their dad. Okay, dad did travel extensively to foreign assignments but you would expect a bit more grief. That is the problem with the story, how to put tough macho Ben Diesel suddenly into a family of 5 children. It is a similar problem with ""the Upside of Anger,"" when dad is suddenly gone and the children manage to just go on like nothing happened. It is also difficult to put violence murder into a family oriented movie by treating it like a float in the Mainstreet light parade. I'm not against Disney movies and have seen some awesome Disney films in the past year, this just doesn't happen to be one of them. (I'm referring to ""the Miracle"" and ""Mystery Alaska."") That said, my husband liked it more than I did, thought it as worth 7-8 stars, but he can voice that when he writes a review. If you need to babysit for preteens then this is the movie for you.

However, something goes haywire, and the scientists ends up dead (this isn't a spoiler in case you were wondering; it's the opening sequence). Well, for some reason, he has to stay in the home with the guy's wife and kids and maid. Needless to say, mayhem ensues. It largely uses bathroom humor and the mini culture clash between the operative and large family home. There are some sweet moments.

Anyway, she loves it, I really like it. You have to watch it for what it is, a light hearted CHILDREN'S FILM. It is not an adult action film. IN all honesty, how many original ideas are there, in 100 years of film, just about everything has been done. I have taken to watching older movies for the most part because they are more story and character based and not based on high-tech expensive effects.. which is what most movies today are lacking. Special effects just don't cut it for me, I like interaction between people or animals or something. I want to see comedy, i want to see happiness, sadness etc. I want to see people being people, even if they are superhero's I want to see them do more than shoot things or fly around. This movie is fun. I have watched it over and over with my 4 year old girl. She loves it, she refers to it as the DUCK movie. She likes Vin , she thinks he is a good daddy... I have watched this movie with a 12 year old girl, 9 year old boy, 6 year old boy and a 4 year old boy.. and all of the kids liked it. I have yet to find a child that hasn't liked the movie. I am sure that there are some out there, but it is a fun movie that is good for an all ages movie night. There are no semi-sex scenes thrown in for good measure for the adults to like, there are no shoot-em scenes to appease the older alpha male crowd. There are no bad words thrown in just because.. it is a movie geared for children and families and it does a good job. It is certainly easy enough to watch or listen to, if you have one, like mine that may watch the same movie over and over for a month and then only want to see it every six months after that.. I watched Big Jake and McClintock each for months at a time, this was the movie, right after those two.. and I can honestly say, it was a pleasing break, and Vin Diesel is very easy on the eyes.. and he addresses issues that a lot of guys have.. how do you change a diaper, how do mom's fit everything into a day, how do you know what the 3 year old is doing, the 12 year old and the 17 year old.. how do you keep track of all of them at one time, keep them all contained, all the energy going in the right direction.. he makes motherhood look exactly like it is, not a walk in the park, to be loved, but definitely hard work Nicole",The Pacifier

It was pretty obvious that I should have expected a complete nonsense of a script, and the movie won't let you down in that particular aspect. There are some particularly silly moments - which I believe are supposed to be funny - and other less silly and actually funny moments, which makes this movie at least better than the latest installment of the American Pie series! Unfortunately, the acting in general is as bad as you would expect, since the main star is none other than Vin Diesel. It's actually painful to watch a few of the scenes unless you really couldn't care less about what's going on on-screen.

As usual the family finds it difficult to accept an officer staying with them and so major part of the movie concentrates on this front.Finally they develop a liking towards him and he also starts feeling the same. The funny part is the movie is funny and the fights in the movie also are funny. The climax which i thought to be nasty and will have some action turned out comic as the rest of the movie.

101,Nightscream,"A bit more cutesy than"" Kindergarten Cop, ""but more family-friendly, and Vin Diesel shows his versatility.",7,2 March 2005,"In brief: ""A bit more cutesy than ""Kindergarten Cop,"" but more family-friendly, and Vin Diesel shows his versatility.""I don't usually attend screenings for kids' movies, but when I first found out about this film, I was very curious to see how Vin Diesel would do in a kid's film. I've liked Vin Diesel ever since ""Pitch Black"", and while some may dismiss him as a muscle-bound action workhorse, I've long thought that there was more to him lurking behind that facade, and remembering the skepticism that greeted Arnold Schwarzenegger's attempts at comedyskepticism that was greeted with what I thought were successful turns in ""Twins"" and ""Kindergarten Cop"", I was curious to see how successfully Diesel would play against type.The result is a family film more cutesy and farcical than ""Kindergarten Cop"", (the model my mind kept going back to for comparison), with an unfortunately greater focus on infant waste products, but greater conflict between Diesel and his young charges, which lends itself to more heartwarming moments of rapport-building. Diesel plays Lt. Shane Wolfe, a Navy SEAL assigned to protect the five children of a top scientist (Tate Donovan), and find a hidden computer program that may be secreted in his house while their mother (Faith Ford) and Wolfe's C.O. journey to Zurich to try and find the right code word for the scientist's safety deposit box. A simple assignment, it seems, except these kids have issues. Eldest son Seth is defiant, suffers bullying from fellow students and the school's V.P., and is negligent in his wrestling team responsibilities. Oldest daughter Zoe (""American Dreams""'s Brittany Snow) is truant in her Driver's Ed class, and willfully disobedient. The problems of the youngest three, Lulu, Peter, and Tyler, seem simpler, but are no less mountainous for Wolfe, who first tries addressing these problems with the roughshod military discipline he's accustomed to, but soon finds himself changing tactics by listening to these kids' problems, and helping them out more as a parent than a military bodyguard. Whereas Schwarzenegger's character was instantly ingratiated with the object of his protection in ""Kindergarten Cop"" by becoming friends and eventually boyfriend to his mom, and merely had to win his class' attention, here Wolfe has the more difficult task of cutting through the layers of resentment in a pair of teenagers, taking care of an infant and two young children, and protecting them from assassins that come crashing through windows, which lends itself to both some genuinely warm moments when he opens up to Seth and Zoe, and some surprisingly interesting but funny action sequences that seem evocative of Jackie Chan, with a really nice setup-and-payoff when Wolfe realizes the secret to getting to the computer program.This is obviously a film geared more for the kids, as evidenced by the kooky overacting, the silly Swiss stereotypes (which I didn't even realized existed), and the goofy actions on the part of the bad guys, such as the revelation, for example, that squirting a juice box into a bad guy's face is akin to spraying it with acid (and somehow keeps the bad guy from falling backward in response), but while that may be a let-down to the older folk, the parents will probably be pleased, since I recall some parents being upset with the more adult scenes in ""Kindergarten Cop"". The bottom line is, bring the kids to see it, but if unless you're a die-hard Diesel fan, and want to see anything he does, it probably won't be your cup of tea if you're past grade school.",The Pacifier

The movie starts out with a tough mean looking navy seal whose assignment is to 'babysit' some children. he must do this because the father holds very important information and he has been kidnapped. the mother must go away for a few days and so Mr. Shane Wolfe (vin Diesel) is stuck with a babysitting job. and of course after a few days Shane gets used to handling the teens and diapers and toddlers in the household.... This is a fun filled adventure good for the whole family! 6/10 the movie grossed over 110 million dollars so those who plan to buy it I encourage you thanx,tornadopark",The Pacifier
103,Craig87-1,"Typically Disney, For Better Or For Worse ... Perhaps Worse",6,10 September 2009,"'The Pacifier' is a typical example of how Hollywood studios make family picture these days, in this case Disney and Spyglass. Get a star, throw in some actions (use car and kung-hu), add some jokes (slapsticks or toilet humour), and have some special appearances of celebrities or Oscar nominees, or if you can't, at least get some cute kids. Director? No matter. Just do it before someone else does it for this spring season. It is true that 'The Pacifier' is made with run-of-the-mill formula, but it does not follow that the film is not enjoyable. I actually smiled a lot, and the idea of putting muscular Vin Diesel (as Lt. Shane Wolfe from US Navy) in the dysfunctional family as body guard from underground organization is not bad. And as to the jokes, there are plenty of them, and the clever duck is also funny to see. Another good thing about the film is some of the relative newcomers. Among the kids, Morgan York playing precocious little girl Lulu is a real find. The director must have known it, for the film spends considerable time in showing her character. Surely his decision is justified. But there is something I do not like about the film. Though the death(s) are not directly shown, they are suggested, and the family who need Vin's protection in fact suffer from the death of the father. Isn't that unnecessary in making family pictures? In addition to this, there are many ill-advised decisions. Now let me count, 1) bullying wrestling coach (Brad Garrett) who is simply there to be despised 2) Helga, babysitting lady with intentionally heavy accent played by Carol Kane who looks like coming from 'The Addams Family' and 3) the 'ninja' idea which should have been dead back in the 80s. Oh, and 4) the suddenly introduced ""love interest"" (school principal played by Lauren Graham) for Vin Diesel, which is far from convincing. But the best way to describe the quality of 'The Pacifier' is to take a look at the CV of director Adam Shankman, which who has done J-Lo's unremarkable romantic comedy 'The Wedding Planner,' sweet but melodramatic 'Walk to Remember' and 'Bringing Down the House' so-so Steve Martin comedy. They are all commercially successful, but there are nothing particularly outstanding about them. Though it is fun to see, 'The Pacifier' does not change my impressions about his films.",The Pacifier

Now granted, it is lame and predictable, but still, it ends up funny and charming. Vin Diesel isn't that bad at all, and the rest of the cast does fine as well. There are also, a lot of funny bit parts in it as well, mainly, the school's vice-principle. There are a lot of funny physical things in this movie to keep everybody amused. And for you ladies out there, Vin Diesel in tight T-shirts should be enough to keep it interesting.

But, this film went overboard, to the point the the acting was beyond cartoonish.It seemed like every shot in the movie, was just a ""gag"" shot done for a TV ads, movie trailers, and talk show appearances by the star. There's no explanation for why people behave certain ways. The first half of the movie, the actors to even approach being human.Clearly, there was no single person, who edited this film. It felt like it was shot by multiple people, and patched together. A few parts near the end seemed slightly funny and slightly human. But, that was it.",The Pacifier

I like Vin Diesel, but the Kindergarten Cop he's trying to be neither seems badass enough nor comical enough. It's just flat. In a movie like this if it ditches realism than it has to be funny enough to make up for it. But what it delivers is plain ridiculous with both the ""special-op"" side being unreal and the family side being unfunny. I genuinely think Big Mama's House (the first one) was MUCH funnier than this. And I'm not even black mind you. Even thou the covert-op in that movie was unrealistic, the family situations and some suggestive grownup humor were actually funny.

107,legolas1337,"SEALs, prepare to be insulted.",1,21 May 2006,"This movie is funny in its own way. It's sort of ""Plan 9"" funny. Everything in this movie is garbage. The plot is absolutely ridiculous and more contrived than anything I've seen in a while. The movie starts out with lieutenant Shane Wolfe (Navy SEAL) briefing his squad on a mission to reclaim a kidnapped scientist. The last line in Wolfe's speech is ""We are SEALs, and this is our job!"" They eventually blow up a boat and a helicopter and go on a jet ski chase (which real SEALs would NOT do) before rescuing Dr. Plummer. Dr. Plummer is killed when he wants to call his wife and kids, and Wolfe gets hit with a bullet in the stomach. Two months later, he is asked to baby-sit the Plummer kids and search for Dr. Plummer's ""Ghost"" program while their mom goes to Zurich to open Dr. Plummer's safe deposit box. The kids hate Wolfe, and Wolfe hates them, which leads to very idiotic situations.The rest of the plot is rubbish. He doesn't do much searching for ""Ghost,"" and he constantly leaves kids alone by themselves. There are plenty of dirty diaper jokes, but they are not the most inappropriate. The most inappropriate joke in the movie is when one of the young Plummer children ask Wolfe about his ""boobs."" I was disgusted by this scene.Overall, the script sounds like it was written by dirty eight-year-olds, Diesel was wooden, the plot was horribly contrived, product placement (like Huggies and Imation) makes an appearance, and it is inaccurate to real life (i.e. Wolfe introducing himself to everybody as ""lieutenant Shane Wolfe, Navy SEAL."") This movie should never have seen the light of day. I only laughed at Wolfe's ""we are SEALs"" line because of how stupid it was. Not only is this movie stupid, it is also vulgar. Not appropriate for children, who were the targeted audience.Rating reasons- Blowing up stuff, bloodless shooting, threats at gunpoint, stupidly rude jokes.",The Pacifier

I just got back from viewing this movie with 7 adults and 11 children. It was wonderful to watch the kids giggle and hurrah at Vin Diesel, tough guy, nice guy, real softie routine. Whether he was kicking bad guys or changing diapers, he was great. While there were many clichés and material we've all seen in other forms, we sometime forget that this stuff works. My child is 8 and this is fresh to him. I'm so please that we were able to bring 18 people of varying ages who all had a good time.

It was decent movie that allowed Schwarzenegger to parody the ""Terminator"" image he had established up to that point. After 14 years, it's time for Disney to recycle that premise and now that Arnie's the governor of California, they've hired Vin Diesel to take his spot.""The Pacifier"" begins with Navy S.E.A.L. Shane Wolfe (Diesel) leading a rescue operation to save the life of an important computer scientist, Howard Plummer. The operation goes wrong, leading to the death of Plummer and disgrace to Wolfe.Plummer had been working on a computer program that can shut down missile defense systems on demand. The government suspects that the program is inside of a safe deposit box in Europe, so Plummer's wife Julie (Faith Ford) heads there and Wolfe is assigned to protect her five kids.The five children are: punk-rocker Seth (Max Theriot), frilly drama queen Zoe (Brittany Snow), sweet and occasionally lewd Lulu (Morgan York), rambunctious toddler Peter (twins Keegan and Logan Hoover), and baby Tyler (twins Bo and Luke Vink). In the most usual turn of events, Wolfe doesn't like the disorder of the household and the Plummer children don't like him. Wolfe also clashes with the European nanny.After the nanny quits, making sure the kids get to school on time and changing the baby's diapers become another of Wolfe's tasks. Wolfe uses his military training and know-how to instill some discipline on the children. In return, the kids teach him a thing or two about life.Lauren Graham plays the role of school principal and former naval officer, providing Wolfe with a love interest. I guess ""Gilmore Girls"" wasn't doing enough for her career.Unfortunately, the movie is not much better than the lame plot. Writers Thomas Lennon and Ben Garant, who brought us the Jimmy Fallon bomb ""Taxi"", must have thought of as many clichés as they could to stuff into this film. I guess they thought including a duck that acts like an attack dog would cover the originality aspect.Director Adam Shankman (""Bringing Down the House"") doesn't bring anything to the mix either. The situations that are put on screen are occasionally funny, such as one involving Lulu and her girl scout friends beating up malevolent boy scouts using some newly acquired Karate skills. However, most scenes that could have had these kinds of laughs fall short.The acting in the film is mediocre at best. I think Diesel might be better than the material. (I actually thought he did a decent job in ""The Chronicles of Riddick."") The kids aren't too bad either. York, playing Lulu, delivers a small punch in her lovable role.""The Pacifer"" is one of those movies that anyone over the age of nine will feel insulted after watching it.

Its the typical story of a soldier type person who makes a fatal mistake, resulting in the death of an important scientist. Due to this, it is up to Vin Diesel to look after the man's children, though they don't make it easy for him. It is Diesels job to ensure the children come to no harm from anyone whilst he is looking for the work of the murdered father. This film shows how the relationship between navy SEAL and child is formed. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and cannot wait to see it again. Once it comes out on DVD and video, I'm getting it.

Since the sound is piped in, there's no way to avoid experiencing the movie of their choosing. Anyhow, I did my best to make some observations about the movie. What can be glaened from a movie starring Vin Diesel, icon of bald knuckleheads everywhere? ""Adam Shankman"" must be a bad director's pseudonym, like ""Allen Smithee"". Consequently, I'm wondering if there's a ""bad producers"" pseudonym, and whether Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum have considered using it. Generally speaking, I don't mind the playing of movies on the bus, as even some of the worst movies tend to help the time pass. Unfortunately, the Pacifier had the opposite effect. For the duration of the movie, I heard maybe one or two stifled bouts of laughter, and that may have been from the clearly insane person riding the bus (there's always one). Anyhow, some months ago, I recalled that the METRO, not exactly the pinnacle of journalism, concluded that this movie ""Just Sucks.""

I would definitely give this movie a 10/10 as it is he best movie i have seen in a long time. Probably the only bad thing about this movie is that the ending is a bit mushy which is a let down after all the witty humour that is heard throughout the rest of the movie but even that wasn't enough to bring down my ratings.

Brad Garrett and Morgan York (Lulu) were hilarious. I was skeptic about Vin Diesel being a babysitter but it worked out well and he wasn't really that bad, he was actually pretty good for the part. Gary the Duck wasn't in the movie that much but he added a nice touch( another rhyme that wasn't on purpose) after all he did save the day.

Everything in the middle is sometimes scene for scene a remake of Uncle Buck, particularly when he goes to the school to meet the principal because the kids are having problems in school. There's even a very subtle connection they expanded in this film as the vice principal in Uncle Buck was a Navy vet and in this film the principal is the Navy vet. The only thing they switched is that in both films the vice principal was an antagonist but in this film (because Diesel's character is also Navy, the vet becomes a love interest).

Cue wackiness!The Good: Hey, it's funny! Which is strange, since I went into it expecting extreme lameness at every turn. Which, yah, it had a share of jokes that fell flat and stuff that just didn't really work, but the good, honest laughs in it far outweighed the bad.Vin Diesel does well in his role . . . but then he's been playing the badass character for a while, so it's nothing really new for him. He's taken well to the humor aspect also. He managed to pull off a harried super-disciplinarian quite well.The children are all great, too. The little ones are especially adorable. And the connection that's forged between all of them feels quite genuine and touching.The harness that Shane wears throughout the movie is awesome. Military meets soccer mom . . . I like it.The Bad: Not original in the least. Seems like hardly anything is nowadays. There are a number of jokes that are recycled directly from other movies of this type, even. Maybe not done as well as in this one, but still. And the story moves along pretty much as one would expect. They were obviously trying to be predictable and comfortable as possible . . . this is a family flick, after all.The beginning of the movie (the first fifteen to twenty minutes, I'd say) moves EXTREMELY FAST, jumping from one bit to the other at almost breakneck speed. The movie is pretty long as it is (I didn't keep exact track or anything, but surely it can't possibly be 91 minutes!), so I'm guessing that this is because a lot of cuts were made, and most of them were concentrated up front. The main problem with this is that there's a real difficulty feeling anything concerning the family's loss until much later in the movie. Up to that later point, there's just sort of a sense of ""Eh, so what?""There's some cops that show up at the end. And . . . well, they don't really do anything. Seemed like the filmmakers just had some budget padding they wanted to liquidate right quick.The Deal: Virtually everything about this movie - from the story to the characters on down - hits its target demographic right on the mark. It's a perfect flick if you want to bundle up the kids and the spouse and head out for a fun couple of hours. And even if you don't have kids or a spouse, check it out anyway.

Vin Diesel did a great job of making the movie believable, and it was fun watching Diesel learning to handle kids (something the parents in the audience were laughing hilariously about) and it was interesting to see who the bad guys were, even though it wasn't too hard to figure out. This movie will never be nominated for Best Picture of the Year, but we just need some fun stuff to watch every once in awhile, and this was fun.

It is just not convincing from Vin Diesel. I felt sorry for Lauren Graham; she just seemed so out of place to me, and her character's ""romance"" with the lead was, it seemed, just suggested and its development implied.A big saving grace was Lulu (Morgan York); she was utterly adorable, and seemed a decent actress out of proportion to her age. Of course, being cute, she DID get a somewhat disproportionate amount of screen time. Speaking of which, the oldest boy was ANNOYING! Surly/sulky to best friend/happy in record time? Impressive. Not.As for plot, well, there WAS one, and pretty simply laid out and predictable. The minute I saw the commanding officer, I KNEW he was actually the villain.

Faith Ford's bad acting, the perfectly put-together slim mother of 5, and Faith Ford's extremely bad acting.The rest of the actors serve as a reminder that actor's unions still have some power since if they were replaced by mannequins no-one would have noticed.This movie could have been a funny family movie instead it is a wooden dud which fools the audience and leaves a bad taste in their mouths'.",The Pacifier

We all know how these types of people end up in comedies *cough*Schwarzenegger*cough*, with minimal laughter and the such, but this movie has none of that.There really isn't much I can say about the movie since it is one of those gems that you have to see to appreciate as the previews are completely misleading.If you enjoyed ""Bringing Down the House"", you will love this.",The Pacifier

Vin Diesel is dreadful in most of his movies, but I could not bear to watch him in this drivel. The plot is thin, and totally predictable.All of the cast look uncomfortable and slightly embarrassed by the whole thing, except Diesel who woodenly performs throughout.Vin Diesels only redeeming factor in any movie is that he looks the part in an action movie, however, this was a poorly though out attempt to get him into comedy roles. Stick with the action movie's, Vin, and try and sign up for non speaking parts, like Arnie!It didn't even keep my kids amused.AVOID at all costs!",The Pacifier

I remember going to see this film in 2005, I was about eight or nine and I nearly fell off my seat laughing. It's a great film to watch with your family . It is still one of my favourite comedies. I would recommend it to people of all ages . I must watch it again sometime. I haven't watched in about 5 or 6 years . The cast is brilliant couldn't have picked better . I would rate this film 10/10 100%. I loved it very much brings back many memories with my mother and I laughing our heads off . Good times , good times .

133,nikajan,Family fun,8,22 June 2005,"Critics may not rate this film, and I have to admit that when I saw the posters for The Pacifier, I wrote it off completely, not being much of a Vin Diesel fan. Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised when I actually watched this. The script is genuinely laugh out loud funny, and Vin Diesel pulls off the act surprisingly well. Forget the critics for a few hours and let yourself enjoy this film. It is a great piece of light-hearted fun, and doesn't pretend to be anything else.Sure, you'll find a few clichés and stereotypes, but the film has an extra spark which lifts it. Not least is the chemistry between Diesel and the children. Most parents will be able to sympathise with the trouble the children give him initially, and most of us can remember pulling similar tricks as children. In a way, this film is a breath of fresh air. Unpretentious and tongue-in-cheek, it doesn't rely too heavily on special effects, and is not too earnest. Among the mixture of thought provoking films and utter drivel that has been produced recently, it is refreshing to find and entertaining film that is not too emotional and yet avoids coming across one-dimensional trash.",The Pacifier
134,xankriegor,I was not expecting this at all,10,9 March 2005,"The Pacifier looks like the same old story about the tough guy (played by a very tough Hollywood actor) who has to take care of kids, and while doing it, falls in love with them as they touch his heart. It started with Arnold in Kindergarten Cop 15 years ago, it happened last month with Ice Cube in Are we there Yet?, and again last week with Tommy Lee Jones in Man of the House. Now it's Vin Diesel's turn, and against the odds, the result is very positive. It's the story of NAVY SEAL Shane Wolf (Vin Diesel) who's working on an assignment to protect the kids of a recent killed scientist, whose secret experiment it's somewhere in the house, and so the bad guys are going to try to get it. A simple, not relevant story that doesn't hurt the movie at all. What matters are the funny situations the kids get Vin Diesel into, and they are funny.It mostly revolves around the school, where the two teens, Zoe (Brittany Snow) and Seth (Max Thieriot) are having problems at school, with her coping with her father's death and the classic school jocks making him miserable.We then have middle schooler Lulu (Morgan York) who's having problems with her Girl Scouts, and finally Peter and the nameless Baby who don't actually have any problems at all other than needing help to go to sleep or having their diapers changed. Morgan York was my favorite of the kids. She has the funniest and most fun scenes, as well as the better chemistry with Vin Diesel. Brittany Snow started kind of annoying but she then had an awesome crying scene that was truly great.Vin Diesel himself was great too, funny and also serious and touching when needed.Brad Garrett plays the school's Vice Principal and he's got some very funny parts as Vin Diesel's nemesis (in the not serious part of the movie). Lauren Graham plays the school Principal and Vin Diesel's love interest and she's great too.I have to say I was not expecting this at all, I was even trashing the movie before I got into the theatre, but the performances were all good, the comedy was all good (with some very funny stuff happening at all times in the background) and it all made for a really great family movie. 7/10",The Pacifier

137,oumom10966,Cute but predictable,7,10 July 2005,"This was finally a movie I felt comfortable taking my 7 year old nephew to see. Yes, it was predictable, but it was well worth getting over that part in the plot and getting down to the nitty-gritty of it! Having Vin act so ""human"" was a nice change. Even though his character had been disgraced in the military, he pulled himself up and rose to the challenge of his new assignment. His personality was great in this movie, and my nephew really liked the duck! That was his favorite character! I enjoyed the side plot with Vin's character and the principal. She was pretty and they made a great couple. It was amazing to see my nephew react to the way Vin's character seemed to know how to talk to each of the kids in their own way. He seemed to accommodate them with just a little work, meet their needs, and even some of his own, as well as making his stay with them so much better. Was there a message in that somewhere for all adults?",The Pacifier
138,cactusjump,Disappointing,1,11 July 2005,"This movie had such good potential - a huge action star like Vin Diesel is a navy seal and his next assignment goes completely against his instincts. I even was able to tolerate Diesel's acting. But then the storyline became overly-predictable, and utterly nonsensical. I am so disappointed by the wasted potential of this movie, it makes me angry.Faith Ford's character as the mother was bizarre. She did not do anything that a real mother would do in this situation. The romantic connection between the principal and Diesel seemed like an after-thought. And it was so insane that Diesel could completely take over the nanny job after a couple bad incidents. If you're looking for a fish-out-of-water type story with kids, check out ""Kindergarten Cop."" After all, that's what this movie is trying to imitate anyway.",The Pacifier
139,pablo_87ca,"Don't Listen To The Critics, This Was A Great Movie....See It And Make Your Own Mind Up....",10,27 March 2005,"This movie has been knocked by a few critics, and for whatever reason they felt the need to. I don't know why they praise sequels to movies that should have ended the first time around, but for economic reasons....Hollywood rehashes trying to get that extra buck. ""The Ring Two"" is not ""Star Wars"", or the ""Chronicles of Riddick"", and therefore hopefully should not necessitate a sequel. But for some reason this movie is getting some bad press, and the others will in some degree, be glorified in the press. Anyways, enough of that rant, this movie was a good movie, for any age group. It's a good laugh for the parents, and the kids. Vin Diesel did a tremendous job, as well as the rest of the ensemble. This movie was at points sometimes a bit predictable, but not in a bad way. Besides, just about any movie in this genre is predictable, and really with this type of plot, all movies are helplessly predictable without trying. This wasn't ""Saw,"" so lighten up people, on the plot twists and surprises!!!! This movie has a really good message, and manages to entertain in the process, what's so bad about that? Don't listen to the critics, and judge for yourself, make up your own mind. Anyone with half a heart won't be disappointed with this movie, and the predictability is very minimal. The only predictability is the critics' ability to be anti-social and secluded, and have no plans on Friday nights except to crucify every Vin Diesel movie that comes out. The funny thing is, is that if he ends up doing a Scorcese or Spielberg movie in the next few years, it will be hailed as a ""Masterpiece"" or ""Film Of The Year-A Must See!"" Make up your own minds people. See the Pacifier, and support a good movie.",The Pacifier

It was nice seeing him in something other than an action flick.I'll try not to give away to many spoilers. But the movie was about how I thought it would be. Typical Disney. It was pretty predictable. Although there was a twist near the end I didn't see coming! And I admit I cried during the heart to heart ""It's OK to miss your Dad"" talk.For the ladies, there is a shower scene followed immediately by him in a towel. Unexpected but very much appreciated!

The movie remains funny throughout from the second that Wolfe (Diesel) meets the Plummer kids to the ending which I won't spoil.A lot of people I've heard talking about Vin Diesel say he can't act but in this film I found him funny, he plays the role well, he is supposed to be a tough as nails SEAL that doesn't know how to look after kids, which is what he came across as to me, so I see a lack of failing on his behalf.There are some truly comic moments in this film and a decent set of mini plots to keep us watching and interested the whole time.If you haven't seen it and are just going by other people saying its a bad film I'd rent it out and have a watch, it may not be everyones cup of tea but it kept me and my girlfriend laughing the whole time.",The Pacifier

All my friends say that the movie is the bomb! i love this movie more than others because if you feel down or even just bored this is a great movie to see. i really think that everyone should see that movie just because it will brighten you if you have lost someone in your family like a mom or a dad because it really expresses that in the movie! i would never mind seeing this movie over and over again just because i loved it and i suggest for everyone that is reading this to see the movie especially if you have lost anyone in your family.,The Pacifier
145,abortionjizz,Vin diesel you owe me $10,2,2 April 2005,"I sneaked into this movie and i still feel like Vin Diesel owes me $10. I feel really sorry for anyone who actually paid money for this. It feels like a movie that was turned down by Arnold Swarzenegger 10 years ago.This was a pure formula movie. The writers should be ashamed of themselves, unless they got paid major $$$$$. If someone paid me 1 million dollars i would be willing to write a script like this one, hell i'll even act in it.(Diesel..though he probably got paid 10 mil. So i forgive you) If you want a movie to heckle and laugh at this is the one. I'm really sick of stupid movies where the villains are complete idiots. 1 minute their doing crazy karate jump kicks and the next their tripping over car bumpers. What the hell is wrong with Hollywood? Cant we think of better jokes. I heard someone laugh in the theater, and then i laughed at them. There was not even another chuckle(besides me and my friend. Although we were laughing cause we thought it would be funny if Vinny beat the hell out of the kids) He didn't, but i would have rated the movie better if he had. I'd like to see another movie like this that has a twist ending where the entire family gets killed by assassins and then the main protagonist kills himself. That would be entertaining. P.S. Vin Diesel, stop making bad movies. You were good in saving private Ryan and pitch black. Start picking movies with a good script not a good check.",The Pacifier

And finally, we have Vin Diesel who some may consider the greatest actor of the year 2005, nay the century, nay human being, nay ever.

I would definitely recommend this movie to people, but mostly younger people or people that have children. What I would also recommend is that people who are very judge mental should probably not watch this movie because there may be some offensive comments threw out of it, such as sexism, and maybe a bit of racism depending on how you take it.

Vin Diesel who I knew was a good actor in xXx really does a good job playing the baby-sitter. I would recommend this film for people who want to relax before a movie which is not too complicated but which has got friendly characters in it. As for the music, I found it cool.

149,joyoung77-68-997876,"Great Little Film, underrated",9,3 August 2014,"I won't go into the somewhat incredible plot line here, but will say that this movie is an underrated gem. Vin Diesel plays his role to perfection and all the kids are solid in their roles as well. For adults the movie is sort of silly, and anyone who knows anything about Navy SEALS isn't going to believe he was assigned to babysitting duty, but for kids this movie is a classic. My daughter must have seen it, oh, a few dozen times and therefore, for sheer entertainment value alone, it was worth buying the DVD. The truly great thing about the film is how it shows that children & teens are capable of doing things they don't believe they can and that with adult support and guidance they can achieve whatever they want to achieve. Notice I said, 'adult,' not parental. Vin Diesel is acting as a parental substitute but he's also every martial arts teacher, play director and driving instructor who ever lived. He also shows that you can be firm yet not abusive in raising kids, and that respect and discipline of one's self is paramount, which coming from Vin Diesel's persona is a powerful message.Aside from the affirmation of adults as teachers and role models, and the ""You Can Do It!"" shout out to kids, there's also the indelible vision of Vin Diesel doing this Peter Panda song and dance routine. But even that is proof that if you love someone, you'll do all sorts of crazy things for their happiness - and sometimes the payoff will be greater than you ever imagine.",The Pacifier

The rest of the family are so non-descript that even in character Vin can't remember their names, there were times towards the end of the film when I wondered who the children were only to realise they were the kids that hadn't actually had any lines yet It did seem that most of the children were put in there just to make up the numbers for the code at the start of the film, after that they were just told to sit there to take up screen room. The kid which is meant to be a great singer was so flat and monotone I was willing to rip out my eyeballs just so I had something to shove in my ears so I didn't have to hear it. The film seems to have had a checklist of all the stereotypical people and situations and went through them one by one, nasty Vice Principle, check, nice caring Principle, check, bullying situation, check, party situation, check, nasty nappy changing, check, love interest, check, chase scene, checketc, etc.. This is a one joke film, and the joke is putting an actor in a position against the norm and expecting us to laugh. The trouble is, with comedies like that you need an actor who has actually had a decent acting career so there is something to make fun of, and unfortunately Vin Diesel doesn't.",The Pacifier

I was laughing from the beginning of the movie and found that Vin comes across as a real person, not just some action hero.

Someone who does crazy stunts and is wild. Well you wouldn't think of him as a babysitter would you??? Well in 'the Pacifier' Vin Diesel IS a babysitter. At first the kids don't like him, and really he doesn't like them either. So it takes some time for everyone to get used to each other.

I realize this kind of movie is not intended for my age group (not unless accompanied by a youngster), but still - you have to maintain a certain level of professionalism when making a movie under a known company's logo no? Actually, here's the plot to the film - you'll see what I mean: The film tells the story of a navy seal commander who is assigned to guard duty over a family of 5 children, while their mother goes to Switzerland to recover a national security device developed by her husband in their house. (HA!) It's Kindergarten cop kinda ripoff, with a 'Sounds of Music' theme to it (5 kids, 1 adult - they all learn a valuable lesson...) I actually noticed Vin Diesel had a certain look on his face during some absurd scenes as if to say 'what the heck am I doing here?' (Especially during that stupid Panda dance...) Stay away.

It was with a severe sense of dread that I started watching it, and the first 15 minutes did nothing to alleviate the fear. After that though, I found myself chuckling along and finally laughing out loud. The Pacifier was pretty good, complete with action sequences, satisfying paybacks, and some minor twists. Even the love interest wasn't overdone. Vin Diesel seemed to have a great time poking fun at himself. While not the best movie on the planet, if you think the idea of Vin Diesel really hamming it up sounds even remotely funny, you will be happily surprised.

155,skeeterchicakb83,Pacifier - good family fun,9,5 December 2005,"I recently watched ""The Pacifier"" with my entire family and we were all pleased to see Vin Diesel in a film other than where he does the normal action film. I liked those films, but this is the one that I really love. As Lt. Shane Wolfe, Diesel does an admirable job. He is uncomfortable at first in a father figure role - being more at home and comfortable shooting things. However, the kids begin to win him over (and the ninja scenes will give those looking for action something to cheer on). Diesel does an admirable job as the rough and tough father figure type, with more than enough understanding to win the kids over and to help them with more than just keeping them safe. Anyone could do that, but it takes a special person to help kids get over losing a parent. Diesel does that well. Diesel shows more depth than just someone who likes to shoot things. He allows himself to look ridiculous (like in the Peter Panda dance), yet stands up for himself when Murney is being an idiot. The rapport that he and the kids share is evident both on screen and off (in the DVD extras you can see his interaction with them as someone who genuinely loves kids). I thought that this was a wonderful step for Diesel to take. It showed that not every role has to be 'bad ass'. There is room for love too. It may start out weird, but if you try (as Diesel does) then it works. One word about the child actors - they do a wonderful job. They start out as being brats, but when they realize that Shane is really there to help them and to keep them safe (and that he really does care), they open up to him. It was really touching to see a real family with real problems work them out on screen. Lauren Graham and Brad Garrett were wonderful. Lauren does a great job NOT being Lorelai Gilmore (although she is wonderful as that too) and Garrett is hilarious. Where they got that international wrestling singlet, I don't know, but he was... funny. The DVD extras are almost worth more than the movie. There are things that detail Brad Garrett, as well as letting you see Vin Diesel off set as a wonderfully nice guy. What a pleasure. This movie is worth whatever you pay for it. I can't wait to add it to my collection.",The Pacifier
156,SHuntsman122254,Fun for the family!,10,3 April 2006,"The Pacifier was an excellent movie full of fun for the family. The actors were well cast for all the parts! Vin Diesel was the perfect combination of fierce and gentle. He comes on strong and stays strong to the end, but also shows compassion. He is funny even in scenes where his reactions are perhaps a bit overplayed as when he is discovered by the Fireflies in the Plummer kitchen. Lauren Graham couldn't have portrayed the Principal better! In the scene where Shane had just returned home from being down in the sewer system, Lauren's facial expressions were hilarious but very realistic at the same time. Casting Faith Ford as Julie Plummer was also a good pick. It takes a good actress to play the part of Julie Plummer, the wacky Mother of the Plummer clan, and make her even a little believable. With it having only been a couple of months since her husband's death, Julie Plummer seemed to take things in stride way beyond the capacity of a normal human being. Faith Ford did an excellent job of blending the incredible with the believable. And thumbs up to Brittany Snow as strong willed independent Zoe Plummer! Whether she was angry at Shane for running off her boyfriend or in a panic during the Driver's Education scenes, her ability to express emotion proved her excellence in acting. Morgan York really stole the show with her crush on Shane Wolfe and the scene near the end of the movie where she gives him the picture so he won't forget her. And let's not forget Brad Garrett as Murney the ""murninator."" The script writers did well to include this ridiculous character. From getting caught by the Priciple calling it ""my school,"" to the wrestling match, and then finally being Mother Superior in the musical, Brad Garrett played his part with excellence! How can I end this without mention of Carol Kane as Helga, the Plummer nanny and housekeeper. From the gray roots of her hair and the irony of her having been a beauty queen, to her departure from the Plummer household, Carol Kane was the ultimate representation of all the Helgas we have known both in the movies and real life!

Vin Diesel plays a tough guy with a big heart, he just has to find it. In the process he helps to save the world and defeat the bad guys. The children playing the Plummer family work well together, you could believe that they could be a real family (problems and all). Lauren Graham plays the principal of the school and the ""love"" interest for Vin Diesel very well. Their attraction is ""cute"" but not overdone.

The transformation of Vin after his interactions with the children was very good.The action scenes were believable and not too harsh for younger children. I enjoyed the movie almost as much as my children. Some things like the mother rarely checked on her children and the superior officer in the army was the traitor were stretching it a little but it worked in the context of the plot.The work ethic that Vin displays in the show and his changing of diapers and bringing order to the children reminded me a little of what Julie Andrews did in the Sound of Music. They even sang a song for the mother when she got back home. It was a great show for kids and not too bad for their parents.,The Pacifier
160,jwvincent,Very good and entertaining,8,15 April 2005,Me and My wife both in our mid 50's were at our local shopping center and decided to take in a movie as we had just had dinner so we we choose this this one and we have not stopped laughing about this very enjoyable movie and would recommend everyone to go and see it and i can not wait for it to come out on DVD to add it it to my movie collection . It is a family movie and a good laugh it is good to sit down and watch a movie with out violence and we are both thinking of taking our grand kids to see it It is strange seeing Vin Diesel handles comedy as easy as he handles action movies . I enjoyed also Brad Garett as the school wrestling coach it is strange seeing him in a movie and not on TV as Raymonds Brother,The Pacifier
161,jnettle,It's a great family movie,7,5 March 2005,"If you're afraid to watch The Pacifier because you've heard that it's a lot like Kindergarten Cop, don't worry - there isn't much similarity. For one thing, Vin Diesel can act.Not every movie is made to be ""arty"" or win Academy Awards. Some of them are made to simply entertain families - and The Pacifier is one of them.Diesel's character is funny, the kids sound just like real kids (I'm a teacher, trust me!), and the plot twist at the end of the movie isn't telegraphed so far in advance that it turns out to be no surprise at all.Parents can take children of any age and be both entertained and unembarrassed. This movie is good clean fun and Vin Diesel is good in it.",The Pacifier
162,nicoleleilani,Fun!,9,26 February 2017,"Great movie to watch with my 9 year old son. Loved the Sound of Music tie-in, Vin Diesel is entertaining and has great ""boobies"". My son loved the poop humor and the Fireflies using taekwondo against the bullies. Lauren Graham is always lovely, the mom too and the brother from Everyone Loves Raymond! (Sorry I'm terrible with names!) fun family film. Highly recommend it.",The Pacifier
163,shellysn,Darn it - I liked it!,7,21 March 2005,"I think that this movie, contrary to what most ""critics"" are saying, is a great family film. I could hardly keep my seven-year-old in the seat he was so into it. What's wrong with going to see a movie that doesn't have a lot of bad language or sexual content with your kids and having a good time. Granted - this movie may not be truly realistic, but hey - it's a movie. If I want reality I'll watch the news.Vin does a great job and shows his versatility as an emotional actor and its fun! And, I am glad to see that it seems to be pleasing others as well.",The Pacifier
164,ziggy_zoggy,Best family film I've seen and the first action star to family comedy to pull it off successfully,8,8 March 2005,"Provided great action without going over the top and reaching an area where it could be deemed inappropriate.Interesting story lines keep you in to the movie.Pulled off great comedy without trying to force it out of Vin although Vin himself was very entertaining in his role.Great acting from Max Thieriot as Seth although he did get a little over dramatic in one scene. Probably the best action in the movie from it's deepest character. The only performer who's acting brought the movie down was Faith Ford as the mother she is not often put in position to hurt the movie too much.Vice Principal Murney was hilarious but his character gave the impression of a kid flick as his character was a pretty common character in a family movie. But he did the best performance of the inept educator I've seen since Max Keeble's big move.Really built the comedy around Vin using his character's personality and lifestyle to create humorous scene as opposed to trying to make him deliver the comedy which in other movies has really borough the quality down such as Hulk Hogan did to Mr Nanny.Although bearing some similarities to Mr Nanny and Kindergarten Cop I felt comparison was not warranted beyond preference and quality.Genuinely funny, something I haven't seen in a while.",The Pacifier
165,iamrachel,"Not necessarily an original, but still good",10,13 March 2005,"I wasn't planning on seeing this movie originally, because it looked just too cutesy--and despite my absolute love of Vin Diesel, I just wasn't in the mood. However, I finally did see it when my niece had the desire to see it, so I took her and was pleasantly surprised at the results. I'm not one to laugh out loud in theaters (I get embarrassed), but I was covering my mouth many times to keep from bursting into laughter. Some of it was because it was just strange to see Vin Diesel doing some of those things when I'm used to him in action films, but most of it was because there actually were cute and funny jokes in it. No, it's not the first time this story has been done (hello, ""Kindergarten Cop"" and hello ""Mr. Nanny"") but I didn't enjoy either of those movies as much as I enjoyed this one. Maybe it is because I like Vin Diesel better than Hulk Hogan or Ah-nold, but it was worth my money and my time, because I really ended up enjoying it. Be prepared for a little sappiness, be prepared for fart jokes, but also be prepared to sit back and try to enjoy. It was worth it.",The Pacifier
166,suluga,Surprisingly funny,7,21 March 2005,"I took my 3 kids, ages 4,6 and 8 to go see over the weekend and I was pleasantly surprised. I wasn't expecting much, I mean come on Vin Diesel is not the greatest actor, and I didn't take it too seriously. It held my kids attention through the whole movie. And mine for that matter. There are a lot of scenes I could relate to being a parent i.e. changing diapers, getting them to school on time, and other things that were done with humor. There were also a lot of references to farting, pooping, vomiting, and all the other stupid stuff kids think is so funny. All in all I would see it again on video. It was that entertaining.",The Pacifier
167,golfgrl988-1,good movie.,10,6 March 2005,"'The Pacifier' may not be the best movie out there, but it's a funny, well written and acted, comedy for the family. Vin Diesel was very amusing as Shane Wolf and it is a role you would not expect to see him in. All the kids were excellent and you could see that they all really bonded in the end. Yes, there were some cheesy and predictable jokes, but it was all fun. It is a Disney movie after all. But don't say it's horrible, because it's not. It was very entertaining and deserves a chance. I really liked this movie and thought that even though you knew some parts were coming, you still laughed at them and some parts even surprised me. Go see it and judge for yourself.",The Pacifier
168,xbutterfly1817x,Awesome,10,15 March 2005,"This movie was just amazing. I didn't stop laughing. I mean, you get everything in this movie...suspense, comedy, romance, and action. Not to mention Vin Diesel in a towel and just being a big softy with the children! Yeah, so this movie isn't for everyone, but I must admit, of all the movies I've seen with Vin in it, I personally love this one! He did an awesome job at acting and the storyline was great. Vin Diesel is just a hottie. And the kids in the movie, great acting job to all of them. One thing I didn't like was the police officers dropping their guns when told by the Korean spies and the Korean spies being a little too soft. But then again, it's a comedy and a PG-13 movie. I can't wait till the next Vin Diesel movie...he's sexy, did I mention that already?",The Pacifier
169,bdjpatrick,Crap!!!,1,7 March 2005,"All the funny parts are in the trailer. Vin Diesel cannot act and shouldn't try dialog. He needs to stick to action.... unbelievably awful. And how many dirty diaper jokes does the world need? We understand that changing a diaper isn't fun..... Faith Ford is wasted. The premise is stupid. A better family film would be PARENTHOOD with Steve Martin. A better afternoon with the kids would be a trip to the dentist, but I recommend a park... it's would be better for their heath. And if it does well, I expect Disney to make PACIFIER 2 because there are no more original ideas left in Hollywood. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.",The Pacifier
170,noahcole2,This movie is AWESOME!,10,24 March 2005,"This is a wonderful movie. I am a big fan of Vin Diesel, and am glad he played in a funny family movie like this. It is a good movie for adults and children both. The story line includes things that will interest everyone, a little drama, comedy, emotion, all rolled into one. I got a lot of good laughs. I would recommend anyone go see this. Shane, a navy seal, real tough guy, ends up ""babysitting"" a bunch of kids. Throw in a wrestling match with the wrestling coach, dancing for the kids, teaching one to drive, changing diapers, and falling for the kids principal. That is just some of the funny things Vin Diesel has going on in the movie. He ends up loving the kids and them loving him too in the end. (Looking at Vin Diesel was just an added bonus).",The Pacifier
171,hokicj,Great family flick,9,5 March 2005,"It's nice to be able to watch a movie as a family. It's extra nice to be able to watch a movie with the family without having to put my hands over my children's eyes or over their ears. By far, I think Disney has done an excellent job of bringing a movie that both the parents and children can watch (sitting though any Nick Jr. movies is too painful for the average adult!) I am also happy that Vin Diesel is coming in a movie where he has more than a total of 15 lines, and none of which contain any crude language. A++ for kids! Although I rank Riddick in my top ten, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie to see a different and more human side of him. While it's not a 10, it still ranks up there high enough to be in my collection when it comes out on DVD. Thanks Disney, and thanks Vin Diesel!",The Pacifier

That had to be the WORST movie I have ever seen. 100% cheesy, horrible acting, you can guess whats going to happen next in the classic Disney movie plot. Horrible horrible horrible movie. To think somebody is probably proud of making that movie. That was ridiculous. Vin diesel should feel ashamed for having been in that movie. Its so cheesy its funny thats how bad it was.

A must see for people who enjoy clean healthy entertainment.The Love portion of the movie is OK, but lulu stole the show. Zoe is funny in her role as the embattled teen trying to deal with her father's death and boys. Seth needs a father's direction in his achievement for acting.

His new assignment: Protect the five kids from enemies of their recently deceased father -- a government scientist whose top-secret experiment remains in the kids' house. I began to envy the deceased father as I watched this stupidity. Why was there absolutely no emotion or depth here at all? The concept is a good one but this movie flops right from the start. Vin Diesel is just horribly miscast and out of place. Unfortunately, this movie may make money because the grab at dumb kids and their parent's wallets is all that Disney is about these days.

But I was going for my son's enjoyment. Ironically, I was so impressed with this film, that I felt compelled to write comments on it, as you see here. As we were leaving the movie theater my 10 year old son said it was a ""well balanced movie, having comedy, action, and niceness"" as he called it. I agree with my son, it was well balanced. Vin Diesel did a very good job in this role. He made connections with the other characters and as a result this movie really stirred emotional chords of family, friendship, and even love, not to mention funny action, and entertaining events. Admittedly, I was even a bit choked up a couple of times. It was definitely way better than expected. I was impressed with this fun film and I came away liking Vin Diesel where before I still wasn't sure about him.",The Pacifier
177,pwjones57-1,Really liked it!,9,14 April 2005,"First of all, I am biased. I like Vin so much that he could stand on a rotating pedestal for 90 minutes and I'd deem his performance worthy of an Academy Award. OK, I'm kidding . . . a little! I fell in love with him when I saw XXX and sought to collect everything he had ever been in! I have EVERYTHING he has ever done, with the exception of ""Strays"", which is not available to the public. I even own ""Multi-Facial"", the independent short film he made in the '90's. Stephen Spielberg saw it and wrote Vin a part in his new film, ""Saving Private Ryan"". (WOW!)I think Vin has made a great crossover into comedy in ""The Pacifier"". I have seen him in interviews and recognized his comedic talents right away. I love the intro . . . so serious! I liked the prep for the mission, the segue into the plot and the interaction of the characters.I really liked the use of the children's toys as defense from the Ninja attack. Interlaced into the plot was a patriotic theme: defense of the country and Shane's disappointment with the older boy's assumed involvement in the Nazi movement.I was pleased with the action scenes, love between family members (eventually), and the fact that Shane was never shamed. He wasn't always right, but he was never WRONG. After seeing the true threat, the kids rallied around their hero. (Oh, how I'd love the chance to rally around him!!!) I WAS disappointed that the kiss at the end was SO SHORT!! I know it's a Disney film, but can't we see more than just a peck on the lips?Keep the movies coming, Vin!

178,pught,Great Family Movie!!,10,8 March 2005,"I took my 8 yr old to this movie and she laughed all the way through it! It was hilarious!! I've seen a few of Vin Diesel's movies and he's not the strongest actor, but he did a GREAT job in this movie. If you are looking for a good, clean, funny family movie then this is it. The only thing that might raise some eyebrows for parents of small children is in the beginning (first 5 minutes)there is a S.E.A.L. mission where there are a few explosions. I can't wait for this to come to video!! Shane Wolfe (Vin Diesel) is sent to protect the children of a scientist who was killed on Wolfe's mission to retrieve him. Wolfe has little experience with children. But he's about to get some!! The nanny quits shortly after he gets there. Wolfe's mission is to protect the Plummer children and find the project the scientist was working on (it's hidden somewhere in the house).

179,kmforbreeze,Military man watches family and changes them overnight.,2,11 March 2005,"I did not like this movie at all. My mom took me and my sister as a special treat on a Thurday night. The acting was really bad by all except the crazy nanny, and the mom. There was maybe one funny part, it just did not work at all. I really like Vin too, but he needs a better supporting cast, especially in a comedy. There was one scene in which the oldest sister gets really emotional over her fathers death. She actually did a great job, and Vin reacted good too. However so much of this movie was based on dirty diaper humor, which only can go so far. The dirty diaper in the chucky cheese balls was not funny at all. Only the dirty diaper on the car windshield was funny and unexpected. It seems to me that all the young actors these days are from another movie. The younger sister was also in cheaper by the dozen, and she wasn't great in that either. Why don't they take the time to look for talent instead of relying on people from another movie. It should do well in video sales though, all kid movies do.",The Pacifier

Vin Diesel is a fabulous actor that performed in other excellent movies, like Saving private Ryan, Pitch Black, The chronicles of Riddick. It is well know that he has great charisma, gifted with an impresive voice, as well as beautiful eyes and, yes, lets face it, great body (men like me envy that guy :P), and, most important, good acting skills. We've seen him in all kinds of scenes, but who could have imagined this though guy in the role of a babysitter?! This thought only, brings a smile on anybody that knows a little bit of Vin Diesel. He has to guard the children of a very important person that designed a special chip (called GHOST). Troubles come along, of course. Can't say more. Just watch it.

I liked it so much, I have seen it 3x already in a matter of two weeks. I am not at all the type of person who goes to the movie theater on a regular basis, let alone see a movie several times. I thought that this movie was excellent on several different levels.I think that it is good how they made the movie one that several different types of people could enjoy. I myself am 16 years old and as I said, I enjoyed it. I also went several times with friends/family of different age groups- 6, 14, 18, 25, and 40. Everyone that I saw it really enjoyed it, and agreed that they got they're moneys worth.I also liked the way they showed strong family values and morals. I learned a good amount from the movie, being 16 years old and dealing with some of the same issues mentioned in the movie.Most of all, after seeing the movie for the first time, I absolutely fell in love with Max Thieriot. I never really saw any of his movies until The Pacifier. I think that he is a really good actor- NOT TO MENTION HOW DAMN CUTE HE IS!! Especially with blonde hair... and I thought Haley Joel Osment was hot, uh! When the part came on where he revealed his love for acting- I thought I was going to M-E-L-T!

It was charming for me to see him in a not-so-action based role, and at that, one with children! It was so cute! Especially watching his character deal with diapers! This movie also possessed a lot of versatility- it was the perfect blend of men & action, women & love/drama, and kids & values. The ultimate in family night movie compromises that everyone will like!Also, it gave a good voice to a range of living issues from dealing with peers, teachers, and children, all the way to major issues like death of a loved one, or being an orphan.

The Plummer children were nothing but a collection of brainless clichés. Brad Garrett was the only thing remotely entertaining in this film. The rest of the film was just too painful to watch. Vin Diesel should really stick to action films and fire his Publicist. Avoid this film and go rent Kindergarten Cop instead.

186,acrylamide,ideology at its best?,8,19 May 2005,"i give this film an 8 for its ideological content. In short, what one learns from this movie is that modern American families need to be appropriately militarized and surveyed so that they can protect themselves against terrorists, which are everywhere, even right next door. the process of militarization at first incurs resistance, if not out right rejection, but, in the end, paternalistic militarization leads to the repair of family ties. furthermore, through a mixture of positive reinforcement and active aid, the paternalistic treatment of the militarized babysitter leads to the pursuit, nurturing and realization of the son's passion, something that the effeminate, ostensibly gay, drama teacher, nor the condescending wrestling coach, who, with a guise of hyper masculinity, seems to be making up for his impotence, were able to accomplish. contrary to what one may think, the betrayal of the babysitter by his superior is not a critique of militarization as such, but rather a proof of the necessity to always be on one's guard to detect, ward off, and defeat the traitors, who infiltrate or turn against, notably for profit, the pastoral mission that is to reside in the heart and the minds of every good patriotic guardian of the American nation. is this ideology at its best? welcome to disneyland. please check that our conscience is in your door. no make that floorboards, a coke, and an order of freedom fries...",The Pacifier

Just until you pass the first part of the film and he becomes Mr. Nice Guy! This really shows Vin Diesel for what he really is and not the usual bad ass guy. The transition from the big bad Wolfe, to the most wanted babysitter one can find is also great. Its just too good.

This movie showed the wonderful range of acting talent Vin Diesel has and shows the human and more personal side to his nature. When I first heard that he was doing a movie with a comedy side , I wondered if he could do it because all I had ever seen him in was action movies where he was the tough good guy/bad guy but I was pleasantly surprised.

For a production of this budget, the acting is plain awful. I cannot believe this movie got past the storyboard phase. VIn is not versatile.

196,OrionStorm,Good Family Movie ... A Refreshing Change for Vin Diesel,7,4 July 2005,"This is a really family, fun movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it. In the tradition of old fashioned Disney movies, its insightful, touching and down-to-earth humor.For Vin Diesel, its a very refreshing change from his previous action movies. I've enjoyed his work starting with XXX. With each movie he expands his depth of the character he portrays.With this role, playing with a group of children really demonstrates his versatility. This is a movie that I'd certainly love to see a sequel of. There are several possibilities with a variety of plot twists.This movie reminds me of the Spy Kids movies, in that its fun without being silly. Yet, still has excitement and fun. It plain and simple makes me laugh. Isn't that what a comedy movie is supposed to do?",The Pacifier
197,rainforestgirl02,One of the best movies I've seen,10,4 July 2005,"I loved this movie. It was one of the best I have ever seen. I am a Vin Diesel fan and I'm use to seeing him in action movies so I couldn't wait to see him in a family comedy.NAVY SEAL Shane Wolfe{Diesel}is assigned to watch 5 out of control kids after he failed to save their father, who was a scientist. The kid's mother has to go with Shane's commander to Zurich to get something that Howard Plummer{the scientist} left behind.While Shane is watching the kids he is looking for a program that Howard invented. Also while he there he ends up helping the kids with their problems. The oldest kid Zoe{Brittney Snow}is trying to pass driver's ed but isn't such a good driver and is also trying to be strong about their father's death for her siblings. The oldest son Seth{Max Thieriot} gets bullied around by kids at school and the vice principal {Brad Garret}. Middle child Lulu and her girl scout troop get bullied around by boy scouts. And the toddler and the baby don't really have problems.In this movie their are serious parts and funny parts. Their is a really serious part where for the first time in the movie Zoe talks about her dad. And tells Shane that she misses him.Their are some funny parts between Lulu and Shane and when Shane breaks down Seth's door.A great movie for the whole family. One of Vin Diesel's best. One of the things that really makes the movie great is the cast. Vin Diesel,Brittney Snow,Max Thieriot,Morgan York,Keegan and Logan Hoover,Bo and Luke Vink,Lauren Graham,Brad Garret,Faith Ford and Chris Potter.Hope you see this movie.",The Pacifier
198,IainMaddigan,No more Mr. Tough Guy,6,13 October 2015,"This was not one of Vin Diesels best movies. I enjoy his others just not so much this one. Saying that though, if you just sit back and watch this movie with no real expectations, you just might like it. A male babysitter is relatively unthinkable. Diesel excels in it. It's actually cute watching him with the kids. It's a cute movie for the kids. Families can sit back and all can enjoy it. Nice to see him drop the tough guy act and try to be a family man. Of course he comes in for the save but it wouldn't be his movie if he didn't. You even get to hear him sing. Sit back with your family and enjoy. Don't forget the family.",The Pacifier
199,cdemian,Inept and vulgar script (in an inconspicuous way),1,22 September 2005,"The script makes, through the character Helga, a terrible mistake, and it does it in a vulgar way. It is true that probably 99.99% of the people who saw the movie didn't even realize that.The script puts a couple of very vulgar Romanian words in the mouth of Helga, the babysitter, but later in the movie it is revealed that the character was a former Miss Czechoslovakia. Romania and Czechoslovakia have absolutely nothing in common, and this is probably the fundamental error in writing those lines. Convinced probably that people from Czechslovakia speak Romanian, the writer must have found someone who knew Romanian or at best thought so, because the two Romanian expressions, besides of being super-vulgar, were used in a wrong manner and incorrect pronunciation.I have nothing to say about the movie, since I literally shut it off after those lines. Sorry, but Americans still have a long way to find out there are lots of other people in the world but them.",The Pacifier
200,pistonsfan_4eva,Pacifiar,9,14 October 2005,"I thought this movie was great. It was a great family entertainment and summed up in the end. The kids were great and the acting was a blast. This is now my favorite movie, you should go see it yourself if you haven't already! Its great for all ages because i saw it with people in all different parts of ages and we all loved it. I love to just sit down on a Friday night and chill while watching a movie i rented, But when i watched this one, i couldn't chill. i was either laughing till i died, or or saying aw.But i was mostly laughing. Let me Tell you this. If your gonna go see it, make sure your prepared to laugh. you might not laugh as much as i did, i think everything is funny. Thanks for reading my comment!",The Pacifier
201,dcasey2976,"Good Job, Vin!",10,21 November 2005,"I'm not going to post a long entry, or even a spoiler - as the above statement says.All I'm going to say is I'm proud of Vin Diesel.Sir. Vince, as they say.It's not easy for a guy who's done all action movies to turn around and do a kids movie.And he played his part well - I ain't saying what happens in the movie, but he even still is kind of doing an action movie - just a Disney kids action movie.And there ain't nothing' wrong with that.In my personal opinion, Vin is a good actor anyway - he has the talent to play multiple parts, so why the heck not.And another thing - one person commented on him being like Arnold aka. Kindergarden Cop - in trying to make a switch...A person who makes this comment really has not looked at what this movie is about and who the actors are involved.Arnold was a one dimensional actor who had brawn.Vin is a multi-faceted actor who has brawn and brains.Big Difference!",The Pacifier
202,jki43455,The Best Comedy,10,28 December 2005,"Vin Deisel is the man in this film, The Pacifier Totally Rocks. If You haven't yet seen this movie I'd suggest you get your butt to the nearest Video Store & Rent or Buy a copy.My partner, kids & myself must have watched this film at least a dozen times & we are far from bored with watching The Pacifier, the rest of the cast are excellent.The start of the film is action packed & from there on just gets funnier & funnier, I would rate this film 10 stars for storyline, plot, acting & film direction.Vin Deisel is the man to also watch in The Fast & The Furious which is also an excellent film, another film to watch is Racing Stripes, if I was to choose between The Pacifier, The Fast & The Furious, Racing Stripes I would choose all three without hesitation.",The Pacifier
