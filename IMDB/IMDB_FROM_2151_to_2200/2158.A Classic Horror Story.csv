0,kosmasp,Mid Italian Sommar,8,25 July 2021,"Well not just that of course, although there is at least one scene that might remind you of that other movie. For better or worse (I really liked the other one, but you may feel differently) - but this is not just this one movie. It actually has so many horror tropes and cliches ... sometimes elevated and with a wink or two ... sometimes just plain bloody and violent mayhem.It does go quite meta (especially towards the end) and might even be or feel way to clever for its own good. That I will leave up to you to decide. Especially the ending after the ... ending. I like what they do and to me it feels like making fun of itself, rather than fun of the viewer ... well maybe a little bit of that too. Depends on what mood you'll be in and how you perceive it.Still while I don't feel this will become a cult, it is rather a clever take on a genre (with the multiple subgenres) ... not for the squeamish for sure.",A Classic Horror Story
1,Tweekums,Lives up to the title with references to many well know horror films,8,15 July 2021,"This film is centred on a group of five people who are carpooling in an RV on a trip to Calabria in southern Italy. While driving at night they swerve to avoid a dead animal in the road and hit a tree... when they awaken it is daytime, the RV is in a forest clearing and most strangely there is no sign of the road. In the clearing there is a somewhat sinister house. One of the five is badly hurt so stays in the RV, the two other men, a doctor and a young aspiring film maker head into the woods looking for the road but only find a macabre tableau featuring severed pigs' heads before ending up back where they started; the two girls who stayed behind enter the house and find odd pictures. Reunited the film maker tells them a dark story told by his mother; one about a strange murderous cult. It looks as if it was more than a story as a group of people in animal masks start to hunt them down for their sacrifices.The most obvious thing to say about this film is that it isn't afraid to reference other films in both style and content... 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre', 'The Wicker Man' and 'Friday the 13th' to name just a few. There is a really great atmosphere that makes the viewer sure that something bad is about to happen most of the time. When the bad things do happen they are mostly done in a way that doesn't show too much; cutting away at the last moment to convince any viewer who closed their eyes to avoid seeing something horrible convinced that it was shown. That isn't to say there is no gore. The characters are typical of those one tends to find in these films and the actors do a fine job bringing them to life while playing with horror stereotypes. Matilda Lutz, from the excellent French film 'Revenge', stood out the most. Inevitably for a modern horror movie there is a twist at the end; it isn't too obvious but when it comes one can think back to things said previously which can make one wonder why you didn't spot it sooner. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of somewhat unpleasant, naturalistic seventies horror.These comments are based on watching the film in Italian with English subtitles.",A Classic Horror Story
2,searchanddestroy-1,A classical slasher story too,8,16 July 2021,"But with a certain charm though, unusual and entertaining charm, maybe not fun, but good enough to retain your attention. Nothing exceptionnal however. Some lines may remind Dario Argento and the glorious Giallo era of the sixties and seventies, the Italian charm...With also a bit of WICKER MAN and B MM. Bloody charm and charisma. But now, the slasher genre is back, joining the zombie one for the horror fans. The ending is fairly good, the best part anyway of this film.",A Classic Horror Story
3,trashgang,nothing explained and weak ending but still worth seeing,8,13 August 2021,"I just thought, okay, with a title like that it's going to be a viewers trap. But after seen it I was rather surprised what a good flick it was.Okay, it do has a few things that aren't okay. Nothing is explained and. The ending is rather weak but in between it does deliver.Hated by many that I can do understand by its flows but did I love it. All things needed to make it good are involved, some twists in the story line. Gory effects here and there and some things you didn't see coming.Even as nothing is explained and the ending as I said is weak it surely is worth seeing.And to make it even a bit funny. Just watch it until the end credits. The makers do add some funny notes, which I do understand why they did it.Gore 2/5
Nudity 0/5
Effects 4/5
Story 2,5/5
Comedy 0/5.",A Classic Horror Story
4,arfdawg-1,Ich,2,17 July 2021,"Starts off promising but them it's all down hill with usees jabbering and no action.Odd thing -- they dubbed into English a fair amout of this movie. I'd rather have seen subtitles. Further they are out in the bookies but somehow get internet.OK, so a third into the movie -- 30 minutes in -- it gets incedibly violent.Then it gets marginally interesting.Think Blair Witch meets M. Knight Shayamalan without the talent.So anyway, right after it gets interesting, it gets boring again. It's just taht the basic premise is ok but the story realiztion sucks.SO now we're a bit more than half way thru the film and waiting for some action again. And about two thirds into it it comes. Also rather violent.Then it takes a turn. Not for the good. It's just rather stupid. A twist that is downright idiotic. Really. Just plainly stoopid.",A Classic Horror Story
5,jtindahouse,Masterfully crafted with great characters,9,18 July 2021,"Characters man. They are everything to the quality of a horror movie. If we don't like or care about your characters, how are we supposed to care what happens to them? So many get it badly wrong, however 'A Classic Horror Story' is not one of those films. Every one of them in this movie is great. Likeable, yet flawed. Funny, but not purely there for laughs. Simple enough to buy, yet complex enough to have dark things going on beneath the surface.You'll see a lot of comparisons to other films like 'Midsommar' or 'The Village' or 'The Wicker Man' among many others. They're fair comparisons, yet it feels like it just took the best from all those movies and combined them into one movie. There are also a lot of references to other horror movie scattered throughout the movie.This is a smart horror film. A second of viewing of this will have you saying ""oh, that makes sense now"" a lot. I was a little worried about the path the film was going down at one point near the middle, however it corrected itself masterfully and the ultimate conclusion was brilliant.I can honestly say I never checked how long to go once during 'A Classic Horror Story'. This is the best horror film I have seen in a while. It is so refreshing when a film breathes fresh life into the genre. A very strong 9/10.",A Classic Horror Story
6,Stevieboy666,Not A Classic Horror Story,6,29 September 2021,"Five travellers carpool in a RV through Italy but crash and find themselves stranded next to a wooden cabin, in the middle of some woods, inside which are some strange paintings depicting pagan gods and gory sacrifices. This movie does reference a lot of horror movies, Evil Dead, Blair Witch Project, The Wicker Man, Snuff, Cabin in the Woods, Hostel/Vacancy torture porn, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and so on, and it makes no apology for that, which is good. More homage than rip off, nothing wrong with that. The characters are all quite engaging, the scenery is nice and the place in which they appear trapped is very creepy. Decent first half. But then the the first twist comes and it's downhill for the second half, which for me was a shame. It became a bit silly and ended disappointingly. I could say the same for Hereditary (2018). The movie delivers some good gore and folk horror, plus I like the fact that despite Italian being the main language there is plenty of English dialogue too. I am a big fan of the older Italian horror classics, this is far from being one but none the less it is great that Italians are still making horror movies and I look forward to watching more, won't be re-watching this one though.",A Classic Horror Story
7,henry8-3,A Classic Horror Story,4,11 August 2021,"A group of travellers in a camper van crash and wake up to find themselves deep in a vast forest.It has been well noted that this film pays tribute to and / or copies many modern horror films such as The Evil Dead, Midsommar and The Wicker Man to name just a few. It is all delivered well enough with the requisite amount of blood and guts being spilled plus the performances are perfectly fine. There is a twist about 20 minutes from the end that does change things significantly and will surprise you and it makes that last 20 minutes much more enjoyable than the first 75. Whether you will be content that the cleverness of this end section will compensate for the deep adequacy of the main body of the film is something to consider before setting off - on balance I'm not sure it was enough.",A Classic Horror Story
8,yusufpiskin,Cliche,4,15 July 2021,"Let's face it, the movie is a ball of clichés. But it does not promise otherwise. Italian cinema is very rich in horror films. As such, expectations are high. The movie doesn't upset the audience, but it doesn't make them happy either.",A Classic Horror Story
9,Pairic,Meta Horror,7,15 July 2021,"A Classic Horror Story: Southern Gothic but this film is set in the South of Italy and the Gothic shades into Folk Horror. There are elements of pastiche here as several tropes are mixed - a group of people who are car pooling get involved in a crash, when they come to they are in their camper van but it's in a forest clearing. Nearby is a deserted house, in it they find pictures of a Pagan cult who worship three knights who helped them in a time of famine. But there is also evidence of savage rituals, in a mini-Wicker Man they find a girl whose tongue has been cut out. Then the fun begins, hordes of cultists wearing bark masks and animal masks act out the ritual. Some very disturbing scenes as ears are cut off, eyes cut out and sacrifices made as a full size Wicker Man appears. There are influences here from the Wicker Man, Midsommar and a 1975 film Race With The Devil but ACHS has it's own strengths and puts it's own stamp on things. The film takes a strange turn and their are plot twists which sends the narrative off in an even more bizarre direction as we get into the territory of Meta-Horror. While this might not be a classic it's well worth watching. Co-Directed/Co-Written by Roberto De Feo and Paolo Strippoli. On Netflix. 7/10.",A Classic Horror Story
10,andrewchristianjr,CABIN IN THE WOODS + MIDSOMMAR.,7,8 August 2021,This film is like The Cabin in the Woods and Midsommar in the way it is self aware. The gore was pretty well done.

12,arungeorge13,Some redeemable factors in a predictably gory Italian horror flick! [+49%],5,25 July 2021,"As the name suggests, directors Roberto De Feo & Paolo Strippoli borrow familiar tropes from classic horror films - both old as well as recent (not gonna name any!) - and give it their own spin. Plotwise, there's nothing new on offer. Look up the one-line synopsis of horror films that begin with ""A group of people.."" and you'll know the gist. There's plenty of meta-referencing to horror classics and filmmakers, adding a quintessential satirical touch. While the kill count is pretty low, the kills themselves are pretty gruesome. The colour-grading and cinematography are also quite remarkable, giving the first hour of the film an eerie outlook.Coming to the characterizations and performances, there isn't much to gloat about. It's obvious that the makers are focusing more on atmosphere-building than characters, thereby inevitably acknowledging style over substance. As a satirical homage to horror classics, I'd say it delivers partially. The fairly obvious twist towards the end lands without fail to some extent, though I can't vouch for it elevating the film altogether. The mid-credits sequence is also pretty intriguing, without saying much. Maybe, it's a depiction of how the world of (Italian) horror has evolved over the years. I'd have liked to see some crazy cannibals too if that was the case!",A Classic Horror Story
13,gianmarcoronconi,Ugly,1,20 July 2021,"This movie is ugly in the true sense of the word and has nothing to save it. Boring, repetitive and with an ending as stupid as few. The acting is good but otherwise the film does not entertain, it is obvious and bored. Many central elements in the film seem to be randomly placed there with no real logical sense just to carry on the plot which is itself senseless.",A Classic Horror Story
14,gedikreverdi,A melange of horror films,6,13 September 2021,At first I thought why would someone make such a derivative horror film? And then I got a pretty satisfying answer. My only concern is that the characters except for the final girl were so unlikeable.They had an accident with an RV in southern Italy in the middle of nowhere and ended up in front of a ominous cabin and it went full wicker man and midsommar. Then it turned out the driver of the carpool was actually a deranged guy filming people getting killed for his own horror film and provide victims for some elite deranged people who likes watching people get killed I guess. The mafia is involved I guess at least it's implied at some point. Then the final girl shot the little girl who acted like a victim whose tongue was ripped off for the ritual and then she shot the man dead. Then she found a way out and it was a military zone (the village anyone?) and ended up in a crowded beach. All people did was film her with their phones.,A Classic Horror Story
15,Fernando-Rodrigues,"A Classic Terror Movie! (Ew, Netflix)",6,2 October 2021,"The main idea is interesting, but its execution has some flaws.

16,PsychoBeard666,A missed opportunity,7,14 July 2021,"5 strangers carpooling in an RV find themselves in a terrifying situation after driving into a tree.It's an Italian film but does have some English sprinkled in. I put subtitles on because I find English dubbing removes me from the film.I don't want to go into too much detail in regards to the plot because I fear I'll spoil it. I will say that it promises to be a brutal and claustrophobic bloodfest but doesn't follow through, instead trying to subvert expectations.Definitely watch it, but I doubt you'll watch it twice.",A Classic Horror Story
17,redrobin62-321-207311,Midsommar...Italian Style and Just As Bad,1,3 September 2021,"I ventured forthwith into ""A Classic Horror Story"" knowing only one thing - it's a horror movie. I didn't read about it, saw any previews or checked it's rating. In essence, a completely blind viewing. As it unfolds, you start sensing a touch of ""The Wicker Man."" As it unfolded, though, it sunk right into dreadful ""Midsommar"" territory - unoriginal plotting, ovedone sobbing, predictable outcomes, etc. Everything on display had been seen before, including the incredibly stupid mistakes the characters made. The good news? It clocked in at a relatively brisk 90 minutes. It was also a good cure for insomnia, so there's that.",A Classic Horror Story
18,Patient444,"""By your powers combined, I am all the horrors!""",3,15 July 2021,"Well, don't want to be mean about it, but Italian horror still has to learn. A lot. Even if you're a big Argento fan, you have to admit they are not quite there yet.So when I saw that the budget problem was fixed, this being a Netflix production, I actually had some high hopes for it. Considering how the reviews were really split in the middle, and that I am a huge horror fan, I have to admit I was expecting to genuinely have some good time with this one.Boy was I wrong, for A Classic Horror Story managed to mash up so many other movies before it, like Wrong Turn, Silent Hill, The Ritual, Midsommar, Cabin in the Woods and possibly others, being all over the place, without an identity for itself, just randomly copying everything it remembered. It's like The Thing let loose in a horror section, morphing into an abomination that simply put, does not make sense.All in all, I can not recommend this one, it was a difficult watch, boring and frustrating at times because it really was hard to keep up with everything that was happening.Cheers!",A Classic Horror Story
19,Movi3DO,Tried to be smart but didn't land it,6,16 July 2021,"A new Italian horror on Netflix.If u watched this movie and realized: hey we saw this same old plot a hundred times before, then you're right. And based on the title, the writer clearly knew this. This was also shown through the characters comparing their situation to typical horror movie tropes.As the movie progressed, the writers were trying to deliver seemingly witty and clever messages to audiences about how we view horror movies and how horror nasties were made. However, at the end, I felt lackluster because I saw this messages in other movies before. Also, from the execution of the movie, I felt that the script didn't fully understand its own message.The characters were pretty predictable as well. Our main girl is played by Matilda Anna Ingrid Lutz. Based on what her character went through and her appearance in previous movies, I was sure about the twist and what her character would do in the end pretty early on in the movie. Her badass scenes were short, so she didn't have much to do.Overall, an okay movie with some gore and atmosphere at the beginning, but it tried to be smart and didn't succeed. 6/10.",A Classic Horror Story
20,SameirAli,Patience till the end.,6,21 August 2021,"Well, this film is somewhat good but, not really up to the mark. A cocktail of Classic Horror films, but, it was somewhat justified to the end.

21,SoumikBanerjee25,Poor Man's Midsommar!,5,16 July 2021,"While being highly reminiscent of old-school Horror pieces, this Italian production has also drawn striking inspirations from numerous Modern-Era titles (Midsommar, The Ritual, Unfriended to name a few). With imperative cognizance for atmospheric world-building, ""A Classic Horror Story"", has passed the test of look & appearance with flying colors. However, when it comes to the rest; things aren't level.Allow me to begin on a positive note. First off, Its technical expertise is entitled to some plaudits of its own. The Director duo, Roberto De Feo & Paolo Strippoli made the most of all the stringent resources they could forgather. And that is blatantly obvious in the finished product too.Such a well-versed application of Blood & Gore will be cherished by many and I am quite certain that this would be a hot topic to have further discussions on. Aside from its discernible prowess in the department of Cinematography; I must say, the color grading conveyed an indelible impression. Blue and Red; two domineering colors, interchangeably augmented greater influence on individual shots.Now, coming down to Performances; unfortunately, there's not much to talk about. Despite the actors (especially, Matilda Anna Ingrid Lutz & Francesco Russo) doing a decent enough work, their honest efforts were unavailing simply due to the fact that their characters had insufficient depth or any sort of establishment whatsoever!The fundamental issues inhabit deep down its narrative layout. As it dealt with the likes of Satanism, Cults, Sacrifices; pretty much all run-of-the-mill tropes, the storytelling was in dire need of productive alterations. They gave it a shot by having a Cross-Genre attempt at it, but still and all I have gnawing doubts over its efficacy for the longer term.",A Classic Horror Story

24,danielcereto,Midsomar meets The Cabin in the woods,6,16 July 2021,"Looks like the director was inspired by movies like Midsomar, The Purge, The Cabin in the wood and Hostel. Unluckily the mixture it's not as good as it could have been.First, the storyline is quite interesting with it's ups and downs. What it does not deliver fully is the message from the last part of the movie. Good idea but not quite convincing. A shame.Second, there are so many questions to answer after the credits pop up. Looks like the script get stuck in the middle of nowhere, like the development of all characters. We only know a bit from all of them at the end of the movie. Impossible to root for someone.So, overall a good effort and watchable but far from movies like The Cabin in the woods. A real classic horror story that one.",A Classic Horror Story

And still, once all is said and done - and the end credits roll- it managed to create something unique and different. Something not at all related to the earlier mentioned classics. I agree, the 1st 40 min or so scream copycat and tax your patience only to set the stage (spoiler) of what to come.

29,President_George_Washington,FROM THE DESK OF GEORGE WASHINGTON,6,25 August 2021,"Good Morrow, countrymen.Michael Haneke asked in his seminal ""Funny Games"" just how much human misery a viewer can stomach before they turn away. The answer, endless. Since then, countless films have cropped up with varying themes of anonymous person(s) watching (usually through Social Media), betting and enjoying the pain of others. In Funny Games, we, the viewer were the voyeurs and just as guilty of blood lust as those who secretly pay for the thrill.From Hostile to 13: Game of Death, Hunger, and more. The list is huge and the idea is now a solid trope. Abduct a bunch of people, place them captivity or an impossible situation and watch them perform various tasks while the unseen watch on computers from locations around the globe. In essence, they're all just dressed-up Snuff Films and we're watching others watching people getting tortured.That's where ACHS gets its inspiration. Much has been said about the various homages to other films; Midsommer, The Wicker Man, Blair Witch, The Ritual, and even Race with the Devil (a fav of mine), it's all in this to varying degrees. On the surface it looks great, but once the twist is revealed, the questions a logical person will ask collapse the entire premise.As a viewer, you're asked to accept that dozens (hundreds) of people are involved massive serial killing enterprise that is being shown as a live-action horror film over the ""dark net.""
What should have been a straight forward satanic cult flick that happily paid homage to some older classics is squandered to - once again - make the case that we're essentially sickos who like watching human suffering via a gory horror flick.They did include a Final Girl who eventually channels her inner I Spit on your Grave, but by that time, it's too late...it ends on a big dumb cliché...everybody with their phones out filming human suffering instead of helping.Mr. Haneke would be proud.Fare thee well, it's hoecakes and Madeira time.",A Classic Horror Story

32,dasa108,Good music and production design. However the film does not catch.,4,14 August 2021,"This film has a beginning that pays homage to found fottage films. Then we go to the section of lost in a forest with a cabin that seems to arouse suspicion. More Blair Witch is impossible. Then we go to the diabolical cult section and of these there are thousands. Finally come the surprises: snuff movies with an unexpected twist. Keeping all the possible clichés, we have our final girl who goes through very complicated adventures and then takes revenge without any difficulty. This is like I spit on your grave. The characters don't catch and the only good thing about the movie is the final half hour. Music stands out and certain songs that awaken a lot of charm. That's the good thing about Italy: the food and the music. The ending is open and disappointing. I give it a four simply for the music and some successful sequences. It's rare for a technically good movie to be so disappointing; This normally happens because the spectator's identification with some character or with the situation that is lived is not achieved.

But even the satire element is nothing new, on no level at all does this offer anything different, actually the fact that it's so like such a vast amount of different films maybe does make it different..it's twist was probably the biggest cliche, and way too obvious, almost ruined it for me, once you figure it out in the first few minutes it's like the movie spends the next hour making it ridiculously obvious over and over again and then wants you to be surprised when it's revealed.But it's fine, worth a watch if thats what your into.",A Classic Horror Story

You'll see many of the same people who give nothing but low scores and give the same reason for why the movie is bad. If for no other reason the insight in to an Italian folk legend that is completely unknown to us should immediately get respect on its own but this is a great story with excellent pace fantastic visuals with talented people putting on an excellent show top to bottom. It's scary without jump scares it's tense and with an unexpected and well thought out story arc's that's more than one story arc.

Well I was right for one thing.Just try it and you'll most probably enjoy it. The start is really good, I like the cinematography and it doesn't look ""cheaply made"" or something. Most of the death scenes are really horrifying. The twist is almost good and to be honest it's quite surprising, but in my opinion it wasn't executed very well. The ending is super weird.I have a some questions still. Who is the mayor and all those weird people? Are they actors too or something? This movie is so weird and I like it. I gotta Google for answers.I can compare this film to Cabin in the Woods, except the viewers are like real people and not some evil God or whatever.

It is one of the most creative and innovative horror films I've ever seen! And it even makes a point at the end about how people superficially judge films these days without even watching them, so its ironic that some people are probably doing that with this film. Or maybe some people are just so stupid that they didn't really understand it, which is sad.

Costume design cannot be called great. But there's a good plot-related reason for all this, so wait till your reach the last few portions of the movie before you decide anything.What the movie seemed to lack in uniqueness (script, costume, props, theme) it made up for in technique (direction, cinematography) and culture (music, Italian folk horror).""A Classic Horror Story"" on Netflix is filled with well-paced chills and little to no irrelevant jump-scares. It immerses you in the story and its characters, a decision that some horror-genre titles don't apply to their scripts; to their detriment.The movie may flow slowly for some, but that's where the 'sorcery' resides. By letting us get familiar with the people, i.e., the characters, we feel for their humanity when the story twists, and turns dark, and then darker still.English is sporadically spoken - especially by two of the characters. The movie is best enjoyed with subtitles, of course.I must draw your attention to the musical score (ambiance, sound effects) used throughout this movie. They're 'different' in a good way.There was a special strain of mystery and experimentation in this film. I have only ever seen that in the indie-horror circuit. As mentioned earlier, an Italian folk-horror flavour pervades this story, which probably helped highlight its uniqueness in the genre.Both Roberto De Feo and Paolo Strippoli did great work on Direction. Along with Lucio Besana, they crafted engaging dialogues and delivered memorable characterization.The cast gave convincing performances. The 'pagan ritual' scenes were exceptionally detailed, and performed. The blood and gore makeup was credible.""A Classic Horror Story"" Netflix is definitely worth a watch. While it does not focus on anything strictly supernatural or paranormal in nature, the movie contains all the creeps and chills needed to provide a good horror viewing experience.It also packs meaningful and interesting twists, hints, and foreshadowing elements.

There were so many little things only someone who speaks Italian and/or lives in Italy would actually understand.I laughed, I was horrified. I didn't have to see any stupid sex scenes. What more can one ask for?I don't usually watch Italian TV or films because seriously, the majority of them are stupid in my opinion, at least the ones I have been exposed to, so I will opt out, but this time, after seeing the trailer, I had to.Francesco Russo is incredible. He stole the show. I hope to see more of him.The film gives some Midsommer vibes, then just as easily some Chainsaw Massacre and then VHS. It's got twists and turns that the viewer can't imagine, and that ending with the guy rating it after only reading others' opinions and seeing literally 5 seconds of the movie? That was PRICELESS.This movie was slash and gore and fear and terror and horror AND a social commentary and I hope to gawd there will more like it.Ho dato solo 9 perche' ci sono dei spoofs.

So those who keep saying that this movie isn't classic are correct. But not for the right reason.I'll be honest, it had me going until they had that weird meal which was straight outta Midsommar. Then that rando lady blathering on and just up and leaving. That's when it got stupid.I was expecting more. Too rushed. The doctor tells everyone about his story, and he even has that lil' family thing...only to be killed off like that.

After that, the script becomes a bit tedious dealing with excessive drama elements that just take from the thick horror atmosphere that the directors established in the first half.

75,sorendanni,Great Italian take on The Cabin In The Woods,9,28 July 2021,"What a fun addition to Netflix! It is a surprising film that I can certainly recommend.Initially, the film seems to be a cross between a remake of Wrong Turn and Wicker Man. A group of tourists who carpool get off the road. There is a strange wooden hut, they seem to be victims of locals who want to sacrifice them in a Black Mass, a ritual in honor of Demons. But then the plot twist: actually they are the victims of one of their travel companions. A failed film director makes big money selling Snuff Movies, packaged as suspenseful Horror films, to the Southern Italian Mafia. Unknowing, the other traveling companions are therefore the characters in the most bizare Snuff imaginable.A movie within a movie! Obviously, 2011's Cabin In The Woods was the inspiration here. But what a great reinterpretation this have become. This film is super exciting, beautifully filmed and provided with very realistic acting. The film can easily compete with recent American Horror films, without having to give up its authentic Italian character.Also nice is the self-mockery: For those who don't know, Italy has a rich tradition in Thriller and Horror films. Although Italian Horror has had a major influence on American Horror from the 1970s onwards (the glorious Italian Giallo era was the blueprint for the American Slasher movies), Italian Horror is seen as something marginal in the mainstream.

Well, this one tried but it ended up not really striking a cord with me. It started out serious, and with all outward appearances seemed to be a fairly decent horror movie. A group of five people are heading towards their destination but things go bad and they end up in a scary place. It has the feel of a satanic cult movie. A fairly typical set-up for the genre. But the characters are nothing to root for or care about. Right away you want three of them to die and when they do, it still feels unsatisfying. Now you have the two main characters left alive, a guy and a girl, and the guy turns out be the evil villain who was in on it all along. But there's a major twist that nobody could see coming because it's totally ridiculous. The guy is the director of this ""real life"" horror movie. He is the actual director and they've been filming it all along. It's silly and absurd at this point. Then the film turns into some social commentary on society and what people really want to see and it just feels like a let down. The film also makes fun of itself which just seems even more out of place to me considering it spent over an hour trying to convince me it was a horror movie. I appreciate the effort of trying to be different and giving the viewer something new to watch. That's why I gave it six stars.

It may be hard for some to believe today, but once upon a time Italian horror was bold, innovative and fresh. Italia invented many of the clichès we find today.A classic horror story is at its heart a love story to horror fans everywhere, inviting them back to Italian horror. This is a serious attempt at reviving an industry on a global scale. A showreel of where Italy has already been even though you only remember the more recent cliches. And a conversation about the insatiable desire of humanity for the very thing that once made Italian horror so beloved, bold carnage.The perhaps sad truth is however, all the attempts to speak at a younger audiences level fell flat, delivering what turns out to be something rather dull. Will it serve its purpose and drive cult followers back into Italian cinema? Perhaps, only time will tell. But I wouldn't hold my breath.

The implication seemed to be that he's just doing yeoman work due to the demand.

The car crashed at the road and the next morning, they found themselves in front of an abandoned house in the middle of a forest.The movie took many references from Cabin in the Woods, Midsommar, The Ritual. So the storyline was pretty predictable. Cinematography and the use of colour palette are really good. The focus on character development is minimal in this film. There's a fine blend of folk horror.

Don't believe low ratings.,10,23 August 2021,"This is horror meta satire at its finest since the likes of Scream, Cabin in the Woods, and Funny Games. If you like those, you'll enjoy this. Like the aforementioned, this isn't comedy, but has moments that are like a metaphorical wink and a nod to the horror fan viewers.I think people who were upset by this must have some upset that the commentary throughout the entire movie went over their heads somehow. I certainly didn't see the twist coming - and I loved it - but the movie had clear meta references throughout the entirety, literally having characters offhandedly mention other horror movies. And that occurs multiple times. That isn't to say it isn't scary. It definitely gets serious pretty quickly and does serve some true horror.There are some absolute unnerving scenes which will make you wince. Dread. Fear of the unknown. Many horror elements, but if you want jumpscares and constant gore, pass on this one. It's a deeper horror, and its dialogue is fairly important.Also imo, watch this in its original Italian. I started watching it in English and disliked the dubbing a fair bit, and swapped to Italian. I was surprised when 50-75% of the dialogue for the first third of the movie was in English. Later on, it's Italian only, but still. The fact the dialogue is in multiple languages adds something to the beginning and is a factor in some scenes. But the dub is probably fine.The ending leaves some things not completely outlined and spoon-fed, but I see the merits in why it didn't. The movie delivers the message it intends fully.I put this on expecting some light horror fare, knowing it was said to be a bit of a clever satire, but did not expect to absolutely love it. This film does not deserve so low of a score, and I don't understand the negative reviews at all.",A Classic Horror Story
95,med-01081,Mix and mash of multiple movies in one,7,16 July 2021,"A mixup of the ritual, the wicker man, midsommar and the truman show! Pretty good little unexpected netflix horror film with a bit of a different take. There is a few plot holes and a lot doesnt make sense but i liked the direction it went in. There are some decent shots here and there but it could have had a bit more style considering it was made by the Italians who used to make excellent horror films. The acting is ok some are over the top and others are corny however they all serve the purpose of the characters they are playing. Its not a traditional horror film but it is definitely worth watching if you are a horror fan who likes it when things are a bit different from the current blockbuster horrors that have not been very good as of late. This at least had a bit of originality to it although it borrowed from many films it still had potential and is worth a watch.",A Classic Horror Story

I think they're really kind of weird. This movie started off good but ended up being really dumb. And the violence is over the top like up there was something like Hostel. I don't mind violence and gore if it's part of the story and not just gratuitous there's no real purpose for it. The only thing that left me really intrigued and occupied was when they were in the attic and their friends was being killed below them. I couldn't help but think why aren't they helping. I mean there's only a few of them down there And there's a ton of them in the attic. I don't know how you could sit and watch something happen like that to somebody and not do anything.

110,tiefirst,"Ok, but should have gone a different way",6,15 September 2021,"This movie had the chance and looked to be taking it, to be a great modern day horror movie. I have watched so much horror that I am officially desensitized. There isn't a horror movie past or prrsent that does much to bring fear to me. This isn't a brag, it just means I've watched too much of the subject matter. With that said, A Classic Horror Story had a good chance to put a little chill down my spine. This movie was doing all of the right things.....up until its little plot twist when it tried to go Cabin in the Woods on the audience. The set up of the protagonists being lost in a remote setting that they kept circling back to was a good start. Then they add some cultist figures that came complete with their own folklore. All is still good. Add in some well built suspence, a splash of dread, some mood lighting, and I'll even give a little credit to the spooky sirens. This was all working up to this point. If the movie would have ran with that, it had some potential. Nope. It had to be cute or clever and switch things up. It was more important for the creators to have a gotcha moment than just proceed with what was working. That plot twist ruined the movie. It completely took all of the wind out of the sails that was a perfectly respectable horror film.I gave this movie a 6 for all of the good it was doing to get things going.

For the majority of A Classic Horror Story's runtime, it is pretty standard horror fare with a lot of reliance on cliches and winks towards the meta, and for that this is really the epitome of a 5/10 film... but I can't deny that the final act of the movie entertained me a great deal, either, so for that I'll bump my score up to a 6.",A Classic Horror Story

I'm sorry to break it to you, but that's not intelligent. That's lazy.Whatever A Classic Horror Story tried to do, was already done (with much more finesse) by The Cabin in the Woods (by director Drew Goddard). Not even in cinematography, audio mixing, editing or photography there was any noteworthy accomplishment. I guess the acting was good, but it's what you half expect from a horror movie: people screaming, shouting and crying.

138,davidcbabsthurgarland,Guys..it's straight up satire!,7,20 July 2021,"So I'm confused and concerned by many of the reviews on here. There are several reviews, short and to the point, that criticize this film because it's a 'rip off' of ""The Ritual"", ""Midsommar"", ""Cabin in the Woods"", ""Blair Witch"" and so on and so forth. Are people literal idiots? There is dialogue in this movie that directly addresses the fact that this is a satirical commentary on the horror genre and the public's fascination with brutal crime. I believe the film even references the Amanda Knox case at one point. So I can only assume that the people writing these reviews either don't pay attention, don't understand nuance, are stupid...or all of the above.If U don't like the film based on its subject matter, the direction is sub par, the production is lacking or the acting lackluster - sure, critique the film accordingly. Same goes if U enjoy any of the aforementioned things - review it accordingly. But don't call something a rip off cause you're too daft to read between the lines (or simply pay attention to the dialogue).I thought the movie was solid: Directing, script, set pieces and acting were all super impressive.

Original ? No not at all. Ripoff ? Well the title and the movie characters even said that.But the atmosphere is great, the soundtrack is creepy, the acting was good, the dark humour well placed and the most important thing is it will keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole time.I guess the lesson i learned about myself today is that if you can keep my adrenaline rushing, i wont pay much attention to how original your story really is, and for a hidden horror gem on netflix thats more than i can expect.",A Classic Horror Story

159,danieleliasson93,A lazy mash up/ ripoff,1,3 August 2021,"Here are a few reasons why A Classic Horror Story doesn't hold up:1. The storyline.It gets your attention in the beginning, sure, but when the main storyline unfolds it just falls flat. It´s like the writers deliberately wants to trick you that the movie actually holds a unique storyline when its really just an unclear mash up. Pick a lane? As a cherry on top of the lazy writing, the protagonist and antagonist actually adresses the ripoff aspect in their dialogue - guess that solves the problem of not having any original content to add?2. The lack of build-ups.There really isn´t any tension. Just a few jump scares.3. The music.Ok, we get it. That wood-hitting noice every third second is kinda creepy. But it gets used throughout the whole movie and therefore isn't subtle any longer.4. Playing the victim META-style/""They can´t hurt us if we hurt ourselves first"".In the Post-credit scene we see a man watching A Classic Horror Story on ""Bloodflix"". He immediately skips forward, watches for a total of 10 seconds, and shuts it of. Then he reviews the movie with a ""thumbs down"".

161,grg_sledgedrumer,Another slasher with irrational characters' decisions,4,19 July 2021,"I have to acknowledge that the photography is great in that movie but just that. All else was kinda a disaster. But lets take things from the beggining.The director does constantly ""creepy"" things to keep the intherest high but many times this feels forced and unexplainable.Is it a torture movie a splatter or what?! The torturer decide to break each of the first victims ankles only to kill him seconds later ?! And why the actor doesnt scream from pain like it is his last breath when they pierce his eyes?! I wear contact lenses and when something goes wrong it gives me immense amounts of pain. And i dont have to mention that he already sufferes the pain from his ankles.Later on, they find some abandoned cars probably belonging to some earlier victims. And they do what?! They fight each other, and the protagonist enters one car with the rescued girl having a needless cheesy moment like all is calm and nice. Well guess what?! It isnt. They are being chased by some lunatics. This scene feels so much out of place. They act like they have all the time in the world.And the the doctor takes a small pipe and acts like he is cutting some vines with a machette in a jungle!!!Moving on, we see cliche scenes like the one that they wonder in the woods the day after the first one was killed. And they end up back in the cabin. When u want to go as far as possible from something u just walk a straight line away from that something. Noone realised thay they were going in a circle?! And no one suspected Fabricio?! Totally weird and convenient for the poor plot.And when they are taking the eyes out of the tied up victims when arent they screaming like there is no tomorrow!And whats all that unexplained and unexplainable weirdness with the sounds the villagers make during their torture?!And how there were a nice little beach so close to all that havoc?!It was just another one movie with scenes just to shock and nothing else.

The first hour featured plenty of classic tropes (group of strangers, car crash, waking up in an unknown location, creepy cult people) but it acknowledges this ""predictable"" set up in a way that seemed fresh and promising. Don't let that fool you.The last 40 minutes of this film descend into moronic complexity - it reeks of a film trying to be smarter than it is. If you feel like you've seen this before, it's because you probably have. Midsommar, The Ritual, The Cabin In The Woods - it's all here. But it's all done so poorly, jumping from ""plot twist"" to plot twist so quickly and with no real explanation that it just makes no sense. To top it off, the final scenes are like a live action remake of those cartoons you see middle age relatives sharing on Facebook, lamenting the younger generations dependency on smart phones.

Also, it seemed like Netflix was using ""reverse psychology"" to get a higher rating, like the last scene where everyone was bashing the film and the ""male viewer"" gave it a thumbs down, as if to say ""don't be like them"". Well, I may be reading too much into it, but not falling for that BS! Ha Or maybe I and the hundreds of others are doing exactly what the film intended to prove by complaining about it!

It was suspenseful, I'll give it that. But some of the elements were just too predictable, like the video guy being behind everything. He was suspicious from the time they crashed their van, and it just became more and more obvious as the plot unfolded. The little girl being part of it was also not surprising in the slightest.

Instead, it attempts to make the viewer think about how we perceive violence and fails miserably.Are we as a human race interested or even entertained by violence? Sure, but A Classic Horror Story goes a step too far and creates a world in which we are all so obsessed with violence that we can't be bothered to help an injured woman as she tries to drown herself. No, all we can do is watch and record with our phones.Where A Classic Horror Story fails is not in its identification of a dark human trait but rather in its inability to see people as anything beyond that trait. Each character is either a bloodthirsty maniac or snuff fodder. There are no real personalities, no balance to the darker side of humanity as there is in the real world.The film feels pretentious, like the writers are convinced that they know this dark truth about humanity that the rest of us haven't thought about or ignore.

It's not perfect, but it deserves at least 6-7 out it 10.I'd like to see more of these directors, I hope Netflix will give them the opportunity to make more projects like this.",A Classic Horror Story
233,daniellecruz-34422,It was a pretty decent horror film...,8,14 August 2021,"...I really don't know what all the hate is. But it was thrilling and fun. It's the kind of ""horror"" film that will make you think about the WHYs and the HOWs then you get to the ending and it blows your heads off. Pun intended.",A Classic Horror Story
234,chicogeno,Surprisingly good,7,16 July 2021,"I didn't have great expectations, but I ended up enjoying it. A bit of meta-cinema that might seem forced at times, but overall good and entertaining; better than 95% of horrors on Netflix.",A Classic Horror Story
235,osciepreece,Good fun but felt rushed,7,14 July 2021,"Just finished watching and really enjoyed myself. As fun as it is, it is rather short and the movie let's itself down at the very end. It felt like they couldn't be bothered to explain the bigger picture and decided to call it quits. There were lots of twists and turns that felt like they were there for shock value, then they would just move the story along without explaining anything.Overall great acting and the cinematography and directing is outstanding. I recommend for fans of Midsommar if your a fan of more artsy/shock factor movies rather than an in-depth story.Anyway, this is just my take
Good fun. Solid movie 7/10
BTW The main actress is stunning.",A Classic Horror Story
236,thomsen_joshua,Nothing special,2,25 July 2021,People say it is satire and because the film is conscious about being a boring mix of Horrorfilms doesn't make itself any better.,A Classic Horror Story
237,egidiosilva,Music,10,18 July 2021,"The song that plays at the time of the first murder is actually a classic of Brazilian children's music, the original name is ""A Casa"" by Vinícius de Moraes and Toquinho and very well known in Brazil.",A Classic Horror Story
238,rdka,Better than most netflix horror films,8,20 July 2021,"I think there are two types of person, the one that says, that wasn't what I expected it sucked, and the one that says, I wasn't expecting this, that's cool, and I think that is the main difference between the low and the high ratings in this movie.I personally like it, it is different, and I'm not saying that makes it good, but really is a well planed flim, the people who says that it is a satire and don't like, probably didn't give it a thought, or maybe didn't even finish it.",A Classic Horror Story
