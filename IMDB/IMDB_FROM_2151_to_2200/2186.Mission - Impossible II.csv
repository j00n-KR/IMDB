0,TheLittleSongbird,"The film does have a lot of problems, but I didn't think it was awful",7,23 May 2010,"Despite the convoluted plot, I thoroughly enjoyed the first Mission:Impossible, because it was brisk, it was well made and it was slick. Watching the sequels, I know the second is considered the worst of the series, but while I enjoyed the third film too personally I thought that was the weakest. Mission:Impossible 2 does have a lot of problems, but I didn't find it awful. The plot is less convoluted here, which I appreciated, but what was missing was the brisk efficiency of the first film. The pacing consequently in the first half is very pedestrian and it is only at the half-way mark when it picks up. Also the dialogue is very uneven, sometimes it sparkles sometimes it fizzles. My third and final flaw is Dougray Scott, I have nothing personal against him but his performance as the thief I found very by-the-numbers here. On the plus side, the direction is innovative, the sets, lighting and cinematography are superb, the stunts and special effects are mind-blowing and the music was delightful. And the acting was above decent, with Tom Cruise good in his role, but he is overshadowed by a very fetching Thandie Newton, the ever wonderful Anthony Hopkins and a charismatic Ving Rhames. Overall, decent sequel but the first is better. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Mission - Impossible II
1,Leofwine_draca,Not one of John Woo's better films,5,29 August 2016,"Another summer blockbuster and a fine example of Tom Cruise's fat, bloated ego, exemplified by the various shots designed to show off how ""cool"" and ""sexy"" Cruise really is. Thankfully ditching the head-scratching plot of the first film, Woo and Cruise strive to create a James Bond-type feel to this action adventure, and ably succeed. While it's a lot easier to follow than Brian de Palma's 1996 hit, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II is frustratingly difficult to like, and happy to trot out cliché after uninspired cliché as its plot.Action/Woo fans are also bound to be disappointed by the sheer lack of gunfights/battles/chases in this film as well. From the sheer spectacle of the dangerous cliff-hanging opening to the sickly sweet, sentimental ending, this film mostly fails to deliver the goods. The token car chase is done as gasp comedy, while the standard gun battle is over far too quickly and is also far less violent than in Woo's previous films - for a start, most of the deaths are off screen! The film only really comes into it's own with a stylish motorbike chase: it's fast, furious (and, as par for the course, totally outlandish), and also extremely thrilling, with plenty of explosions and stunts to keep the rubber burning and the octane pumping.Aside from this spectacular finish, the first hour of this film is stultifyingly boring, and mostly consists of static conversations. Far too much reliance is placed on loud music for effect, and the acting is nothing to write home about. Cruise is fairly wooden and too good looking for the hero, while Thandie Newton starts off well and goes downhill quickly. Dougray Scott makes the best of his bad guy, but can't disguise the ill fortune of his miscasting, while Anthony Hopkins sleepwalks a pointless cameo. Ving Rhames is also wasted, once again, in a supporting role. Why not give this guy a break and cast him as the lead for a change! The clichés come quick and fast in this film, and you'll lose count of the number of times we see characters remove their rubber faces to reveal somebody else hidden underneath. And, while I'm at it, Woo, have you ever heard of subtlety? By the time I saw those bloody doves flying about in slow motion AGAIN I was ready to tear my hair out. No doubt that this film was designed to be shown at the cinema; as it's full of loud action and music, watching it at home on video will surely lose a lot of the effect. Aside from the motorbike chase (which is top notch) this adventure is strictly par for the course.",Mission - Impossible II
2,SnoopyStyle,Lost the excitement of the first one,5,5 June 2014,"A scientist at Biocyte Pharmaceuticals has created a dangerous genetically modified disease called Chimera. A person infected for 20 hours with Chimera cannot be saved, not even with the cure Bellerophon. IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is tasked with bringing back the disease and cure but he's not the only one after it. Agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) posed as Ethan and managed to steal it from the scientist. Ethan has to recruit his ex Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) who is a civilian and a thief. It turns out that Nyah and Sean had a relationship and Sean wants her back. Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) is back as the third member of the team.It opens with a great shot of Tom Cruise climbing a rock face. Then it pretty much slowly goes downhill from there. Tom Cruise and Thandie Newton have reasonable chemistry. The problem is that director John Woo takes a long time to get going. It spends so much unnecessary time with the couple and then explaining the story. There is the usual John Woo action touches. It's just way too slow. Thandie has so little energy in her performance and John Woo doesn't have enough big meaningful action scenes. There is still some good action going on especially that bike chase. The first movie was wildly exciting even if it was confusing. This one just lost all the energy of the first one. Also Australia doesn't really count as exotic. It is just generally a step back.",Mission - Impossible II
3,kosmasp,Make up your own mind,7,4 April 2007,"I know that most people don't like this installment in the MI franchise. Either they are (John) Woo Fans and say he was pushed around by Tom Cruise (which he might have been, I wasn't there so I don't know). Mission Impossible fans (most from part 1) who say there is not enough story here.Let me straighten it out, the way I see it. Yes it is not the best John Woo movie ever. His trademarks are still there (maybe even (en)forced by Tom Cruise, who is also a producer here, besides the fact that he has the lead role). Yes there is not much plot/story ... you could even say none at all. Still I found it better than making one up (such as the BS from part 1). And it makes the whole film more ""believable"". More believable in the sense that you know, you are in a ""world"" that isn't real! So scenes like the motorcycle duel can happen won't bother you or take you out of the movie.Yes there are things, that still are bothering even me (7 out of 10 isn't a perfect grade). For once the scene, where Thandie Newton and Tom are in their cars and are spinning around in slow motion. There are people who really hate this scene. I'm just gonna say that it is to long! Main themes that Woo used in his HK-days are missing too.It is something you should expect when watching this. I liked it, but then again, that's me ... normally when you read this with the spoiler warning, it means you've made up your mind. I'm not here to change that ... I'm just stating my opinion! :o)",Mission - Impossible II
4,jboothmillard,Mission Impossible II,5,10 May 2006,"Four years since the first film, director John Woo (Broken Arrow, Face/Off) brings us the sequel to the hit action spy thriller based on the popular TV series. Basically Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is assigned to find and destroy a genetically created disease/virus called 'Chimera' and what is impossible is that he is not the only one wanting it. With the cure 'Bellerophon' being stolen by former IMF (Impossible Missions Force) turned villain Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), who plans infect the whole world, Hunt finds and falls for thief Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton), he needs her to find the terrorists' location. Also starring Sir Anthony Hopkins as Mission Commander Swanbeck, Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell, Moulin Rouge's Richard Roxburgh as Hugh Stamp, John Polson as Billy Baird, Brendan Gleeson as John C. McCloy, Mighty Joe Young's Rade Serbedzija as Dr. Nekhorvich, Lost's William Mapother as Wallis and Prison Break's Dominic Purcell as Ulrich. I think the only problem with this sequel is that you don't get the feeling that anything that needs done is impossible to do, apart from maybe one scene, and it doesn't just start slowly, it almost all is, apart from a few good chases and at least one good explosion. Tom Cruise was number 32 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 25 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Worth watching!",Mission - Impossible II
5,ccthemovieman-1,"60 Percent Good, But Last 40 Ruined It",6,29 October 2006,"The first 60 percent of this movie was pretty good; the last 40 percent was mostly action and mostly so hokey, so stupid, it was an insult for any viewer with a brain. Too bad, the first Mission Impossible was excellent and I hear the third film was good. However, this second one was a stinker by comparison.I except most films to have that ""Rambo mentality,"" as I call it, where hundreds of bullets are fired - and missed- at the hero, while he or she hits everything in sight. That was here but so overly done that is was absurd and downright annoying after awhile.Tom Cruise, our hero, should have been shot so many times I lost count. This is director John Woo, for you, who always overdoes action and sometimes makes it ridiculous.The good points are slick photography, interesting characters, good surround sound, low profanity and a very good soundtrack. Thandie Newton is attractive heroine and Dougray Scott is satisfactory as the main villain.The movie plays more like a James Bond film, although it still has MI touches such as the fake rubber masks we saw in the first film. More realism in that 40 minutes would have made this a far better film than it turned out to be. Oveall, a bit disappointing.",Mission - Impossible II
6,Tweekums,Quite different to the first film,9,10 July 2009,"Fans of the original Mission Impossible film may be a disappointed in this as there is a dramatic change in style which goes along with switching director from Brian De Palma to Hong Kong action supremo John Woo. Personally I loved this film and found it to be the most enjoyable of the three Mission Impossible films.Here the plot is far less convoluted, we know from the start who the bad guy is and we know what he is trying to do we just have to sit back and watch the action as our hero sets out to stop him. Sean Ambrose is a former member of the Mission Impossible team who has destroyed a plane carrying a scientist who had requested help from the Mission Impossible team, in order to find out why Ethan Hunt must recruit Nyah, Ambrose's beautiful former girl friend, and persuade her to go undercover to discover exactly what he is up to. It turns out that Ambrose is planning to hold a company to ransom using an artificial deadly disease to which he has stolen the cure to. Not that the company were that honourable, they had created the disease in order to create a demand for the cure.The action is impressive from start to finish, as one would expect from a John Woo film it is all perfectly choreographed, sure it isn't exactly believable but it is a lot of fun. Cruise is on form as our hero Ethan Hunt and Dougray Scott was suitably menacing as the villainous Ambrose, I also enjoyed Thandie Newton's performance as Nyah. If you are a fan of action films that don't require too much thought then I strongly recommend this one.",Mission - Impossible II

8,BA_Harrison,Mission: Impossible Woo.,6,30 March 2017,"Despite having a more than competent director in Brian De Palma, the first Mission: Impossible movie was a tad disappointing, it's convoluted plot and lack of action leaving this viewer struggling to remain focused. For the follow up, Hong Kong action expert John Woo took the reins, promising to pump some much needed adrenaline into Ethan Hunt's next adventure. But while many of the expected Wooisms are present and correct, the director's trademark high-octane thrills really only kick in in the final act, meaning that much of the film is just as tedious as DePalma's original, albeit thankfully a lot easier to follow.Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt, spy extraordinaire, whose mission is to convince sexy thief Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) to resume her relationship with international criminal Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), who has recently acquired the antidote to a deadly virus, and who is now trying to get his hands on the virus itself, hoping to sell the combo to the highest bidder. Helping Hunt on his mission are IMF agents Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Billy Baird (John Polson), the latter acting as comic relief.All of this is fairly humdrum—the old 'Earth threatened by a deadly virus' plot holds very few surprises—and much of it is silly (I lost count how many times the rubber mask trick came into play), but the film finally delivers the good stuff in the final reel, when Hunt gets to shoot at lots of bad guys, go wheel to wheel with Ambrose in an exhilarating motorcycle battle, and then duke it out with the boo-hiss villain on the beach. It is only then that Woo gets to really show what he is capable of, although the action is a little light on the blood squibs for my liking.6/10. Marginally more enjoyable than the first film, but still not great.",Mission - Impossible II
9,Quinoa1984,"Better than the first, really",6,3 June 2000,"John Woo's MI2 is a great example of what one can do with a not to great 1st film and turn it into a terrific sequel.  Tom Cruise is better than last time with a new edge (especially in those fight and chase scenes).  Woo, being the virtuoso director of this genre, brings this film to a fever pitch that is to be expected from his films.  With a great soundtrack, this film may not be exactly the best memorial day film made, but it is worth a look-see.  Anthony Hopkins appears unbilled as Cruise's boss. A",Mission - Impossible II
10,michaelRokeefe,Not worthy of all the hype.,6,17 June 2000,"Here we go again thinking and hoping the movie will be as good as the trailers. Not a total let down, but pretty much disappointing. Opening scenery is a spectacle. The plot of saving the world from a manufactured virus is stale. I personally thought the leading lady was not right for the part. The final thirty minutes or so made the whole thing worth sitting through. The motorcycle stunts and major fighting scene were great. For Tom Cruise fans all of this stuff surrounding him is oblivious anyway.Besides Cruise, also appearing are Ving Rhames, Dougray Scott and Thandie Newton.",Mission - Impossible II
11,sunwarrior13,A Secret Agent's Impossible Mission To Australia,1,8 October 2011,"Tom Cruise reprises his role as Ethan Hunt,a secret agent of the IMF,whose new impossible mission sends him this time to Australia. This is the second installment of the new Mission Impossible series.This time it is directed by John Woo and it also stars Dougray Scott,Thandie Newton,Rade Serbedzija and an uncredited Anthony Hopkins.In this new Mission Impossible movie,Ethan Hunt has been sent on a mission to retrieve and destroy the supply of Chimera,a genetically disease that was created to inflict disease to people around the world. One obstacle to his mission is that international terrorists headed by a former agent,Ambrose,portrayed excellently by Dougray Scott. He has successfully stolen Bellerophon,the cure for the said disease and now needs Chimera to complete their evil plan of killing millions of people around the world.In this mission, IMF assigns Hunt to include Nyah Nordoff-Hall,played by Thandie Newton, a professional thief, for she is the only possible means to get close to Ambrose due to the fact that both are former lovers.A love triangle also ensues as both Hunt and Nyah gets close to one another.The movie is clichéd but it is entertaining in the sense that the action scenes were directed average enough for a typical action film by John Woo.Lots of thrills,fun and excitement were definitely there for action fans as well as Tom Cruise fans.Not too many thinking is needed in the story.A viewer who loves films of this kind will never be disappointed. Everyone knows that the eventually,Ethan Hunt is going to be successful in his mission and he ends up with Nyah when the end credits rolls.Overall,the the second film just like the first film is not at the level of the original classic TV series nor the revival classic TV series shown in the 80's.",Mission - Impossible II

13,Theo Robertson,Entertaining Enough But Entirely Different From The First Movie,6,17 September 2003,"The original MISSION IMPOSSIBLE movie by Brian DePalma was too complicated for its own , so the producers of the sequel have decided to go the other way and give us a film with a wafer thin plot with MTV style visuals ( Lots of sexy slo mo with an intrusive soundtrack ) from John Woo , in short if you liked the DePalma version you`re positively going to hate this one . Tom Cruise`s hero seems to have had a personality transplant since the first film . Remember in the original he lived on his wits ? Well in the sequel his soul seems to have been taken over by Jean Cluade Van Damme , he`s able to do back flips while dishing out a good kicking to bad guys , I`m telling you compared to the hero in this movie Neo from THE MATRIX is a cripple !
A special word of mention to Dougray Scott : I was very pleased when it was announced that the villain of MI2 was going to be played by a Scotsman , and after seeing his performance I was killing myself laughing . Can there be anything less menacing than someone with a Scottish brouge screaming "" STOOOOOOOOOP . PUT A SOCK IN IT "" ? Scott gives a laughably bad performance , but an enjoyable one . In fact the whole film is enjoyable despite being an extremely shallow popcorn movie with lots of explosions and car chases . I much preferred this to the first film . Oh and Tom Cruise did all his own stunts ? Yeah right",Mission - Impossible II
14,LeonLouisRicci,John Woo Never Fails to WowHigh-Styled & Glossy...Extreme Entertainment,8,2 July 2016,"Action Auteur John Woo is in Full Throttle and His Unequaled Ultra-Stylish Fingerprints are all over this Sequel that more than makes up for the Lack of Action in the First Film that was more Cerebral where this one Goes for the Visceral.In Fact, both Movies were heavily Criticized for being ""what they were"". It seems You ""Can't please everyone, so You gotta please yourself.""Woo has the most Graceful, Sleek, and Eye-Pleasing way of Amping Action Sequences just a Notch Above Reality and while Hardly Believable in a Real-World sense, it is all the more Appealing in a Story-Book Template. Woo makes No Apologies in the way He knows this is Not Reality but High-Styled Entertainment.Entertaining it is. A-List Talent all around in this Breath-Taking Behemoth of a Summer Movie-Popcorn Fun. Tom Cruise will Never be Accused of being a Great Actor, but there is Something about His Screen Persona that is Appealing and He seems to Fit the Groove of these things.The rest of the Cast all fall in line as well. The Script (Robert Towne) is Intellectually Stunted and is Minimal in its Concerns for Logic because it is Far Fetched to say the least. The Never Failing to Fail Rubber Masks are an example of the Extreme Suspension of Disbelief that Woo and the Filmmakers Ask of the Audience.The Music is Striking and if Anyone Says You don't get Your Money's Worth with this Pop-Culture Picture than They fall into the Camp of the most Cynical, Jaded, and Grumpy of Contrarians that Populate Current Conventional Film Criticism.

15,zardoz-13,"The First Best Entry in the ""Mission Impossible"" Franchise",9,6 May 2019,"After the hideous debacle of director Brian De Palma's ""Mission Impossible"" movie, Tom Cruise redeemed himself with this exciting, entertaining, and thoroughly exhilarating sequel. If you grew up watching the venerable CBS-TV series that toplined Peter Graves as the head honcho Mr. Phelps, the first movie left a rotten taste in your mouth because Mr. Phelps (the incomparable Jon Voight) treacherously betrayed Ethan Hunt and the rest of the team. The true star of ""MI 2"" wasn't the dynamic Cruise. Instead, famous Hong Kong action movie maestro John Woo took the franchise to heights heretofore never scaled with his stylishly orchestrated action sequences and his flying doves. At that time, Woo was known primarily for his foreign actioneers ""The Killer"" (1989) and ""Hard-Boiled"" (1992), but he had recently come to America and made a name for himself the unforgettable Jean-Claude Van Dame thriller ""Hard Target"" (1993) and then surpassed himself with the John Travolta & Christian Slater saga ""Broken Arrow"") after which Travolta and Nic Cage teamed up for his splendid law & order yarn ""Face/Off"" (1997). Dougray Scott digs his heels in hard as our hero's chief adversary and their showdown on motorcycles is spine-tingling stuff. Thandie Newton plays Cruise's leading lady. ""Chinatown"" scenarist Robert Towne, working from a story by future ""Battlestar Galactica"" producer Ronald D. Moore and ""Star Trek: First Contact"" scribe Brannon Braga, didn't make the same mistake as the origins film.",Mission - Impossible II
16,Boba_Fett1138,"Disappointing, even as an action movie.",6,30 April 2004,"The main problem with ""Mission: Impossible II"" is the simple and uninteresting story that is filled with many plot holes.Not even John Woo can save this movie but at least he still makes it interesting to watch. His style is wonderfully present and the action scene's are truly a work of art. The use of slow motion is superb!Apart from the story the movie also suffers from several other problems. One of them is the cast. Tom Cruise is in his element again as Ethan Hunt but Dougray Scott plays a stereotype villain, he does it in a good way but it's just too simple. I like Richard Roxburgh villain role much better. John Polson's character Billy Baird is nothing short of irritating and on top of that unnecessary. Other problem is that there is absolutely no chemistry between Cruise and Thandie Newton's character, which is I think mainly to blame on the boring and not so talented Newton.Still there are plenty of elements present that make this movie worth watching. Like I said before, all of the action sequences are superb and feel like poetry in motion. The cool soundtrack from Hans Zimmer also make the movie a lot more pleasant to watch. Also the non-stop action ending doesn't disappoint as it in the end turns into an old fashioned good vs. bad guy, mano a mano fight without any weapons. I also quite enjoyed Anthony Hopkin's uncredited small role as mission commander Swanbeck.Disappointing, especially compared to the first movie but still somewhat watchable because of the Woo-ism.

17,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"I know why people want to hate this... and sadly, the complaints are sound",6,2 January 2010,"The first was good as a spy thriller, and poor if considered to be related to the show. When this took such a different approach(heck, upon seeing this, some might have realized how great De Palma's attempt was), I can imagine many being disappointed to see it move further away from the series(I'm referring to the original one, which is what I understand to be the best times for this franchise). This is about what we expect from Woo. He does stylistic action really well, and is famous for his particular brand of it, with use of slow-motion that is so effective that he seriously schools anyone in Hollywood in that practice. At best, they can hope to be a pale imitation. He does, however, require something very important(I mean, apart from someone to tell him that, regardless of how awesome it looks... and it does, I'm not arguing that... agents do not, in fact, do over the top Kung Fu kicks and such). And that is a script. Oh, they had one. One written based around the exciting sequences that he wanted to do. Yeah. That's not a positive thing. The plot holes and continuity errors seem to be the result of the finished thing being cut down to almost half its initial length, but, let's be honest, this was never Face/Off. In place of drama and compelling characters, we get an Ethan Hunt that now just appears to be addicted to the rush, and who does insane stunts for *fun*. While the charm is still there somewhat, it's now about the only likable quality to him. You know, the *lead*. The rest of the cast aren't given many attractive traits, either. This also seriously needed to weed out the concept of using masks; for a bit of it, it literally comes off like every scene ends with someone revealing their true identity(typically only to the audience). That makes an otherwise *extremely* straightforward story excessively convoluted. The acting is reasonable, and the villain is cool enough. Editing and cinematography are well-done. The pacing is a letdown, probably mainly because this thing is not all that engaging. This has a well-composed score, and I personally like the new theme by Limp Bizkit, and fans of them most likely will, as well. For some reason, the music video on the DVD is a Metallica song instead. It has an informative director's commentary track(though he doesn't talk all the time, pity), a handful of well-done featurettes, an MTV parody(that I will review on its own page) and alternate opening credits. I recommend this to those into John and/or Tom's movies. 6/10",Mission - Impossible II
18,view_and_review,A Shaquille O'Neal Free Throw,4,15 August 2020,"When John Woo gets a hold of a movie look out. This man loves slo-mo and romantic action. He'd be a perfect production manager for the NFL. Give John Woo a budget for unlimited slow motion and explosions, and he can stretch an hour's worth of material into two.There was no getting into this episode of ""Mission Impossible."" I already don't like the 007 type of spy: the dapper suave spy who has to fight women off with a stick. IMF agent, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), was that with just a little more athleticism. No, Ethan wasn't surrounded by a horde of women, he just quickly bedded the one, Nyah (Thandie Newton), after a very brief, chic, and unnecessarily action-packed introduction.So, with a strike against it very early due to the suave-spy gimmickry, I wasn't much in the mood for outlandish John Woo-isms. But that's what I got. Ethan Hunt preferred explosions to almost any other means of... well, anything. He used explosions for diversions, explosions to kill, explosions to create new doors--I'm surprised he didn't use explosions to cook his dinner. And there was no end to the explosive material just lying about for Ethan to ignite.If the action was too tame throughout the movie for some, it was ramped up to a hyperbolic level in the last 20 minutes or so. Ethan concluded his mission with a final fight against the main antagonist, Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott). This fight included a game of chicken on motorcycles in which they zoomed toward each other at maximum speed and just before impact they both jumped off their bikes in the air to collide with one another.From there they fell to the sandy earth and locked into an artistic fight that was anything but efficient (where's John Wick or Jason Bourne when you need him). Their lengthy brawl full of significant strikes that yielded no real damage lasted a lifetime. The amount of energy wasted on flip kicks, roundhouse punches, and other ostentatious fight moves could've been used to power a large city.Ethan would eventually subdue his foe due to the power of anger. Sean made a remark about Ethan's new love that was very inflammatory, hence Ethan was able to tap into his anger and defeat Sean. But wait!! Instead of killing the defeated Sean he merely left him in a beaten stupor on the ground. That shouldn't have been a problem, except he left the man right near a gun. UGH! What a rookie move.Sean, being the megalomaniac that he was, grabbed the gun, and instead of just shooting the hero in the back, decided to make a final statement first. ""You should've killed me,"" he said, while aiming the gun at Ethan. At that statement Ethan paused, looked down, and saw a gun at his feet. He kicked the gun in the air, did a horizontal jump twist, grabbed the levitating gun, and put two shots into Sean while Sean shot an airball like Shaq at the free throw line.Oh it was tedious to watch. What juvenile minds was John Woo targeting? I don't know, but somehow he tapped into the pleasure center of many viewers to the tune of $215M. It's amazing how much money explosions, slo-mo, and long fight scenes can net.",Mission - Impossible II
19,Uriah43,A Mission to Acquire a Deadly Super-Virus and It's Antidote,6,2 February 2017,"When a suspected super-virus called ""Chimera"" and its antidote ""Bellerophon"" is stolen by a ruthless former IMF agent by the name of ""Sean Ambrose"" (Dougray Scott), ""Ethan Hunt"" (Tom Cruise) is called upon to acquire both of these products and bring them back to his supervisor ""Commander Swanbeck"" (Anthony Hopkins). To do that he is tasked with recruiting a former girlfriend of Sean's by the name of ""Nyah Nordoff-Hall"" (Thandie Newton) who is also an international thief. What they don't realize is that Sean doesn't actually have the virus and plans to manipulate the IMF to accomplish the task for him and considers everyone involved to be completely expendable. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film had a complicated plot which was convoluted by numerous action scenes thrown in for good measure. As a result the overall film suffered accordingly. That being said, while the movie was still entertaining to a degree, it could have been better and for that reason I have rated it as just slightly above average.",Mission - Impossible II

It causes a massive cell destruction when injected. Tom Cruise returns and is assigned to track down the virus and anti-virus and return to headquarters. Plagued with stupidity such as Tom Cruise scaling a mountain and defying the laws of gravity. There are dumb sexual situation between Cruise and Thandie Newton that come off as corny. And the whole sudden available lifelike masks render no sense at all. How can he have masks of people he hasn't met? Directed by John Woo who can do action as he proved with the far superior Face Off, but that film had substance where as this one is just pure junk. He could have played smash up derby against a brick wall and made more sense than what he concocts here. Cruise is difficult to accept here because he defies logic too much. Scott plays the standard villain who will go down to a fist fight or possible explosion. Newton plays damsel in one of those flimsy rescue scenes. Ving Rhames returns from the first film.

21,FlashCallahan,Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes......,4,14 May 2015,"Ethan Hunt has been sent on a mission to destroy a genetically created disease called 'Chimera'. He must also contest with a gang of terrorists headed by a former IMF agent who has already managed to steal the cure, and now needs 'Chimera' to complete their grand plan of infecting the whole world. In order to infiltrate and locate the terrorist group, he relies on the help of thief Nyah, with whom he quickly develops an interest in. Time is not only running out for Hunt to find and destroy 'Chimera' before the terrorists get their hands on it, but he must also find the cure, so as to save his love interest who has already become infected by the disease from a terrible and rapid death.....John Woo is a wonderful director. His pre Hollywood movies are visually stunning and almost poetic with their action scenes, and Face/Off is arguably one of the most bonkers action movies that Hollywood has churned out in the last twenty years.So it comes as a complete surprise when this movie, despite the high concept, Cruises star power, and franchise name reaches its peak, when Cruise reaches his peak when climbing.It's completely incoherent, allegedly Woos cut clocked in at over three hours, but hey, the studio wanted the money, knew people would see it, and despite the nonsense, it's make bucketloads of money, because the trailer looked brilliant, and Woo was a huge deal then.So what we get is, the obligatory stunt that hinders each movie,man impressive last twenty minutes, but almost ninety minutes of waffle, Scott chewing scenery, and Cruise with his best Zoolander pose in slow motion.It's all eye candy, and really nothing else, Hopkins shows up for a bit of plot explanation, Newton is just there to justify Cruises hatred for Scott, and Rhames comes back for a little comic relief.It beggars belief that the franchise continued after this mess, but rest assured the film went from strength to strength after this.So all in all, it's just a two hour advertisement for Loreal shampoo featuring Cruise.Why? Because he's worth it....l",Mission - Impossible II
22,Aaron1375,This mission soon self destructs from your brain after watching it.,6,19 March 2010,"I enjoyed this Mission Impossible more than the first film. At least I think I do, to be honest I hardly recall the movie at all. Granted it has been since 2000 since I saw the movie, but even if you asked me about it a month after I saw it I would still have trouble recollecting it. In fact, I may have liked it less possibly? Not really, I liked it a tad more only because it had more action in it, but that is really all that it has in it. A much more shallow film that one has to wonder is it even an actual sequel to the original film. Sure Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt and Ving Rhames is back too, but it just seems to be happening totally independent of the first film. The first film may as well not exist as you certainly do not have to see the first film to understand or enjoy what is happening in this one. Or the third film for that matter. The only thing in common these films share other than the name and Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt is that they all are kind of forgettable movies. This one being the most so, basically a summer popcorn flick one quickly forgets upon leaving the theater back in the day. This one has Hunt going after some sort of guy making some deadly virus I think. Do not quote me on that though, the only things I remember clearly about this one is the cool fight at the end between Cruise and the guy that came close to being Wolverine in the X-man movies, but instead chose to do this film and the scenes with the very attractive gal and Hunt trying to recruit her. Oh yes, also the strange and pointless addition of Anthony Hopkins and the rock climbing scene too. Cruise is just an enigma though, he seems like he could star in really good films and I am sure there are a couple of really good ones that I have yet to see, but he ends up playing in mostly forgettable fare. I think the highest score for a film that he has been in that I have seen is an 8 for part three. I only gave it that high mainly because of the addition of a memorable bad guy. Nice one of these mindless Mission films had something that was actually memorable in it. I can not believe they are actually making a fourth.",Mission - Impossible II
23,The_Void,Tom Cruise's show,7,30 August 2005,"Brian De Palma's original worked more through suspense and style than action, but it's obvious that star and producer Tom Cruise wanted the stunts to star this time round, and so action director John Woo was recruited. While the first film was better made than this sequel, the change of focus has actually turned out to be no bad thing, as Mission: Impossible II is a more thrilling and far more accessible film than the first. Really, this isn't a sequel to the first film at all, with the only similarities between the two being that both Tom Cruise and Ving Rhames reprise their roles. I said their roles, not their characters and although the names have stayed the same; the characters haven't. Cruise's capable, yet slightly vulnerable persona in the first film has replaced by a glossy haired, all action terminator, and it's obvious that Cruise was more bothered about how he'll look on screen than staying true to the original. The plot, and everything in the film, plays second fiddle to Cruise's star profile, and while this can get annoying after a while; seeing Cruise tear his way through mountains of enemies has a sort of farcical brilliance to it.As mentioned, the plot plays second fiddle; but surprisingly enough, it's actually not bad! We follow the creation of a genetically modified disease called ""Chimera"" and, of course, Cruise is on hand to dispatch it. One of his former colleagues wants to buy both the disease and the antidote so that he can infect everyone and then sell them the cure! This isn't the most brilliant of plots ever conceived, but it's a lot better than what I was expecting from a film like this. John Woo injects his usual panache to the film, including many shots of the leads in slow motion, double gun shootouts, motorbikes, doves...etc etc. While Woo obviously knows how to direct an action scene, it seems out of place in a film that's supposed to be about daring espionage. The original theme has been given an overhaul too, which is quite fitting since this has recycled just about everything else from the first movie. One idea from the first that's been used and used again is the rubber mask thing. This is good the first couple of times you see it, but after the twentieth time, it starts to get a little old. This is pretty much what you'd expect from an action film, but it takes it's main elements and does well with them. Really, this is a piece of kitsch; but it's an enjoyable one, and it's hard to really hate it.",Mission - Impossible II
24,mm-39,6,6,29 May 2000,"It's ok, but you must like Woo's directing style to like this one. I gave it a 6, no real surprises, by the number action film.  Rent this one, it's nothing special.   The casting could have been done better, but when a actor make like 12 million a movie it seems to hurt casting usually.  If I watched it a couple more times I would like it more.",Mission - Impossible II
25,Mr-Fusion,Less bang for your buck despite the bullets,4,5 August 2016,"""Mission Impossible II"" did _not_ stand the jump from big to small screen. It's one of those movies that puts the chapter-skip button to use. When the guns are holstered, it's a real drag, and that's really the best way to describe this movie. Thandie Newton's subplot just doesn't work, and you find yourself wanting to move ahead to the next action scene. Speaking for myself, that is.To that end, if you have the patience to sit through the melodrama, there's a real charge to the gunfights. The tactical precision of the first film has been replace by dual-wielded Berettas; and it's fun, even today. Using your motorcycle sideview to shoot the guy behind you? That's total John Woo! The man left his mark on the franchise, to be sure - it's just a shame it had to be with such a dull script.4/10",Mission - Impossible II
26,JamesHitchcock,The George Lazenby of the Twenty-First Century,4,28 June 2006,"""Mission Impossible 2"" borrows many of the traditional elements of the trusted formula which proved so successful in the James Bond series. There is a secret agent hero, a psychopathic villain bent on world domination, a beautiful heroine, exotic locations (Seville and Sydney), a ""McGuffin"" which the hero and villain are trying to get hold of and the obligatory car chases. The hero is Ethan Hunt, an operative for a highly secretive US government agency. The villain is Sean Ambrose, a renegade member of the same organisation and the heroine is Nyah Nordoff-Hall, a professional thief and (in a typical Bond-like touch) Ambrose's former girlfriend. The McGuffin is a lethal virus developed by a corrupt pharmaceuticals tycoon and which Ambrose is trying to steal along with the antidote so that he can hold the world to ransom. Although the hero is an American, the villain, heroine and Hunt's boss (equivalent to Bond's ""M"") are all British; Nyah, despite her exotic name and looks, speaks in the tones of an English public schoolgirl. Nyah and Hunt become romantically involved; a rare example of an inter-racial romance in an American film. The film, however, lacks certain essential ingredients of the Bond formula. The Bond films, at their most stylish, are distinguished by a lightness of touch and a careful balance between excitement and humour. ""Mission Impossible 2"", however, takes itself completely seriously and has very little humour. Connery, Moore, Dalton and Brosnan all interpreted James Bond in their own ways, but he always emerged as a rounded, believable character with his own personality. Tom Cruise's Hunt, by contrast, comes across as devoid of personality, comparable only with Bond as interpreted by the inert George Lazenby. Dougray Scott does his best with Ambrose, but he does not emerge as a particularly memorable villain in the Bond tradition. Thandie Newton, who was so impressive in films like ""Flirting"" and ""Jefferson in Paris"", seems wasted as Nyah.This is the only one of the ""Mission Impossible"" films that I have seen, and it has not inspired me to go to the video store to rent the original or to the cinema to see the recent ""Mission Impossible 3"". It has confirmed some of the doubts I had about Tom Cruise. In his early ""Top Gun"" or ""Cocktail"" period he seemed a handsome but shallow matinée idol but then matured into a very good actor in intelligent films like ""Rain Man"", ""Born on the Fourth of July"", ""A Few Good Men"" and ""Eyes Wide Shut"". Unfortunately, he has also shown a tendency to act in some ill-advised vanity projects, often with himself as producer, and these have rarely shown him at his best. Thus we had the interminably dull ""Far and Away"", the virtually incomprehensible ""Vanilla Sky"" and ""The Last Samurai"". This last was not my favourite film, largely because of Cruise's overacting and its regrettable and historically ignorant tendency to glamorise Japanese militarism, but at least making an epic set in the Japan of the 1870s showed a laudable ambition to go beyond Hollywood's normal range.""Mission Impossible 2"", by contrast, shows no ambition at all; it is just a bog-standard shoot-em-up action adventure of the sort that Hollywood's lesser talents can make with their eyes closed. If Mr Cruise must indulge himself in vanity productions, he should find something worthier of his talents than trying to become another Schwarzenegger or Segal. He should certainly set his sights higher than becoming the George Lazenby of the twenty-first century. 4/10",Mission - Impossible II

But come on, only if it's Arnold or Sylvester, not Tom Cruise.

With big budget, big names, and John Woo going for it, ""MI2"" delivers solid entertainment but falls short of expectations.

29,MovieAddict2016,Better than the first...(spoilers),6,6 September 2002,"M:I2 brings back star Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, returning to his role from the first film Cruise seems a bit more confident this time around, and the direction of John Woo might help a bit. This time the plot involves a deadly virus that is going to be sold on th black market. Hunt and his team must hunt down the villians and the virus before it is released.  This time around M:I is more on the side of action than a thick and confusing plot. It's not a thinkers movie, it is an action movie. And while Mission Impossible had some great end sequence action, Mission Impossible 2 delivers action the whole way through, with a pleasurable ending.
 I didn't enjoy M:I very much because I think they either tried to hard or didn't try enough. I found the plot to take too many twists and turns to the point that you didn't really care about the film that much anymore, not because it is confusing but because you do not care about any plot changes, and you just wanted the film to move on and break away from its slow pace. On the other hand M:I2 does the opposite. It moves fast, doesn't have any big twists and turns, and of course with John Woo directing, some very original and interesting fight sequences. The film itself does have flaws, but you do not really care that much because you are having such a good time enjoying the film. The end has non-stop action, leading to a fist-fight/martial arts sequence on a beach that I will not ruin for you.  The acting team isn't as big in MI:1 but Anthony Hopkins makes a nice cameo as Mission Commander Swanbeck, and Ving Rhames returns as Luther Stickell. The main cast listing follows: Tom Cruise ....  Ethan Hunt Dougray Scott ....  Sean Ambrose Thandie Newton ....  Nyah Nordoff-Hall Ving Rhames ....  Luther Stickell Richard Roxburgh ....  Hugh Stamp John Polson ....  Billy Baird Brendan Gleeson ....  John C. McCloy Rade Serbedzija ....  Dr. Nekhorvich William Mapother ....  Wallis Dominic Purcell ....  Ulrich   I would recommend this film to you if you like John Woo films, and/or action films. It's got some great action sequences, some good cinematography ( The beginning sequence proves that) and some overall good acting (despite Cruise's big shot attitude) that makes the film a lot better than Mission Impossible 1. 3/5 stars-JOHN ULMER",Mission - Impossible II
30,DKosty123,Worst Entry in Series,2,3 June 2016,"The biggest problem here is believable. Instead of having the brains that usually get the IMF Mission done, this one has dumb and impossible stunts. The closing sequences are so terribly done that the movie is laughable. Ethan Hunt becomes a James Bond in this one using luck to get the job done.The masks used in this are clever but often stupid. Why would anyone believe that someone who is the wrong body size in a mask would be another person? The mask does not change the size of the body the face is one.The acting in this one of so cliché that it becomes annoying. The plot is predictable, and the stunts are so unlikely, that I am reminded of Los Costello riding roller coaster wheels in front of screens in the later part of Abbott & Costello go to Hollywood, also an MGM film.The only reason I give this anything at all is that I hate to think I wasted 2 hours on pay cable watching a zero film. It is lucky the later films have gotten better, as this one is the bottom of the barrel literally. They should burn the script on this but keep the film for schools as an example of how not to make a Mission Impossible.

32,thesar-2,"Difficult Mission, Different Crew and Better than I",5,10 April 2011,"Man, I didn't care for the first Mission: Impossible movie, but that's another review. Where part one dealt strictly with the spy business and forgetting action almost all together, part II was the exact opposite. (SEE: Mission: Impossible III where they finally got it right.)Be prepared to be bombarded with SLO-MOOOOO scenes and roughly 50 fake-face/gotcha scenes. Okay, 50 is steep, but after the 8-9th time, it'll feel as much. Get past that and you have a decent action flick with a wonderful (so-called – at the time – retired) Anthony Hopkins cameo, the gorgeous Thandie Newton and sly Dougray Scott. Also the score was good and soundtrack was awesome with one of my favorites: Take a Look Around by Limp Bizkit.Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is on holiday (love that non-American way of stating: vacation) when he's called back to duty to get a virus which was produced so there can be a cure. SeriouslyI've seen this several times and never really followed why they needed to create a virus in order for them to have a need for a cure.Yeah, money, duh. But, the initial scientists were working on the right side. Anyways, Hunt has to recruit people for his mission: Nyah (Newton) and his signature buddy, Luther (the always fun Ving Rhames) and someone else that I don't even remember so it doesn't matter. There's double crossing, global hopping and again, slow-motion scenes withdoves (or was it pigeons) flapping around for ""style"" I'm guessing.It's a no-brainer film with some big budgeted scenes.

34,Robert_duder,The Butchering John Woo accomplished,6,20 April 2006,"I might be speaking blasphemy here and probably get a horde of angry emails but I don't care it has to be said...I don't believe director John Woo is much different than Hollywood hated Uwe Boll...complete with a host of video game licenses to their name. While it's true I've never seen any of Woo's work from his early days which is touted as action art but I have seen Windtalkers, Paycheck, Face/Off, Broken Arrow and of course Mission Impossible 2. Woo brings to the table an incredible unique style...TOO unique. He has to make everything with John Woo stamped all over it and tries to make action...art and it's not!! Action is action...it's adrenalin pumping, edge of your seat, holler for the hero...you don't care whether their movements and choreography is beautiful and in the process of making this unique piece of art John Woo lost the magic that was Mission Impossible.Tom Cruise returns as nice guy secret agent, with a bit more of an edge, Ethan Hunt. Hunt definitely is tougher, grittier and yet falls deeply in love in this Mission. He still plays the role well and no one fulfills the screen presence like Cruise. The hair was wild!! Almost unexplainable?? The long, greasy locks was not very becoming and certainly cut back on the clean cut Ethan Hunt we knew from the original. Although tougher and grittier it just felt like his character wasn't as smart and throughout all the wild stunts and fights which are practically 100% done in slow motion, he loses something in his character. Dougray Scott takes the helm as the bad guy, Sean Ambrose. Instead of being Ethan's mentor, this time he is his stand in for many missions and he's tired of being in the shadow. Scott is decent and plays the bad guy well but in all honestly he doesn't stand a chance against Cruise. He never poses a viable threat and you just sit back and wait for him to get his butt kicked. Thandie Newton plays the Mission Impossible girl, Nyah Nordoff-Hall. Ethan falls madly in love with her at first sight, completely out of the blue and then must protect her as she goes deep undercover with her former lover Sean Ambrose. Despite horrible reviews Newton is not AWFUL...she's a million miles from great but she's okay. Her and Cruise have some strong sexual tension but otherwise the romantic chemistry is fleeting. She's kind of whiny and annoying for someone who is supposed to be a strong female and a brilliant thief. Ving Rhames returns as Hunt's partner Luther Stickell and his role is a little bigger this time around which is a welcome addition. He adds to the cast nicely. Richard Roxburgh plays Hench man and bad guy Hugh Stamp. His role is pretty quiet but effective and in fact he might have made a better major villain than Dougray Scott. His suspicious nature and his brutal facial expressions are fun to watch and even though Scott does get the better of him several times it's not believable and you keep waiting for Roxburgh to take him out. And finally giving Mission Impossible that touch of experience and class that Jon Voight and Vanessa Redgrave did to the original is Anthony Hopkins as Hunt's boss. Despite being a relatively small role he has some very effective and memorable lines. ""To lie to a man and sleep with him, she's a woman, she has all the training she needs."" ""This is not Mission Difficult Mr. Hunt, it's Mission Impossible, difficult should be a walk in the park for you."" It's unfortunate he didn't have a bigger role.Parts of Mission Impossible were kept in tact in order to make it as good as the original but in my humble movie going opinion it was the decision of bringing director John Woo on board that made the film nearly a joke. Fortunately with such strong actors, and some decent action scenes the film was pulled from obscurity but just barely. What should have and could have been one of the best fights in action film history between Ethan Hunt and Sean Ambrose in the end turned into some sort of choreographed dance routine done in slow motion with flowing clothing and hair and some sort of half-assed wrestling maneuvers that looked like it hurt them more than the other guy they were doing it too. The idea of a virus being stole was good and also opened up the window for a near replay of Hunt's daring theft in the original and although it wasn't bad as Hunt narrowly dives down into fan shafts, it just didn't come across as well. Mission Impossible II is okay and it's worth seeing if not just because the first was so incredible and hopefully the third will put this series back on track but so far number II definitely falls short of what the original was. The action is less, the romance is overwhelming and a little hokey, the fight scenes are far too dance like and the plot is still a little muddled and you wonder often what's going on. Add into that the cast just wasn't as strong as the original and you have a sub par sequel. Good luck next time!! 6.5/10",Mission - Impossible II

Apparently, we have this to thank for that.",5,29 July 2018,"'Mission: Impossible II (2000)' is not so much a different flavour as an entirely different meal, a cheesy Hong-Kong action movie that makes people who thought the first was too action-heavy for the 'Mission: Impossible' franchise (as it then was) seem downright foolish by comparison. It's so overwrought, so melodramatic and so sincerely self-serious that I think it'd be difficult to actually take seriously even if it had been executed successfully. As it is, the bafflingly-styled and incredibly disappointing picture often feels as though it thinks it's gut-wrenching, Shakespearean high-drama when really it's essentially just shlock. However, while it is certainly a bad film, I can't deny that there's some counter-intuitive enjoyment to be had, especially in the no-holds-barred third act. This bizarre entertainment arises because it's all so stupid and that you can laugh at, not with, the piece every few minutes when, invariably, a moment somehow sillier than the last happens. Like they say, a bad movie is better than a totally boring one, though this does unfortunately have its moments of genuine tedium, too. It does have the best uses of the series' signature masks, though. The fact it takes itself so seriously that it can't be 'in on the joke' is perhaps the icing on the cake, as even a hint of a wink would reduce the flick's already limited 'cheesy' enjoyment. To be clear, I don't particularly like this film. Yet, I don't hate it, either. 5/10",Mission - Impossible II

It is certainly nothing outstanding, simply an enjoyable action movie with some great intense scenes and a story that is both fun and easy to watch. Tom Cruise still hits it out of the park as Ethan Hunt, his on screen charisma makes the movie worthwhile. The film plays it very safe. There is really nothing bold throughout, every single stunt, every last piece of dialogue is a typical action movie cliché. It never tries to be anything special and because of that, never stands out. The very plot itself is flawed, there are many questionable points throughout and it drags on. It is not as straight forward and easy to follow as the first film was, instead it tends to be overly complicated, making sure the audience have difficulty understanding so that they will not manage to discover they made a poor plot. As far as actions go, it is mindless fun. Imperfect, Mission: Impossible II is still an enjoyable action, worth the watch if you ever see it on television, but certainly do not go out of your way to see it. Ethan Hunt is sent on his next big mission where he must find and also destroy a genetically modified disease.Best Perfornance: Tom Cruise",Mission - Impossible II
39,CuriosityKilledShawn,A movie for idiots.,3,12 July 2000,"Many people criticized this movie for having no plot. Which is a result of many people criticizing the first for being too complex. There's just no pleasing some people but this movie could have made up for it by having some class or a formidable villain. Dougray Scott is pretty much one of the worst villains ever and a poor representation of Scottish actors.John Woo uses some wonderful Australian scenery but fails to inject any sense of excitement to the fight scenes. The gun battles look too damn staged and the fist fights are all done in slow-motion, which robs them of any realism or hardcore. Seeing as how this is a PG-13 the action is also pretty damn tame. Which is a shame since Woo is a pro at this. You hardly see any bullets even enter bad guys never mind exit. It's all done off screen. If people wanted tame violence why on earth did they hire Woo to direct? It's a bit puzzling.Although it IS tame it is still darker and harder than the original. But the duff biochemical warfare plot is pure video game crap. I can't believe Robert Towne had a hand in writing this. It's like a rejected plot to a Solid Snake PS1 game. There's seems to be some focus on making it a James Bond/Die Hard wannabe instead of respecting the source material and offering us any iconic or memorable set-pieces.Another major thing that is wrong with this movie however is Zimmer's score. For a movie that is 124 minutes long we get about 30 minutes of music. Zimmer is known for his talent of creating ambient and versatile music. But NONE of that is present in MI-2. This was movie was made around the time of his decline into mass-produced soulless stuff.

John Woo, the director, knows how to get the pulse rate way up! Then, too, Cruise, Newton, Ving Rhames, Scott, and all of the others play cat and mouse very well. Beautiful scenery abounds, as does terrific costumes and snappy conversation. Cruise may not appeal to a few but this action film is first rate.",Mission - Impossible II
42,callanvass,"Tom Cruise's charisma can only take this,overly mind numbingly stupid sequel,so far.",6,29 December 2009,"Mission Impossible II is full of cool looking Action stunts,Tom looks completely cool in his Leather Jacket,long hair,with his sunglasses,yet the film bored me half the time,rather then thrilling me. I have never been a big fan of John Woo's,I often find many of his films to be overblown,and unexciting,in fact the only film I've liked of his,is Face Off. Mission Impossible II is no different. It's overly loud,brash and not sophisticated like the 1st one was. Mission Impossible managed to thrill us,with perfectly orchestrated suspense,here it turns into an action lovers feast. There're shootouts,Tom and Dougray wrestling around on motorcycles,Tom avoiding bullets,unfortunately it's all highly unrealistic looking,and took away a lot of enjoyment for me. The fight scene near the end though,is shockingly well done. Tom showed quite the acrobatic skills,despite no Martial Arts training what so ever,it was all done to perfection. I also enjoyed how Thandie Newton's character was developed. She's completely unpredictable as Nyah|A bit too much at times,if you asked me| mysterious,we never know where she truly stands until the halfway point.Mission Impossible II entertains at some points,but it's just much too stupid for it's own good,completely brainless stuff.Performances. Tom Cruise's charisma is able to make this film a lot better then it should be. He is the epitome of cool here,walking around with a black leather jacket,expensive sunglasses,his hair all done up,he looks like a bad ass. Ethan Doesen't have the depth that he does in the 1st film,and this completely hurts Tom In the long run. Tom,however is able to bring his own brand of acting to Ethan this time around,to give us a character we can root for. His chemistry with Newton was also on the money. Thandie Newton is certainly good looking,that's for sure. As far as her acting is concerned,she managed to do a pretty adequate job,making her character as unpredictable as it comes. Dougray Scott is a decent villain. He's somewhat bland,but managed to get the job done when it counted. Ving Rhames is too cool for school. He added class,just like he did in the 1st. Richard Roxburgh is decent as Stamp,I liked his style for the most part. John Polson is funny as the other team member,basically the comic relief though. Brendan Gleeson is decent in his shady written part. Rade Serbedzija has a memorable accent,I'll say that.Bottom Line. Mission Impossible II is a failure as far as a followup goes. On it's own it's a mildly entertaining sequel at best,I'll say it again,having John Woo at the helm was a big mistake. Worth a look,but don't expect the original,and you might wanna bring some aspirin with you,due to the utter stupidity of the plot sometimes.6/10",Mission - Impossible II
43,Bored_Dragon,"Better than original, or at least more honest",7,21 December 2016,"After the first ""Mission Impossible"", I was thinking to delete the rest of this franchise without watching. But back then I bought the soundtrack for this movie because of the Metallica song that was not released anywhere else. And it was a pretty good soundtrack. Because of music, I decided to give this movie a fair chance and, to my surprise, it was not bad at all. I did not like the first one because it pretends to be a thriller that keeps you in suspense and it pretty much failed in that attempt. I'm not saying this one is more intelligent, but at least it does not pretend to be. This is a typical Woo action movie with lots of chasing, fighting and gunfire and, in own genre, it is really OK. If you don't have high expectations you will enjoy in well-done adrenaline rush scenes and that's all. And it has a cute babe in the lead female role.7/10",Mission - Impossible II
44,ironhorse_iv,"Abort Mission! Abort Mission! This film really is mediocre! Don't bother, seeing this movie! Disavowed this!",5,28 September 2017,"While, the more recent films in the 'Mission: Impossible' series, are highly enjoyable. This movie is not. It's impossible to watch! Although, this 2000 sequel directed by John Woo is far more stylized and action-packed than the first action reboot film directed by Brian De Palma in 1996, also based off the television show of the same name (1966-1973). It's also, a lot more over the top, and cheesy. While, some people might like that, I found it, to be, too much of a dumb repetitive overused rethread that got quickly tiresome. All the flying doves, unrealistic wire-works, dual-wielding pistols, explosive, mirror shots, and ridiculous face masks make it seem like, I was watching the 1997's action film, 'Face/Off', all over again. It barely resembles 'Mission: Impossible'. You would think a spy movie like this, would have cleverer, well-thought out infiltrate scenes like the original. Sadly, it does not. Instead, the movie fill up the time, with clumsy and pointless similar actions scenes of the Pierce Brosnan's 'James Bond' era, such as people in love, nearly running each other, off the road in car chases, everybody shooting at and drunkenly handling the dangerous, fragile McGuffin that can wipe everybody off, the face of the world, as if it's a bottle of booze, and tons of climbing and jumping off things, just there to feed Tom Cruise's ego. It's really lame. Another thing, this movie destroys with its shallow action, is the sophistical twist and turns of the psychodrama that the first movie, established. This sequel's plot of finding and destroy, a genetically modified disease is unique, but it's also, a bit paper-thin & disappointing. I was really, hoping for something more complex. Something in the same vain as 1998's thriller novel by Richard Preston, 'the Cobra Event'. Don't get me wrong, the movie tries to be smart in its unrealistic out of the blue love-story between IMF agent, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) & pickpocket theft, Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton), by copying the classic Alfred Hitchcock's 1946's film, 'Notorious', by having a spy falls in love with a woman, whom arrangement, requires her to get back with her ex, in order to find a dangerous weapon. Yet, the screenwriter, Robert Towne doesn't do much new development with it, so the subplot in this film, come across, more like a rip-off, than a homage. The love story was also so bad written with its over-lovely dialogue that the relationship between Hall & Hunt, became so fake-looking that the couple don't even carry over to the other sequels. Despite that, the acting between Newton and Cruise was alright. The two had some chemistry, but the film doesn't give enough time for the characters, much to click. It doesn't help that the villain for this film, doesn't add much, weight to the triangle. He was highly forgettable to the point that I forgot his name for this review. I had to look it up. It's also sucks, that Dougray Scott's thin Scottish accent makes it, really hard to understand, anything that ex-IMF Sean Ambrose is saying. He was by far, the worst thing, in this movie. Regardless of the villain, Tom Cruise doing 95% of his own stunts like the 'knife near the eye' scene, is pretty impressive. I just don't buy him, knowing martial arts. As for the music score, I have mixed feelings about the soundtrack. I kinda dig the new rock version of 'the Mission impossible' theme song with the guitar rip. However, rap-rock band Limp Bizkit 'Take a look around' version of this song is not good, as the lyrics has little to do, on what happening in the film. It's more of an excuse for Fred Durst to defend and bash his critics for their troublesome music career. Regardless, it's not the only song that seems, out of place. The Zap Mama 'Iko Iko' song from the beginning of the film, doesn't match, the Utah desert-like settling. It sounds more like music, you would hear, in a Caribbean Cruise Line with 1988's 'Rain Man' film, playing the background. Another, out of place tune was the exotic Middle Eastern forlorn music, being played, during the love-scenes. Its seems like composer, Han Zimmer was taking a day off, and just gave the leftovers/unused music tracks from the 2000's historic film, 'Gladiator'. It really doesn't match anything, that happening on screen. It's also equally as bizarre to hear music, here, that Zimmer would use in director, Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight' trilogy (2005, 2008 & 2012). Overall: All the jarring flaws, this movie, has, proves, without a doubt, in the end, this is one mission, you shouldn't accept. Just avoid. You're better off, not watching it.",Mission - Impossible II
45,The-Sarkologist,Rather Dry & Dull,4,24 September 2021,"I really wasn't all that impressed with this film, but then again there is really nothing about it that basically sets it apart from the countless other spy thrillers that happen to be out there. Mind you, considering that the franchise is still ongoing, they obviously did quite well, but the problem is it just didn't really grab me in the way that other actions movies grabbed me.Honestly, there isn't much difference between this film and the first one, namely because we are dealing with rogue agents from the IMF organisation. This time they have basically stolen a bioweapon, which they are planning on selling to the highest bidder. Tom Cruise was supposed to escort the scientist that had the weapon, but because he was on holidays they ended up getting somebody else to do it, who unfortunately happened to be the rogue agent.This is another one of John Woo's films, and while I would suggest that he had sold out by this time, I never really considered that to be the case. Anyway, moving to the United States generally does mean that you have somewhat lesser creative control over your films, and they probably offered him the position because he does do some pretty awesome action sequences, or at least he was well known for his action sequences back then.Honestly, there isn't much else that I can say about this film, other than the fact that it was filmed in Sydney. Then again, despite being Australian, having a movie filmed in Sydney doesn't really grab me the way that it used to grab me. Actually, come to think of it, I believe this film was made back in the days when Hollywood loved filming in Australia because it was really cheap. Mind you, it does seem as if those days are now behind us.",Mission - Impossible II
46,slightlymad22,Style Over Substance,6,8 October 2017,"Mission Impossible 2 (2000)Plot In A Paragraph: Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is sent to Sydney, to find and destroy a genetically modified disease called ""Chimera"".The first movie, whilst criticised for being too confusing was a really good action/thriller. Sadly Mission Impossible 2 is all style over substance. It's just a lot of stunts, stunts and more stunts. Who cares about such things as plot and character development when the actors look cool doing cool stuff. According to Robert Towne, his script was written around action scenes that John Woo had already planned. And sadly it shows in the movie. It's full of plot holes. The mask thing became tiresome too!! Doing this movie (his first sequel, not counting Colour Of Money) did gave Cruise the freedom to experiment with more offbeat choices like Eyes Wide Shut and Magnolia. So when they don't perform at the box office, the damage was minimal and it was not career threatening. Mission Impossible 2 grossed $215 million at the domestic box office to end 2000 the 3rd highest grossing movie of the year. The highest grossing Tom Cruise movie at that point.",Mission - Impossible II

48,tomgillespie2002,Hollow and incredibly boring,4,4 August 2018,"John Woo was already a highly acclaimed director by the time he transferred his trade to Hollywood. With the likes of A Better Tomorrow, The Killer and Hard Boiled, produced in his native Hong Kong, he had earned his reputation as an action maestro, one capable of delivering a gun-fight with balletic grace, almost like watching poetry in motion. His Hollywood career started off okay with Hard Target and Broken Arrow, two forgettable if sufficiently entertaining vehicles for Jean-Claude Van Damme and John Travolta. He went up a couple of gears in 1997 with Face/Off, an outrageous thriller with two off-the-leash central performances, and it felt like Woo had finally worked out the formula of translating his chaotic brand of action and humour for American audiences. That was all before Tom Cruise suggested him for the follow-up to Brian De Palma's nifty thriller Mission: Impossible. M:I-2, as the posters branded it, not only manages to be completely hollow, but incredibly boring.While De Palma made some controversial changes to the formula of the original TV series, the first Mission: Impossible still embraced much of what was loved about it. It was grounded in a world of espionage and secret government departments, with Tom Cruise's relatively inexperienced Ethan Hunt at the centre of the unravelling plot. Woo throws the majority of this out of the window in favour of something more flashy and violent, changing Hunt from an opportunistic rookie to a leather-jacket wearing superhero capable of gravity-defying kicks and physics-defying driving. When we first meet him, he's free-climbing in Utah, in what is the movie's only heart-pounding moment. It establishes this new Hunt as a fearless adrenaline-junkie, and when he finally makes it to the top, he is handed his next mission, should he choose to accept it, via a pair of soon-to-be self-destructed sunglasses. The mission is to track down and retrieve a deadly virus stolen by rogue IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott). To assist him, Hunt must also recruit professional thief Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton), who also happens to be a former flame of Ambrose.After the baffling plot of the first Mission: Impossible, it's something of a relief that Woo chose to keep things as simple as they are here. With films like this, the story only really serves as a way to get us to the next set-piece. The major issue is that Woo and writer Robert Towne (of The Last Detail and Chinatown fame) fail to inject any life into their characters, or at least give us anyone to root for. I like Tom Cruise and have nothing but respect for his desire to do all of his own stunts, but this smirking, floppy-haired version of Ethan Hunt comes across as a bargain-bin James Bond. Dougray Scott, who is one of the blandest actors around anyway, isn't helped by his one-note villain. Ambrose is simply an evil version of Hunt, only without the hero's plot armour. By the time Ving Rhames and John Polson are brought in for the final showdown, it's all too little, too late. By this time, Mission: Impossible II has already established Hunt as a one-man army, who naturally finds the time to romance his prettiest recruit when she's not busy trying to run him off a cliff. All of this could be forgiven if the action was on point. Guns are pointed dramatically and the camera swirls in slow-motion, but not even the obligatory flying doves can save M:I-2 from yawn-inducing mediocrity. It was a smash-hit at the box-office, but it's reputation meant that it would take six years for J.J. Abrams to save the franchise from an early demise.",Mission - Impossible II

51,cruise01,John Woo's direction can be a little ridiculous with its action but better than the first.,7,25 July 2018,"Mission Impossible 2 (3.5 out of 5 stars).Mission Impossible 2 is a stylized explosive action film that brings a little freshness into the series. And an improvement over a dull first movie. Tom Cruise is back and better than ever. The film does pack a little punch with action which the first movie was lacking. The plot follows Ethan (Tom Cruise) being assigned to go after a rogue IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott). Who steals a chimera virus and plans on making profit with the cure. Ethan is going to need help from Sean's ex girlfriend Nyah (Thandie Newton) who is a skilled thief. The plot has a twist or two that will throw off the audience with surprises. Especially with the spy gadgets like facial mask to disguise themselves as somebody else. The action sequences can be ridiculous in this film. With John Woo's stylized direction. Kind of has a spaghetti western action scene with Woo having white doves flying between the hero and villain. And slo mo scenes with characters giving stare downs with flames between them. Also, cars explode easier in this movie when they barely crash into another. But I am sure all this is for summer entertainment at the movies. With a thrilling opening sequence with Ethan free rock climbing to Nyah and Ethan having a showdown in their sports cars racing on the side of the mountain. Then, there is another stunt with Ethan repelling down to a secured building which leads to a firefight. And another climatic showdown with a motorcycle chase and Ethan going face to face with Sean. Dougray Scott was good as the rogue agent. With a performance that looks like he has anger issues and is about to snap at any given moment. Thandie Newton was okay too that spies for Ethan. While Brendan Gleeson playing a character that works for a biocyte pharmaceutical company that created the virus. His character was dull and undeveloped. But good thing he was only in it for a small part of the film. Ving Rhames returns as Luthor, Ethan's sidekick and tech guy. The music score by Hans Zimmer does bring some energy to the film mixing the theme song with a fast paced rock score. Overall, Mission Impossible 2 is a pretty fair film. Better than the first movie. The action sequences are exciting and ridiculous. Have to keep in mind it is one of those blockbuster type of films. John Woo's direction can be a little cheesy with its style of white doves flying between characters or slo mo stare downs that try to build suspense. The plot is good which does slow down a little bit in the second act but picks back up with a wild bike chase and a fight sequence in the climax.",Mission - Impossible II
52,TheMovieDiorama,"Mission Impossible 2 is set on slow-motion ""Tom Cruise"" control.",5,9 March 2019,"De Palma's film adaptation of the television series knew what it was. A fun, slick spy thriller that acknowledged how ridiculously crazy it was. Woo comes along for the sequel, with his more serious tone, and instead of chanting ""woo hoo"" he sees audiences chanting ""booooo hooooo"". Completely unrelated to its predecessor, Ethan Hunt is tasked in bringing down a thug who plans on releasing a dangerous virus for money.A generic story that could've come from an earlier Bond flick, but atleast it's functional. Occasionally engrossing, especially after the tediously dull first half which sees a woman being used as bait, with consistently good performances from everyone. Cruise harnesses the physical prowess of an IMF agent, and Newton is just stunning. Their romance is somewhat underdeveloped and all too forced, however it gets the job done. Zimmer's score also seems a little out of place during certain scenes, almost acquiring this spiritual vibe. Small criticisms here and there.The major critique however is the film's pacing. When the most exciting scene for the first hour is a one minute montage of Cruise climbing a cliff, something is not right. The action, or lack of, is then diminished entirely by the obnoxious use of slow-motion. Nearly. Every. Thing. Is. So. Damn. Slooooow. The plot is about an hour, yet the film is dragged out for two hours just so we can see Cruise twist and twirl in the air in choppy slow-mo. The style is fine for certain scenes, but to overuse it actually detracts from the thrilling action, consequently making it boring. If anything it made me admire Cruise's luscious locks as it slowly flows in the gentle breeze. The antagonistic rogue IMF agent, played by Scott, wasn't exactly memorable and weirdly concludes with a showdown on a beach. Mano-el-Mano. No wait, sorry. Manooooo-el-Manooooo. Thankfully the preceding motorbike chase was filmed well, so there is something to take away. Everyone knows this is the weakest in the series. Limited action and a long drawn out generic plot isn't exactly a success...",Mission - Impossible II

Tom Cruise once again delivered at least a satisfactory performance, along with all other actors involved, but John Woo's direction was a little bit excessive at some points. I fail to see what made it necessary for Hunt to be riding his motorcycle on the front wheel while firing at an oncoming car. Or how about that gun that was lying in the sand toward the end of the film? Was that a little too unrealistic, or was it just me?The story was good, the acting was convincing enough, and the action sequences were well put together, but they were just too much. One of the other things that really saved this film from action-packed obscurity was some very clever and well placed dialogue, particularly on the part of Ving Rhames, back once again as Luther Stickell (""Ethan! Nyah is in the building! Do you copy!"")Despite M:I 2's shortcoming's, it will undoubtedly be very satisfying to the true action fan. It has explosions, gun fights, car chases, lethal viruses, Jackie Chan style fight scenes, and even a hint of a few WWF moves in those fights. Mission: Impossible 2 is a good action film.

55,Vartiainen,About as decent as the first one,4,24 September 2014,"The first Mission Impossible was a fun little action romp and one of the few films where I could stomach Tom Cruise as an action star. One of the few would also include this second installment in the franchise, where Ethan Hunt (Cruise) has to join forces with a professional thief Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) in order to stop a deadly virus from falling into hands that would turn it into a weapon.I think I prefer the original over this one, mainly because it had a slightly rawer edge to it and had the novelty on its side. This movie feels just the slightest bit safer than the first one, and we don't really learn anything new about Ethan, though he remains as likable as in the first film.The sequel also maintains all the good elements. The excellent action scenes, the phenomenal special effects (at least for their time), the fun characters and the plot lines that are fun and silly, but not too much to distract you from the action.If you liked the first one, I urge you to give this one a watch.

I'm finding as I have reviewed literally hundreds of movies here at IMDb, that those which gross highest at the box office aren't necessarily the highest rated films. That in itself is peculiar, in my opinion.Take for example, Mission Impossible 2. It had an increased budget ($125M as compared to MI1 which had a budget of $75M) and took in $545M (as opposed to MI1's $452M worldwide estimate), yet MI2 rates a 5.7 while MI1 rated a 6.6 among users here at IMDb. Isn't that interesting? It made more money, sold more tickets, yet was an inferior movie.""Sequels, by definition alone, are inferior films."" Randy, Scream 2I found this work playful, innovative, and fun. It was not, however, as edgy or fresh as the first. MI2 tried too hard to be ""hip,"" or cool, and it just came off as another ghetto flick in spite of the stellar performances, well choreographed and executed action sequences, and interesting plot turns.This sequel obviously rode the coattails of its original in the hopes that MI1 was strong enough to carry a weaker installment. Obviously that tactic worked. My question is, ""Will MI1 also be expected to carry MI3?"" I surely hope not, or the next installment could be the death of the franchise.This rates a 6.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",Mission - Impossible II
57,elshikh4,Goofy Little Bond !,5,29 January 2009,"It's not bad, it's only goofy!(Tom Cruise) was having the worst of times, in 2 years he didn't make anything but (Kubrick)'s big turkey (Eyes Wide Shut - 1999), and it wasn't worth it too!, needing a box office hit badly. So how about the great TV show that he participated in disfiguring it 4 years ago under the name of (Mission: Impossible) or (The adventures of James Bond's short American brother). Therefore, let's make (Disfiguring: Part 2)!(John Woo) seems so happy to work with Mr. Hollywood (Tom Cruise) himself, directing a Mission Impossible flick (it's like having the American citizenship!), being on a mission to rescue (Cruise) from the bomb that (Eyes Wide Shut) was, at any cost. But (Woo) here was more like a director of nearly 10 video clips, showing off his technique, enjoying creating something visually catchy at every one of them, though they are still clips. The real problem was that he freely gave everyone and everything a bigger shadows, so with smaller script; they seemed all funny!OK, for instance, he was highly sentimental in the wrong place, or by the wrong way; (Cruise) falls in love with (Thandie Newton) during a Spanish dance in slow-motion like living a poem, rolling on a cliff at their cars like a ballet, both have sex while some public exuberant ceremony, Oh like fate is conducting the relationship as heavenly music, or a great rapt love that was meant to be. Surely (Cruise) will dump her like trash before she knows about it in the next movie! It runs in the family, as his older English brother used to do during 40 years already. The funniest bit when (Cruise) had to hug her at one park in the end, after he saved the world, while no sound around them but the holy moment of their true love; Oh Nonsense!The script wasn't respectable enough. Look at the first scene that gathered the 2 leads together (the attempt to steal at the hotel), the script just cut the scenes where we're supposed to understand that (Cruise)'s character is disguising as security's manager just to get right to the action part! Actually it looked naïve, before anticlimactic. But not to wonder. As (Robert Towne) had declared that much of his script was written around action scenes that (Woo) told him he wanted to direct?? That makes clear that this was the most toy of a movie for (Woo).Let alone how (Cruise) is not that convincing as Bond, or as action hero in the first place, whatever all the moves he does, all the motorcycles he rides, and all the sunglasses in the world! I even can't believe that he may be a result of an affair for (Bond)'s father in America with some short girl; he's close to be a (Bond)'s son only by correspondence! So, farewell for any credibility (read: unity with the lead).I hated that Russian scientist character who got nothing to do but saying one of the drama's rules ""Every search for a hero must begin with something that every hero requires; a villain!"", (Thandie Newton) was here only for being ""the girl"", though she didn't have enough charisma or charm. It got more ironic while the way she was portrayed cinematically like a dream. To add all the fuel, there was no whit of chemistry between her and (Cruise), like they were a team of (Bud Abbott) and (Bud Abbott)! So, for me, one of the movie's highest absurd points was seeing the good guy and the evil guy, fighting madly over her. Fairly, I think she's a real good actress, but she didn't fit for nearly everything in this.So, the script is a little childish, and with (Cruise)'s presence, plus (Woo) being seriously romantic in a video game, it's ""very"" childish. The whole matter shrank into another crazy B-movie with shattering glass, cool yet fool chases, and one long jump into one building, managing not to be a spy movie, or kind of decent thriller like Part 1, or a case of ""one-team, one-mission"" a la' the original TV show which was originally murdered since the beginning, and nothing remained from it else the game of the masks! Even the director's trademarks, such as the slow-motion during the action, seemed silly, meaninglessly repetitive, and sometimes laughable with the doves while (Cruise) rises; it looked like a perfect spoof indeed especially with that operatic soundtrack!I'm sick of reading information like ""The film's final cut clocked in at 3-1/2 hours. So the studio balked, and the final length was abbreviated to 120 min""! I read the same thing about other flops like (The Avengers - 1998), or (Daredevil - 2003). It's flimsy excuse for the plot holes, and flimsier excuse to sell the DVD!Lastly, what could be good in this?

58,freemantle_uk,The weakest of the Series,4,6 September 2009,"After the commercial success of Mission Impossible in 1996 it seemed that America had a spy film that could rival James Bond, and Hollywood being Hollywood, a sequel was inevitable. Here was a vehicle for Tom Cruise that had served him well. In Mission Impossible turned from a spy thriller to an completely out and out action extravaganza; but the film suffers for it.The plot (what their is of it) is about a Russian scientist, Dr. Nekhorvich (Rade erbedija), a former agent of Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), injects him with a new supervirus Chimera, hoping to give it to the Americans along with the antidote. But ends up being murdered by former IMF Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) and crushes a commercial plane into the Rocky Mountains. Sean Ambrose plans to sell the virus to the bidder, with pharmaceutical companies and terrorist jobs the main bidders. It up to IMF and Ethan Hunt to do this. Ethan is required recruit theft Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) to fake a relationship with Sean so they can find him.The plot and story is too simple, too stupid and basically can't compare to either the first or third film. The dialogue is terrible, and the script is full of plot-holes. Non-American nationals are also treated in a stereotypical way and they so many needless actions scenes, like the car chase in Spain. What is really surprising is the writer for the film was Robert Towne, who wrote Mission Impossible and has an impressive filmography, like Chinatown and Bonnie and Clyde. It didn't even seem like a sequel to the first film because it style, story and just so many changes made in this film. John Woo was hired to direct. He is a man who is a talented action director, but he is a man who needs to work in Asia because his style is more suited to Hong Kong cinema. He is also a man who needs strong material or else his films fall flat. Most of his Hollywood efforts have been weak. There are some strengths; the action and the material arts are very well done, and properly some of best in the series. It is not overly edited or any shaky cam that affected the enjoyment of the second Bourne films. They is also a delicious amount of violence in the film. But even with the action scenes some area where so over the top it was ridiculous and John Woo really enjoyed using sparks to simulate bullets and enjoyed repeated shots of the same scene. There are some element's of Woo direction I liked. I did enjoy his trick of using classical music over action scene, but I do dislike the over use of slow motion.Now to the acting. Tom Cruise seemed to be on autopilot in this film. His heart wasn't in it like it was in M:I and M:I III. They was a lack of chemistry with Thandie Newton and she is weak compared to her high standards. Dougray Scott was a decent villain, but he isn't as good as actors like Jon Voight, Kristian Scott Thomas and Philip Seymore Hoffman who enjoyed roles in the series. Scott had also suffered career wises, he was due to play Wolverine in X-Men but the film shot overshot and lost the part of Hugh Jackman and was in the running to be the next James Bond. Now Scott hasn't been in anything good for a long time. Ving Rhames, normally a very good actor, was really just comic fodder in this film. I also thought Australian actor John Polson was not good in this film.They is excellent music by Hans Zimmer, who is one of the best composers in the movie industry at the moment.Finally, the whole series is schizophrenic, neither knowing whether to be thriller based or action based or even what it's setting is going to be. Mission Impossible was set as a black ops division of the CIA (the best setting), M:I II, Ethan Hunt pretty much a lone agent for some sort of international group, and M:I III which IMF was an independence organisation. Some coincidence wouldn't go a miss.** out of *****",Mission - Impossible II
59,dfranzen70,Mission: Impassable,6,14 November 2000,"From the crash-bang school of LOUDER IS BETTER comes this sequel to the latest Tom Cruise blockbuster, or the Big Movie Du Jour. Not that Tom's incapable of small films (okay, maybe he is), but making a sequel to a loud action film is about as overdone as.... well, making any sequels, frankly. And we all know how good those sequels can be, don't we? (Okay, Toy Story 2 notwithstanding.)You remember Ethan Hunt of the Impossible Missions Force, don't you? Last time we saw Ethan, he was having a bear of a time keeping his team alive - and finding out if they were on his side or not. This time around, he's asked by his boss (an unbilled Anthony Hopkins) to recruit a thief (Thandie Newton) to assist in some covert viral espionage. Ethan thinks the girl's being hired for her thiefing skills, but turns out she's the former lover of the stereotypical Megolomaniacal Bad Guy (who, of course, is a former colleague of Hunt), Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott). Her mission, should she choose to accept it, is to reingratiate herself with him and find out what she can about a brand-new, man-made organic virus called Chimera, after the mythological beast. Whenever an action movie tries to be authentic, it incorporates someAll flash and pomp, this movie has plotholes you could drive a souped-up Hummer through. With a ear-shattering soundtrack designed to make you forget the story's a bunch of hooey, M:I-2 deftly distracts its viewer. (It's even more riveting on DVD, where the sounds are even crisper.) Why have a plausible plot twist when three or four explosions will do? Sure, I'm nit-picking. That's what I do. Critics (professional or amateur) pick nits. You could certainly watch this movie and be suitably entertained. I guess it always irks me when a movie takes 90 minutes of plot and stretches it to 120 minutes by using music and explosions. And that's not to say that the action scenes aren't elaborately and masterfully staged.Some of the acting is really unbelievable, including Scott and even Cruise himself. It's one of those going-through-the-motions motion pictures, albeit the kind where the star is getting $20 million and relies on special effects to bail him out. Didn't these people bother to read their lines before rehearsal? Oh wait, I forgot - there's no need for Method acting when duelling motorcycles will do. And did I mention the love scenes? Who does Cruise think he is, Sean Connery? It's bad enough M:I parrots nearly all of the Bond films regarding the international locations and explosions galore, but now Hunt has to be the Casanova to end all Casanovas. Yes, I'm quite aware he's a hunk and all that, but let's remember - he's probably shorter than you. Being in front of a camera can add inches to your height as well as to your weight!You might get the impression here that I wasn't too fond of this film. Au contraire, mon frere du cinema! While it's not Shakespeare, it's also certainly not Stallone. For that, I bestow copious kudos to the filmmakers, who decided not to completely dumb it down to us. And hey, if we would rather not be distracted by a tortuous plot, so be it. So enjoy: it's solid entertainment, not too bad for a sequel.",Mission - Impossible II

61,mjneu59,"certainly diverting, in an empty sort of way",5,7 December 2010,"The second entry in what promises to be a reliable series of action-packed blockbuster diversions is, for better or worse, pure popcorn: an adrenalin-driven, quintessential summertime crowd pleaser. The franchise at the time showed none of the formula staleness of its obvious role model, the James Bond adventures, despite sharing the same exotic international settings, the same megalomaniac villains, and the same beautiful, willing bedmates. Plus (of course) a similar superspy hero, played by producer Tom Cruise, using the role to show off all his favorite hobbies: rock climbing, high-speed ballistic driving, designer sunglasses, and so forth.Never mind the convoluted plot, which is just an excuse for an unlikely but exhilarating series of clockwork chases and cliffhanger stunts, the latter earning expatriate Hong Kong director John Woo a lot of praise for their balletic choreography (from people who, apparently, don't remember Sam Peckinpah). The film is surprisingly bloodless for having such an impressive body count, with all the colorful, comic book violence making it easy to enjoy, if almost impossible to recall in detail afterward.Thandie Newton is the token love interest, and a capable foil to Cruise's strictly juvenile machismo, until the inevitable moment when she's reduced (almost on cue) to just another damsel in distress. And the typically glossy presentation will likely impress anyone with a weakness for high-tech gimmicks and gadgetry; if nothing else the film provided ample employment for the best technicians in Hollywood.",Mission - Impossible II
62,alindsay-al,a really poor attempt at a spy thriller,3,13 October 2014,I must admit that I did like the first mission impossible film quite a bit but this film is just poor in anybody's book. This film sees the return of Ethan hunt as he looks to stop an old ally from releasing a deadly virus on the world. Now I really did like tom cruise's performance in the first film but something just seems a bit off with him in this film. I mean he still does a decent job but he just seemed lethargic and not really interested. The side characters are a mixed bag with both the villain and his main henchman being more like cartoons then realistic representations of what villains should be in a film like this. But I thought Ethan's New love interest nya did a good job and she has pretty good chemistry with cruise even tough the story does make it hard to believe. Also another thing I liked is that they gave ving rhames's character luthor a bigger role in this and I believe he does a really good job easily being my favourite character in the film. In the first film one thing I really liked was the story and the twists and turns they took but in this film there is no such luck. The story is unnecessarily complicated and none of the reasoning for actions are ever really explained at all. The script is okay with hunt and nya having some good dialogue between them but also none of the villains had any good lines and a lot of the dialogue did feel forced. But easily the biggest complaint I have with this film is its style of the film. There was so much slow motion it became insulting and it really took me out of the film. This film is a massive let down and makes me look less forward to the 3rd film.,Mission - Impossible II
63,MaxBorg89,"Awesome action scenes, lame script.",6,7 May 2006,"The opening credits sequence is excellent: Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) climbs a mountain with his bare hands; once he reaches the peak, a chopper shows up, shooting a missile on the ground. This missile contain a pair of sunglasses, thanks to which Hunt receives instructions concerning his new assignment, followed by the famous line ""This message will self-destruct in five seconds"". He then tosses the glasses away, their explosion forming the movie's title. That scene, alongside the spectacular motorbike chase, is M:I:II's highlight. Otherwise it's just an ordinary, predictable and pretty stupid action flick.This time, Hunt and his partner, Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) have to stop their former colleague Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) from infecting the world with a deadly virus known as ""Chimera"". In order to succeed, they need help from Nayah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton), Ambrose's ex, who's now dating Ethan. You can easily guess the rest...Like his predecessor, Brian De Palma, action guru John Woo favors style over substance. But De Palma had a good script to work on. Woo, on the other hand, hopes the audience won't notice the narrative flaws, so that he can offer us his visual trademarks (slow motion, doves etc.). Unfortunately for him, we do notice the flaws: for one thing, the love story is quite insipid, and it's also given too much room (no prize for guessing how the film ends: it's SO obvious!). In addition, the characters stink: Nayah is still passable, but new sidekick Billy Baird (John Polson) was completely unnecessary. Why not just leave Luther alone? And Ambrose is a crappy villain: in Scott's hands, he looks like a stereotyped caricature of a respectable bad guy. Still, Cruise and Rhames make a great spy couple, and Anthony Hopkins'uncredited cameo as Hunt's supervisor is very enjoyable, particularly his infamous remark: ""Mr. Hunt, this isn't mission:difficult, this is mission:impossible. ""Difficult"" should be a walk in the park for you."" Pity the same can't be said of this film's director.",Mission - Impossible II

Woo forces his signature traits between the sprockets, but that only makes them seem outrageously gratuitous.

71,a_chinn,John Woo leaves his stamp on his one Mission: Impossible film,7,25 June 2018,"I remember after seeing this film being very excited about what I though was going to be a unique action series where each installment would be directed by a distinctly different director who would leave their own unique stamp on the series. The first film was directed by master of suspense Brian De Palma and this first sequel in the series was directed by John Woo, the most famous of the Hong Kong action directors, who brings his ""heroic bloodshed"" type of story and action to this mega budget Hollywood production. Woo's best films, or at least his best known films, are ""The Killer"" and ""Hard-Boiled,"" both stories about two men on opposite sides of the law, but who in many ways live parallel lives. The story here has echos of that sort of mano a mano battle between two ying and yang type of characters, but not to the extend as Woo's Hong Kong pictures. Now I'm writing this review couple weeks after having watched the film and I'm barley remembering the story, which kind of makes sense since according to co-writer Robert Towne (Star Trek writers Ronald D. Moore & Brannon Braga received story credit) said that much of the script was written around action scenes that Woo told him he wanted to be able to direct for the movie. What I do remember of the story is that Dougray Scott is the bad guy who has some sort of deadly bioengineered disease and it's up to Tom Cruise and Thandie Newton to stop him. Although it's not all that memorable of a story, and this was reportedly a conscious decision by the filmmakers due to the criticism of the first film received regarding it's overly complicated plot (which it was), but what is memorable about MI2 are Woo's directorial stylistics. All of his usual trademarks are presents; zooms, slow motion, people firing two guns, birds flying in slow motion, etc. and although the action is not nearly as wild as anything in ""A Better Tomorrow Part II"" or ""Bullet to the Head,"" it's unmistakably a John Woo action scene. I remember being disappointed in the action at the time, but rewatching it now, I can appreciate all that Woo did bring to the film. Woo also brings a number of memorable non-gunplay sequences, including a car chase between Cruise and Newton early in the film, which plays out more like a dance than a William Friedkin or Walter Hill style of car chase, or the climactic fight between Cruise and Scott on as rocky seashore that's a wonderfully loopy genre mash-up; part Hong Kong heroic bloodshed, part spaghetti western, and part straight-up American fight scene. Woo's first cut of the film came in at three and a half hours, which is obviously not the film that was released, but how fun would it have been to see that director's cut of an epic length John Woo film with all the budget and trappings of a major Hollywood studio allowing him to indulge in slow motion tracking shots of big name stars in their sunglasses, or close-ups of clothings, or birds, or whatever else Woo felt needed to be added to build his sense of atmosphere and cool? The movie was also originally given a R-rating and had to have the violence edited down to a PG-13, which is another reason it would be fun to see Woo's three and a half hour crazy violent version of this film. And interestingly, Woo was not the first choice of director on this film. Cruise originally offered the job to De Palma, but he declined. The job then went to Oliver Stone, who if you remember has not always done heady dramas, but wrote come classic action films including De Palma's ""Scarface"" and Hal Ashby's ""Eight Million Ways to Die"" but Stone had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts when Cruise's ended up having to work an extended amount of time on ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" directed by Stanley Kubrick, who was notorious for the length of his shoots. Overall, MI2 is absolutely a John Woo films, even if it's a bit watered down for mainstream audiences compared to his Hong Kong films, and although ""Face/Off"" is still Woo's best American production, MI2 is a solid credit to Woo's filmography and I would argue is better than ""Broken Arrow."" (I'm not mentioning ""Hard Target"" because I have a pretty big soft spot for that film and it may be my favorite of Woo's American films, even if I can't quantify an argument as to why it's a better film - maybe it was Wilford Brimley riding a horse in slow motion.).",Mission - Impossible II

Good wins.,7,4 November 2000,"I know the criticism I'm about to make is not a deep one, but really: it would have cost them NOTHING to make the medical science more plausible, so why didn't they?  Inaccuracies range from those research would have cleared up (viruses use RNA, not DNA), through those a moment's thought would have cleared up (how can a virus which is fatal in less than two days, and almost impossible to transmit, cause an epidemic?), to those which are just loopy (how can there be a disease which becomes incurable after EXACTLY twenty hours, to the MINUTE, whatever the sex, size, age or initial state of health of the person infected?).Anyway: it's still amazing stuff.  All that heart-stopping rock climbing at the beginning and slow motion photography - PROPER slow-motion photography, which never feels as if it's dragging its heels. At once exhilarating and suspenseful.  My only previous exposure to Woo had been the execrable ""Face/Off"".  It goes without saying that this film is a hundred times better.  (It IS a mystery to me why people were so excited about it in advance: as I said, Woo's previous Hollywood effort had shown no grounds for hope at all, and it's not as if anyone liked the original ""Mission: Impossible"".  I guess it's one of those hype things I'll never understand.) -Sure, the token woman was very hard to take: an unlovable drifter of no fixed abode or accent, and if she was REALLY in love with Ethan Hunt, I renounce any claim to being able to read anyone's state of mind.

75,lewiskendell,What should be impossible is making a movie this ridiculous.,3,3 July 2010,"""Just stay alive. I'm not going to lose you.""What was John Woo and Tom Cruise thinking? Or should I say, what were they smoking? How could they have not realized what a disaster they were involved in making? If I would have seen this at a theater, I don't know if I would have walked out after 15 minutes, or if I would have stayed just to see how much more absurd this thing could possibly get.Mission Impossible 2 is nothing like the first movie or MI:3. For starters, those movies were actual good. The script for MI:2 was absolutely horrendous. We're expected to believe deep relationships exist between characters because they met, talked for all of 5 minutes, had a random car chase, and then immediately had sex. Some (most) of the dialogue was embarrassing to hear; I'm almost certain that it had to be just as embarrassing to say. Tom Cruise just grinned his way through the movie. Thandie Newton was completely wasted. The villain was too generic for me to even remember his name. The rest of the cast might as well not exist.  John Woo went waaay overboard with ""stylistic"" flourishes that are so ridiculous that they were genuinely funny. I mean, some of the stunts and action set-pieces are just surreal versions of what a 10 year-old boy thinks would be cool. Pointless slow motion. Doves. More pointless slow motion. More doves. And yet, somehow the movie was still boring. It shouldn't be possible for a movie with this many explosions and shoot-outs and absurd scenarios to be dull, but they somehow pulled it off. I guess that counts as an accomplishment. Congratulations?Mission Impossible 2 was just dreadful. It's not stylish, it's a cheesy, over-the-top in all the wrong ways, string of ridiculous, artistically empty scenes. It could have been campy fun if it would have been presented in a tongue-in-cheek manner, but Woo was dead serious about all this nonsense.

Cruise is assigned to convince Thandie Newton to embed herself (literally) with former lover Scott to determine how an eminent professor died en route to a safe haven after discovering a mutant, deadly virus.Gleeson plays a greedy pharmaceutical magnate who wants to purchase both the virus and the antidote to control supply and demand; Hopkins is wasted in a minor role at the bookends giving Cruise his fantastic orders. The villains are suitably swarthy but clichéd, Roxburgh's Afrikaaner accent not sufficient to convey as intimidating, a point driven home when he squeals like a débutante after having his pinky 'tipped'. Ving Rhames is also on-side, sharply dressed with a joke or two to match, but no substance or bearing on the outcome.Stunts are the main game, and they're so over the top as to be utterly laughable, so too is the misplaced Woo signature of the white doves. I accept that Woo conveys a unique style, and indulges in an artistic approach, unfortunately someone seems to have tampered with his canvass and paints on this occasion. Let's be clear, this isn't James Bond, it's just poor imitation and perhaps a pointer to why the next instalment was six years away - though still not long enough to forget this debacle.",Mission - Impossible II
77,brando647,Two Mind-Numbing Hours of Slow Motion and Explosions,4,23 January 2016,"I hadn't seen this movie in years and, with all the ROGUE NATION excitement last year, I sat down and revisited MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2. I'd seen it in theaters back in the summer of 2000 and I vaguely remember enjoying it, but not as much as the first film. Watching it again more than a decade later, I see just how lame it really is. As a fan of the series who's excited to see it doing so well now that we're five movies in, I was disappointed to go back to MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2 and find myself bored out of my mind. It's a prime example of throwaway entertainment. The action is dull, the characters are bland, and the stakes never feel important. Directed by action maestro John Woo, the focus is on style while plot and characters take a distant backseat. In his second big screen mission, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is assigned to retrieve a genetically modified form of influenza that kills its victim within 24 hours. It (and the matching antivirus) was stolen by fellow IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) who's gone rogue and plans to use it to embezzle money from the corrupt owner of the company that created it. Part of that plan is, of course, to release it on the unsuspecting public and reap profits while innocents die. To get the inside scoop on Ambrose's plans, Hunt recruits the man's former lover, Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) to reignite their relationship and report her findings to Hunt and the IMF.I honestly can't believe Roger Ebert gave this movie a positive reviewGeez, where to begin? I guess the action and John Woo's ""style"". From the little bit of his work I've seen (i.e. a few of his American projects), I'm just not a fan. He can certainly craft an intense action scene but he's also got a lot of trademark visuals that he uses to nauseating extremes here. No, not his doves. The dove doesn't appear to the very end of the film. The slow motion. So much slow motion. It's used everywhere in this movie and all the time. Eyes meeting across a room? Slow motion. Eyes meeting between drivers in a high-speed chase? Slow motion. Walking? Slow motion. Jumping? Slow motion. Slow motion? Slow motion. Run this film at normal speed and you could probably fit it as a one-hour M:I television special with commercials. And then there's the gratuitous use of explosions. I love a good movie explosion as long as it's motivated. In MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2, if a car so much as hits a speed bump too fast it's liable to explode in a blaze of glory. Personally, vehicle crashes are more interesting without the explosion because you get a better view of the impact, rather than another identical (improbable) fireball. MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: 2 is first and foremost an action film, but when the bullet wounds are bloodless and vehicles explode for seemingly no reason it feels cheap and pandering like toilet humor in non- funny comedies.It all made sense when I was watching a promotional puff-piece for the film and writer Robert Towne explained that he was approached with a series of action set-pieces designed by Woo and Cruise. He was asked to write the script around the action. As a result, we wind up with a weak story of Ethan Hunt and his team chasing a vaguely-threatening MacGuffin and a forgettable villain. I don't know much about IMF operations and hiring practices but you'd think someone would've noticed Ambrose was getting ready to go full-blown villain. As much as an IMF agent is expected to endure in the course of their job, you'd think they'd have team psychologist to check in on them and maybe realize that they had a psychopath in the field. Ambrose falls far short of being an awesome antagonist on the level of Jon Voight in the first film or Philip Seymour Hoffman in the third. We know nothing of his motivations other than he wants to be rich and he has zero qualms about killing entire populations to do so. To get at Ambrose, Hunt is forced to recruit Nyah and use her as bait. WhichOKbut once Ambrose's location was discovered, why not pull Nyah out and go all IMF on his base of operations? Isn't that their job? Instead, she gets to play spy, putting her civilian life in danger to report information that Hunt could've obtained with one of his crazy awesome IMF infiltration missions.So many complaintswhat can I say positively about MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2? Tom Cruise continues to be awesome as Ethan Hunt. I love the work he's done in this franchise and the fact that he insists on doing his own stunts is impressive. The opening with Hunt free-climbing is that much more intense because we can see it's Cruise on the side of that rocky cliff-face. Ving Rhames is always a cool presence, even if his character is one-note in his fashion obsession this time around. And the M:I theme got a nice rock upgrade for this film. Still, you're better off skipping this one and moving on to MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 3.",Mission - Impossible II
78,moviewizguy,A Kenetic Thrill Adventure!,7,15 August 2007,"IMF agent Ethan Hunt has been sent on a mission to retrieve and destroy the supply of a genetically created disease called 'Chimera'. His mission is made impossible due to the fact that he is not the only person after samples of the disease. He must also contest with a gang of international terrorists headed by a turned bad former IMF agent who has already managed to steal the cure called 'Bellerophon' and now need 'Chimera' to complete their grand plan of infecting the whole world. In order to infiltrate and locate the terrorist group he relies on the help of an international thief Nyah of whom he quickly develops a love interest. Time is not only running out for Agent Hunt to find and destroy 'Chimera' before the terrorists get their hands on it.Wow, I have finally finished the Mission Impossible trilogies. Starting with the third and ending with the second. Weird, isn't it? Now getting that out of the way, there's another problem: I've seen the last thirty minutes on television without watching the whole movie. Yeah, I think watching the ending and watching the third movie before the rest would affect how I would like this film.Still, I liked the film. Well, it is as good as the first if not better than the first. Fortunately, the plot is easier to understand in here and there are tons more action sequences. I really can't stop saying it. This is a truly an exhilarating action/spy film and it's a worthy sequel. Yeah, I knew what was going to happen before they were going to happen because I've seen parts of it before but this was still an entertaining movie for me.I got annoyed with this one problem though: It's when characters take their masks off revealing another character. Each film has this kind of scene but they kind of overdo it in this one. Another is with Ving Rhames just caring about his shoes and tuxedo whenever people make a scratch on them. I also didn't think that Thandie Newton was a good love interest for Tom Cruise. But to say for their performances, they were good.The cinematography was really well done and the score was really relaxing. This felt like a laid back film. It wasn't all too serious and had some humor in it and you can't deny you wouldn't expect some clichés and cheesy one liners in here. The locations in the film was also very beautiful. The action sequences were amazing and thrilling.I can say this film was as good as the first film and has great action sequences. It's a perfect popcorn movie for those who haven't seen it yet and it's entertaining, although it isn't as close as the first or third Mission Impossible films. Fasten your seatbelts because you're in for a kinetic ride!",Mission - Impossible II
79,shakercoola,Mission remake: Notorious,5,13 August 2018,"With a curiously similar plotline to Notorious (1946) this sequel offers much action and balletic violence and a familiar John Woo last act set piece. It's overblown, overcooked, and there is much less intrigue compared to the first mission. A descent in a vault has nowhere near as much tension as the first film. That said, Thandie Newton is winsome; Cruise is very capable as the spy trying to thwart a lethal disease outbreak; Dougray Scott is there to ensure the melodrama is maintained.",Mission - Impossible II
80,mjw2305,More of an Action Movie than a Spy Thriller,8,13 October 2007,"Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is back, and this time John Woo is in the directors chair, which can only mean one thing.Mission Impossible II still keeps some of the spy feel found in the first incarnation, but this time its interlaced with some brilliant action sequences and some original stunts sequences that are great fun to watch. I think what impressed me most about this film was the fight sequence near the end, it really did seem very realistic considering the training and background of the characters involved.To carry the action along, a good storyline is introduced, that is both compelling and clever enough to keep our interest throughout.With a few old faces and the introduction of Thandie Newton and Dougray Scott, the cast is again pretty solid; all in all this second incarnation bears almost no resemblance to the original series, yet it still entertains purely as an action picture with some substance.I found it to be a thrilling ride, and i enjoyed it more than the first film 8/10",Mission - Impossible II
81,Howlin Wolf,"If you saw the trailer, then you knew what you were gonna get..",8,7 March 2001,"The trailer was filled with nicely choreographed action sequences, cool one liners and various beautiful people set to a rocking soundtrack. I have to ask, if that didn't look like it was gonna be your thing, then why see the movie? It patently looked nothing like the first film (which was also excellent) so people decrying it as 'just another action movie' have missed the point of the entire exercise, I feel.I don't usually like John Woo's style, too symbolism-heavy and stylised for my tastes, but it works surprisingly well here, probably because the main part of the film is spent probing the characters. There are some great set-pieces, beautiful cinematography and a first-rate cast. Cruise does a complete character transformation from the first film and emerges as a creditable action hero. Thandie Newton is great as always, both as eye-candy and because she's a talented actress, and Dougray Scott is largely brilliant as the villain Ambrose. Makes me think he would have made a great Wolverine in X-Men (although Hugh Jackman IS absolutely perfect for that role) Anthony Hopkins even appears for a perfect cameo, an even better Jim Phelps than Jon Voight was in the first movie!I think the fact that it's so markedly different from the first one makes it a more enjoyable experience to watch them together, since they're both different types of movie. I would agree that the plot here is perhaps a bit TOO simple after the mind scramble that was M:I, but at least it's interesting, regardless of whether it was filched from Hitchcock or not. If you're gonna pilfer from anybody, best that they be a recognised genius... !Ultimately, M:I-2 is a summer 'event' movie that delivers in spades. If you come across the trailer and LIKE it, then the movie's even better; if it leaves you cold, then don't watch the movie!",Mission - Impossible II
82,btreakle,Mission impossible 2,8,24 July 2020,This sequel was as good as original. Tom Cruise and Ving Rhames were very good in this spy thriller. Anthony Hopkins also has a supporting role in this film,Mission - Impossible II
83,pyrocitor,Enjoy the ride,7,17 October 2004,"For all who have seen the first Mission: Impossible film, it becomes rapidly clear that M:I2 gives almost no sense of it being a sequel. This could be interpreted as either a good thing or a bad thing - it's true that the sense of intrigue and constantly twisting plot of the original is lost. In M:I2, the plot is fairly simple, and each twist becomes clear far before it happens. But enough plot is still decent, as IMF (Impossible Mission Force, hence comes the franchise title) agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) races to stop rogue agent Sean Ambrose (the ever excellent Dougray Scott) from obtaining a killer virus called Chimera, after the monster from Greek mythology. To get to Ambrose, he recruits Ambrose's ex-girlfriend Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) to rejoin her ex, and act as the 'inside woman' for the team. This develops adequately enough, leading to the necessary insanely complicated aerial acrobatics, which are strongly reminiscent of the first film, and a bone crunching motorcycle chase to enormous man-to-man fistfight at the finale. Not too profound perhaps, but for an action movie, it's not bad.The script is very hit and miss; it's true there are some excellent and endlessly quotable lines strewn throughout, but we get stuck with a lot of overly dramatic clunkers like ""We just rolled up a snowball and tossed it into Hell"", which would be easier to overlook, had the cast put more enthusiasm into their performances. Indeed, Tom Cruise acts as if it was not his choice to return this time round, and Ving Rhames as computer hacker Luther Stickel is equally uncomfortable in returning. But Dougray Scott is consistently excellent as dastardly villain Ambrose, and Thandie Newton, Richard Roxburgh as Ambrose's chief henchman and Brendan Gleeson as a crooked industrialist working alongside Ambrose all give great performances.There is also an unexpected cameo from Anthony Hopkins as Hunt's mission commander Swanbeck, which would have worked better had he been developed into more of a major character, giving Hopkins more to do. As it is, he is good-natured enough with his fleeting minutes of screen time, and he's given some great lines, much in the line of M from the Bond films.Speaking of Bond, when did Hunt turn into his carbon copy? In the first movie, the filmmakers worked hard to keep the two secret agents easily distinguishable, but now Hunt seems like a pale shadow of Her Majesty's finest agent. The love plot is handled entirely in the style of a Bond movie, cheesy innuendo and all, Hunt's relations with Swanbeck are entirely the same as how Bond reacts to M, and there's even a car chase through the mountains plundered directly out of Goldeneye. Thankfully, further into the film, Hunt starts to develop more of his own personality, but there's a strong scent of Bond all the way throughout.The directing, which in the original was smooth and effortless, is sped up and choppy in the sequel. Director John Woo plays to his strengths here, but overindulges his fetishes for slow-mo and kung fu moves, making the film seem simply ridiculous at times. Even for a secret agent, it is more than impossible to take as much physical punishment and perform as many gravity defying martial arts moves as Hunt does at the film's climax, and do we really need to see a slow-mo shot of Hunt walking towards his car? Clearly, realism has left the building, (particularly in the end showdown, which is entertaining to be sure, but one can't help but laugh as Hunt pulls off far too many martial art tricks on his adversary) and it's more glaringly obvious in M:I2 than most similar action films.But in spite of all my criticism, I enjoyed this movie a lot. Because it is essential, quality film-making? Definitely not. But what it is, is some good, old fashioned, BIG LOUD FUN. Our over glorified hero takes on and defeats countless enemies while performing breathtaking stunts to the sounds of a consistently excellent blaring rock soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. What more can you ask than that? M:I2 was a genuinely entertaining blockbuster which supplied all the car chases, explosions, shootouts and death-defying stunts to make a truly excellent action film. Who really needs all that other stuff, like story or script anyway?-7/10",Mission - Impossible II
84,Prashast_Singh,Highly entertaining action movie.,10,27 October 2018,"I feel this movie is quite underrated. While it's not as complex as the first one and the plot is comparatively much easier to understand, MI 2 has its own positives, especially its action sequences. Tom Cruise shines in this one too, and John Woo has extracted a good performance from his cast. The film is a good combination of action and espionage, making it a remarkable action entertainer. While certain twists in the film were exciting, what made me the most happy is the film's action. The climactic action block is excellently cut and the fight choreography places it in my list of best action movies of all time. Recommended watching if you love action movies.",Mission - Impossible II
85,PatrynXX,One of those rare movies that kicks better butt than it's predecessor,10,15 December 2000,"I'll admit I was skeptical about this movie at first.  And in fact it took until today to finally watch it.  I was one of the minority I guess that thought the first one had a great plot.  I still like the first one.  But the sequel is a wee bit more Bondish than the first.  I however did find Anthony Hopkins a bit out of place.  I had assumed ....  Eugene Kittridge would be the head boss now.  But that was not to be.The first half hour of the movie is rather slow, and it takes about 24 minutes to get to any main characters. One suggestion... don't watch this on video.  It would be better on DVD with a stereo hooked up to it.It has John Woo's unique slow motion shots throughout and does get annoying I suppose, but I liked it.  They don't really have the tearjerker type thingy going on like the first.  (SPOILER...... to the first one included)which as everyone knows Emilio gets his rather abruptly as well as everyone else.  and Claire as well in the end.The good guys body count is much better here.    Dougray Scott I've seen twice before.  First as a rather wimpy camera man in Deep Impact and then as a kewl good guy in Ever After.  I will admit, I much prefer Mr. Scott in Ever After than to MI 2 but Woo made him into an excellent villain here.I am disappointed that the end of the movie contained some rather unoriginal music.  I'd heard it in The Rock and my dad was telling me before I watched the movie that it originally came from a Bud commercial.  Stick the music where it should be will yah..  Don't recycle it.  Other than that I loved the score.....  get the DVD 10/10",Mission - Impossible II
86,baumer,the last half an hour is great,6,26 May 2000,"Marketing is like magic.  It really is.  This film was marketed to look like it was action packed from beginning to end.  Kudos to the marketing guys for doing so.  They have to be considered similar to a David Copperfield. Copperfield can give you the illusion that something is there or something isn't.  The trailers for this film do the same.  We are led to believe that MI2 is going to be your typical summer action flick with explosions, car chases, mano-a-mano fight sequences and anything else that will increase your pulse.They lied.The trailer also promises you that John Woo is here to replace a stagnant Brian De Palma in the director's chair.  It also screams to us that it is not going to be like the first one.  It is going to be better.HAH!  What a load of crap!First let's talk about John Woo.  This man has a visual style that is matched by no one.  His propensity to direct a good action film is not challenged in today's Hollywood.  But this is also a man that is in love with the slow motion button on his camera.  We usually see slow motion in everything from people eating a sandwich to reading Shakespeare to yawning as the sun passes overhead.  It is overkill and although I can admit that he is a great artist with a broad stroke in action sequences I also have to say he does not know how to create tension in other areas of his work not involving action.  It also has to be said that I think he is in love with Thandie Newton.  Okay, sure she is beautiful.  But I do not need a close up of her in every shot.  After a while it gets incredibly cumbersome and it tries to dehort you from the inequities of the rest of the film by having her face take up the entire 60 foot screen.  I can understand doing it at first, but come on, 20, 30 times in the film?  It becomes cataclysmic and tiresome.The first film was verbose and silly in some ways, but this one is void of any real action until the final thirty minutes and the director and his camera are in love with the female star.  If Woo likees her that much why not just show her naked once, get it out of the way and then move on.  How many shots, how much film was wasted trying to get her in the perfect light with just the right amount of hair hanging in her face and so on and so on? Too many.But back to the crux of my complaint.  There was very little action here and that is funny.  The final 30 minutes of the film is some of the best action probably ever filmed.  The motorcycle chase was breath taking, the fight scene was tense and exhilirating and the break in by Cruise into the fortress where Sean is negotiating his deal left me awestruck.  That is where Woo excelled in the film.  But what of the first 90 minutes?MI2 has a great climax to the film but that is all it has going for it.  I am actually giving it a 6 out of 10 because of it's style and energy at the end.  But frankly I was bored with the rest of the movie.  If as much energy was put into the entirety of the film as went into the end, and into showing how beautiful the female lead was, then this would have been a great film, as it stands, it is a mediocre one.Prediction:  MI3 in 2004",Mission - Impossible II
87,kevin c,BORING BORING ACTION,2,27 February 2002,"Action films are so dull. They've had their day, and that was the 1980s.Added to the tedium, you have some awful acting. Scott is fast becoming one of the worst actors around. It can be no coincidence that he was in the equally awful ""Gregory's Girl 2"". Cruise can, and has done better. Does he really need the cash?",Mission - Impossible II
88,hnt_dnl,Inferior sequel,3,3 November 2008,"John Woo has directed some good movies (FACE OFF, BROKEN ARROW), but MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE 2 isn't one of them. MI2 is the stylistic opposite of the brilliant, underrated ""original"" MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE (directed by the great Brian DePalma), which managed to maintain the claustrophobic tone and mood of the original MI 1960's TV series whilst updating it with all the modern techno gadgets and still be full throttle excitement. MI2 is a classic example of a sequel that doesn't live up to the original. Big surprise.Quite often in Hollywood, sequels are directed by completely different directors with mixed results (JAWS 2, DIE HARD 2, THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, the post-Burton BATMAN movies, EMPIRE STRIKES BACK). OK, the last example (EMPIRE) is a film considered (by some) superior to its predecessor (STAR WARS), but c'mon! There's still a large contingent of folks that prefer the fun, no-holds-barred, in-your-face action of STAR WARS to the downbeat, serious tone of EMPIRE, myself included. MI and MI2 is a good example of this. While original MI (made in 1996) is pure entertainment and fast-paced fun, this movie MI2 is overlong, dull in many parts, and really a standard Hollywood action flick.The always-reliable Tom Cruise is sadly stuck in this tripe that continues the sage of our hero Ethan Hunt as he is on holiday mountain-climbing when new IMF chief (played by unbilled Anthony Hopkins, who is not in the film enough for me). A rogue IMF agent Sean Ambrose (played by a not-too-scary Dougray Scott), disguised as Hunt in one of those masks made famous in the original film, has stolen the antidote for the chimera virus from a doctor friend of Ethan's and plans to sell it on the black market, but first he must steal the virus itself to use it on a major population (Sydney, Australia to be exact, the primary setting of most of the film's action). The cure is no good without something to cure! That pretty much sums it up, except for a dull love story between Hunt and three-named master jewel thief Nyah Nordoff-Hall (played by the beautiful Thandie Newton). I'm sorry, but sex and love stories ruin good action films and this one drags it down. The original kept things simple and the love story (such as it was) to a bare minimum; this one should have as well. There is all this sappy background music while we watch Hunt take down the bad guys near the end flashing between Hunt and Nyah dying from the disease that Ambrose has infected her with as part of his revenge (Nyah dumped Ambrose before she fell for Hunt). A love triangle in an MI action flick? Good times!*cough*BEING SARCASTIC*cough! When watching it, I was thinking of the total ripoff of Hitchcock's greatest films (secret agent gets party girl that he secretly loves to do the government's bidding by using sex, a la NOTORIOUS; but the most obvious ripoffs are from the classic NORTH BY NORTHWEST: double agent female caught between 2 lovers, dangerous mountain scenes and chases, 2nd-in-command to the big bad guy with an unnatural, possibly-more-than-platonic connection to his boss and of course guarded of him and suspects the femme fatale is up to no good, etc., etc.Also the action itself is that standard slo-mo John Woo stuff. Slow-moving motorcycles, slow-moving fight scenes, slow-moving bullets. Boring, boring, boring. And when I watch a movie with really bad guys like these (infecting a major population with a deadly virus), I LOVE to hate their guts, but for some reason, I couldn't muster up barely an ounce of hatred for these guys. I guess they really didn't scare me all that much. Jon Voight was a much more scary, diabolical villain in MI; I as the viewer really enjoyed watching him get his in the end; when Scott got his here, I just didn't care. Pretty much sums up my feeling about MI2.",Mission - Impossible II
89,vip_ebriega,'Mission': Acceptable.,6,13 October 2007,"My Take: Impressive action-with-style save the rather tepid script. Departing from Brian DePalma's thickly-plotted (but actually more satisfying) original, Hong Kong action god John Woo took over the mission DePalma chose to accept, and while the movie is less plot, more action with emphasis of Woo's trademark style, this sequel lacks the sort of class and brilliance of its predecessor. Although many regards DePalma's original as ""confusing"" or ""trivial"", I much prefer the original over this flashy, globe-trotting sequel. Still, there are some moments here and their, but sadly, most of them happen during the climax (which probably prompted me to give this film at least a ***). MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II (aka MI:2) took the plot less seriously. But the problem this time is the plot is the one missing now. It has a plot that I hardly cared about, which leaves the film with a lot of dumb things going around. What we're left is an edgy, bloated action picture that has fun with its cool visuals and stunts without thinking about common sense. Just put ""dumb"" right in the middle of ""action"" and ""movie"" and enjoy the action-packed material.Tom Cruise is back as CIA agent Ethan Hunt, sent on another mission to retrieve and destroy a genetically modified disease called the ""Chimera"" before it falls into the hands of the bad guys. The bad guys are lead by Sean Ambrose, played by Dougray Scott. Thandie Newton provide the lead female (I wouldn't call her the damsel-in-distress for she has a lot to do to be one) and Vhing Rhames is back as one of Hunt's old buddies.The film's director is Hong Kong action director John Woo, who really knows how to make action movies, oriental or not. MI:2 may not be as triumphant as his other action bonanzas like FACE/OFF, but he still gives the action enough grit and cool to be notable. There are some neat car chases and loud motorcycle drives, but not only in the action sequences can Woo shoot good. There is one scene in the movie where Ethan Hunt walks through a dark corner and makes noise, scaring a couple of doves flying, in slow-motion. This wasn't an action sequence, but it's shot well to be just as terrific as one.For good summer fun, MI:2 is not a bad choice. Yes, it's dumb. Yes, the plot does nothing more than string together Woo's stylish stunt sequences together, but it looks good and it does feel good. If only it were any better. Rating: *** out of 5.",Mission - Impossible II
90,fmarkland32,Mission Unwatchable...,2,3 September 2006,"John Woo contributes his worst movie to date in giving us the sequel which could quite possibly be one of the dumbest movies ever made. Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt, a secret agent who this time must keep a chemical agent out of the hands of the usual goons while using all kinds of phony disguises and explosive sunglasses in this assault on the brain. Mission Impossible 2 is John Woo's worst movie. Worse than Hard Target, worse than Blackjack, worse than Once A Thief. (And I enjoyed HT and found some merit in BJ) Where do I start? Well for one an action movie must have well, what is it i'm trying to say, uh, that's right! Action! It needs action and MI2 has hardly any. We get one at the beginning, we get one in the middle and we get one at the end and in between it is some of the dullest plot angles ever recorded. The action sequences are also largely lame with Cruise seemingly in love with himself and it goes without saying the climatic battle between him and Dougray Scott (The guy from Ever After?)is one of the most unintentionally hilarious climaxes ever. Indeed in theaters when Cruise and Scott hit each other in mid air everyone in the theater howled with laughter. Unfortunately had this movie had more amusement I may have actually woke up. MI2 is where Woo stopped being respected and if you don't heed my warnings and see the movie, you'll see why.* out of 4-(Bad)",Mission - Impossible II
91,jhclues,John Woo: The Name Is Action,9,10 July 2000,"Tom Cruise and director John Woo team up for the high-voltage, heart-stopping, edge-of-your-seat action thriller `Mission Impossible 2,' a non-stop rush of excitement that grabs you before the credits even begin to roll with the pulsating vibes of Hans Zimmer's terrific score.  Once again, Cruise stars as Ethan Hunt of the IMF, called into action by his boss, Swanbeck (Anthony Hopkins), when a plot involving a deadly virus is hatched by former IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott).  Hunt first has to recruit a professional thief, Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) to help him get the information he needs to avert a disaster that could ultimately put millions of lives at risk.  Once he has her, the IMF team goes to work; and when they do, they take you with them on a ride that doesn't end until the screen goes dark. 	Simply put, Cruise has never been better; he's matured since the first `Mission Impossible,' and turns in an outstanding performance here, imbuing Hunt with a believable invincibility that gives a luster and credibility to his heroics throughout the film.  Scott is exemplary, as well, and makes his villain and the evil he concocts real.  And Newton is charming as the intrepid Nyah, who first catches Hunt's eye, then proves what she's made of when she becomes an integral part of the intrigue.  Add this to the expertise that Woo brings to this project, and the result is one unforgettable movie.  Working with a superb screenplay by Robert Towne, he takes just enough time to set the plot in motion, and once it starts, it just doesn't stop.  His choreographed action sequences are extraordinary; the motorcycle chase is worthy of any Steve McQueen ever did, and the climactic fight between Hunt and Ambrose should set a new standard for the entire industry.  His use of slow motion interspersed throughout the action is highly effective, and so well done that it heightens the impact of the inherent drama, as does his attention to detail.  Woo more than covers all the bases, and with this work proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that he is one of the finest, if not the best, action directors in the industry, past or present. 	Ving Rhames returns as Luther, and adds that extra spark to the overall proceedings with another fine performance.  The excellent supporting cast also includes William R. Mapother, John Polson, Dominic Purcell and Richard Roxburgh.  `Mission Impossible 2' is a rare and special contribution to the action genre; it fairly rips through the screen and takes no prisoners. It's all here, from the trade mark true- identity-hidden-behind-the-mask to the familiar Lalo Schifrin theme (rendered this time around by metal-rappers Limp Bizkit).  Superior in all ways to the first `Mission Impossible,' this is nothing less than a triumph for Cruise; and John Woo, thy name is Action. For the future, their mission together, if they choose to accept it, is to deliver `Mission Impossible 3.'  In the meantime, don't miss this one; it is one wild trip.  I rate this one 9/10.",Mission - Impossible II
92,educallejero,"Like the original, overall it works. Good movie.",5,14 June 2020,"For the first hour it seemed destined to be an improvement on the original, basically because we have less pointless terrible characters to start the movie, just the important ones, and a much better score. The script maybe slightly worse, but with enough intrigue to make it work.But after that first hour, the movie starts to get less intelligent and more pure action, which is very good, but it gets repetitive and generic fast. The problem of mediocre characters is not resolved. The villain is clearly worse. The script loses a bit of attention to details and twists to let the action shine.There some plotholes with the main issue of the movie the disease, and the criminal abuse of the ""mask and voice chip"" to trick someone. But still, overall, it works and gives us what it promises. Good movie, but that's it.",Mission - Impossible II

I don't care what anyone says, if you don't have good writers, just quit the movie. The lack of plot and story just killed it for me. The dialogue was choppy and, at times, totally pointless.

The acting seems even more wooden that is allowable for the genre, and the characters are two-dimensional. For an action movie, it has way too many boring, snooze zones.

From Cruise's incredible rock climb to nail-biting motorcycle ""joist"" this movie impresses with the stunts.  The plot could be written on the back of a postage stamp.  However, that's rarely what audiences go to see films like this for.  The performances are above average, particularly Dougray Scott and Thadie Newton. A pity Newton's character is underused during the second half of the film. Besides being beautiful, this woman can ACT! It is also refreshing to see a demonstrably romantic and affectionate interracial relationship portrayed on screen in such a positive manner. Newton's race never comes up in the film.  Credit producer Tom Cruise for this one. This is one of those movies I'd rent to give my home theatre system a workout.  This movie succeeds on its own level; however, I can understand how others could be disappointed.

These 2 hour Mission Impossible films don't really seem to have much more plot to them than the old 50 minute TV series did, and it bugs me that they are just Tom Cruise vehicles, whereas the original series was more interesting because it used an ensemble cast--Peter Graves was not all there was. Also it was annoying how much physical punishment Tom Cruise can take and still keep moving effectively--I know this is supposed to be over-the-top, but it was way, way too much over-the-top here. Overall, I kind of wished I hadn't wasted 2 hours on this, but in the end I'll know doubt watch all of the Mission Impossible Movies-- the first one made no sense, the fourth was pretty solid, this one was disposable, so I guess that only leaves number 3.",Mission - Impossible II

As pompous and uproariously stupid as MI2 is, it's compelling, kinetic and stylish - there's more artistry involved in this bombastic flick than it's immediately obvious.Plot unfolds like Notorious on cocaine - I still have a hard time believing scriptwriter Ben Hecht, who penned the screenplay for Hitchcock's classic, wasn't credited in any shape or form here. For Woo, it's an intriguing starting point to play with his action figures, including Tom Cruise, the world's most popular G.I. Joe, surrounded by a remarkable cast. Luscious visuals with sharp colour palettes, balletic fights and a masterful homage to another auteur like Michael Mann are reasons enough to enjoy MI2.The Mission Impossible series remains one of the most interesting sagas still unfolding - not for its narrative arc, which is flimsy at best, but for the triumph of gorgeous set pieces, each time with a different master action director at the helm.7/10",Mission - Impossible II
102,The_Movie_Cat,"""This is not mission difficult Mr. Hunt, it's Mission: Impossible""",4,12 July 2000,"WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SOME MAJOR SPOILERS. DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM!Antony Hopkins bookends this film with a brief cameo as Ethan's boss. I dunno about you, but I find it hard to watch the actor nowadays without being constantly reminded of an advert he did for a certain bank, where everything was 'big'. ""There's a big bloke with a big bald head and he's eating a big bag of sweets making a big noise. Then there's five big girls having a big chat through the film and one's got a big smoker's cough and she's hacking her guts up in a big way. Then there's a big idiot who left his big mobile phone on and it's letting off a big ring"". Yeah, the cinema can be an annoying place sometimes. But back to the film. There's a line of dialogue where Hopkins describes how by using a female thief on the mission they will reward her by deleting her criminal record. The record, he tells us, will be ""expunged"" (pauses, then adds for those who don't know expunged means) -  ""wiped out"". The whole film is like this. Every time a vaguely clever plot point is revealed, the movie then immediately spells it out in bright big letters just for the members of the audience too thick to get it.It's films like this that make you think you've either seen too many movies or that it's just blindly obvious what's going to happen next. This is no more apparent than with the wearily predictable series of face/voice doubles (c. Face/Off), the worst being Tom, running for his life, yet stopping to take off his mask. Hey, look audience! It was Tom all along! Even though the guy that looked like Tom is already revealed to be the henchman, here's Tom taking his mask off just in case you're dead from the neck up. Assuming, of course, you didn't know that the swap had taken place within the first five seconds anyway. See also: Oh My God, I cannot possibly guess what she's going to do with that hypodermic spray gun!!!John Woo's direction is the big star of the show (and yes, Tom does get to do a ""jumping sideways in slow motion while firing two guns simultaneously""), the colour of the movie a pleasant autumnal red/brown in contrast to DePalma's original clinical winter shades. In fact, he's the ideal director for this outing, as, while the first had pleasing complexity, this one is a by the book (if not - quite - by the numbers) actioner. The plot is non-existent, a mere 10 minutes' worth of events, to whit: bad-guys-steal-virus. Good-guys-steal-back-virus. The fact that this thin premise is expanded to two hours means everything else is just irrelevant padding and trimmings. Look at the first fifty minutes. Cruise steals a chip that tells him the secret of the deadly virus (Clue: It's deadly!) Yet we knew that before the opening credits, so why do we need to wait for Tom to find out? Like Connery finding out how they stole the nukes in ""Thunderball"", this is a time-filling game of catch-up. And surely his bosses would have known what the virus was capable of anyway? This is expounded by a fat Englishman in a hospital who only exists to give the most blatant display of clunky exposition I've been privileged to witness. Except he comes back to life or something, and I must admit I didn't get that bit, I was distracted - keep the noise down with those sweet wrappers!!!Dougray Scott is good as the Scottish (what, not English?) villain who pronounces Ethan's surname like it's a form of East End rhyming slang. Thandie Newton's appearance in the first half of the film revolves around her breasts, while the second sees her redundant and looking pensive to what sounds like the lovechild of Clannad. Ving Rhames is Ving Rhames; the cool-sounding stereotypical black guy that does all the work while the Caucasian with the impossibly white teeth gets the glory. I half expected his credit to read ""Uncle Tom"", but I was left disappointed.Things to look out for: a blatant steal from Darkman (and I'm not talking about the faces - think cigar cutter time) and an ending which - perhaps geekily - reminded me of the last McCoy Doctor Who story. Except that after the Doctor did a motorbike clash, he didn't end it by beating the crap out of the Master in a martial arts video game that went on and on and on for fifteen minutes. Maybe I'm just not enough of a bloke to appreciate it, but my testosterone is of a controllable level, so that I don't watch karate fights that bore and go ""Wow! That was way way cool!"" I just think - where's the plot?If this were the first film in a franchise then I would be predicting its demise. As it's a continuation from a superior original then I guess it does a reasonable job of treading water and will ensure that Cruise will once again take on board a mission that is, if not impossible, then moderately entertaining.",Mission - Impossible II
103,fernandoschiavi,"As much as this film maintains key aspects of the original series, it is a generic action film, easily constituting the weakest entry in the franchise",6,18 July 2020,"The first Mission: Impossible won over the audience by leaving the comfort zone of most spy films. With a great modern classic of action cinema created, Universal Pictures continues the franchise trying to expand it and elevating its grandeur and several levels. With the proposal to always change the director, letting each one leave his ""author's mark"" in the films of the franchise, the chosen one to lead this sequence is John Woo, Chinese director specialized in action films and until then known by the recent ""The Last"" Threat (1996) ""and mainly,"" The Other Face (1997) ""with John Travolta and Nicolas Cage. Therefore, Woo was the obvious choice of producer and star Tom Cruise, who wanted to launch the franchise headlong into insane and increasingly ""impossible"" action.With the departure of Brian De Palma from the direction, the change in style was already evident in the first minutes, in which the spectator finds himself in an explosive action scene in the middle of the plane to, soon after, see Ethan Hunt, on vacation, practicing climbing in a cliff without any safety equipment. These sequences already gave us the introduction of what we would see ahead: exaggerated and stunning action scenes elevated to the tenth power. The far-fetched and technically-savvy style emerges, highlighting suspense, classic espionage and the game of appearances, and something different, more combative and less ingenious comes in. This is not necessarily totally bad, just a different language, another look at the franchise, something that can complement and enhance what had already been presented to the viewer.One of the reasons the original film took four years for this sequence was certainly the elaboration of the action scenes, all very well shot by John Woo and with his signature: slow motion and circular movements. Tom Cruise recorded most of the film without stuntmen, leaving the director and his entire team very concerned. The scene in which Ethan Hunt, the character played by Cruise, is climbing a cliff, believe it or not, was filmed with the actor himself hanging in the Utah mountains, one of the film sets. The rest of the film was made in Australia, which, incidentally, was very well photographed by Jeffrey L. Kimball, who makes the most of the natural beauty of Australia and its capital, not just the kangaroos, koalas and crocodiles, as it usually happens. Another positive point for the pair formed between Woo and Cruise.The script, now written only by Robert Towne, is one of the weaknesses of this film. The speed with which the events take place leaves the plot a little unlikely. Privileging only the main actor, he leaves the other characters in the background and out of focus. Just see what happens to the Nyah thief. After an automobile chase (one of the positive highlights of the film) that almost ends in death, she throws herself into Ethan's arms and, the very next day, is plotting with him how to enter the enemy's hideout, an ex-boyfriend of hers. Everything like that, easy. Perhaps only James Bond to achieve this with a woman in such a short time. In order to prevent this continuation from facing the same criticisms that surrounded the original film, which had a confusing and full of holes' plot, the script tries to always remain within reach of the viewer's understanding, leading his characters to explain what is happening every ten minutes. The inevitable result is that Mission: Impossible 2 ends up being a little slow in its second act - which is a shame, since the first fifteen minutes and the final forty-five are, to use a more than appropriate cliché, 'pure dynamite'.
John Woo's management, on the other hand, firmly believes in the incredible at the expense of the believable. The filmmaker ties the choreographic impossibilities with the plot in a more coherent way, in this aspect, than in the excellent classic of the 90s. The most impossible is not the mission accomplished by the characters, which, in reality, does not even matter much to involve us during the projection, but the humanly improbable achievements, conductors of a sensuality and an identity that have much correspondence with the quality of the director. Right at the beginning of the film, it already provides a complete inversion of his intuition for the franchise. The icon of the moment is Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and Woo's job is to mystify him incredibly, in a way that makes him not only a symbol of espionage, something shared with the classic James Bond, but also a mirror of the cinema of ""real"" action, with impressive explosions, high-speed chases and a beating to entertain the most insensitive.The sequence that precedes the credits, as in the 007 series, is intense and goes straight to the point without wasting time with unnecessary explanations: we meet the villain, we realize how cruel he is and we are soon led to meet Ethan Hunt, hero of the original film, while he climbs a mountain without the aid of equipment (and without stuntmen, as Cruise made a point of carrying out the risky maneuvers only with the help of a cable - which was erased during post-production, obviously). John Woo is fully aware of the proposal of his action, even of his drama, more loaded with theatricality. We are not talking about schizophrenic sequences, although the quick cuts lead to a vision of the type, but a very dynamic, but controlled conduction. The spectator's amusement, entertained by great moments, such as the hand-to-hand duel between the hero and the villain, already at the climax of the tape, arises from the surgical work of the edition, which does not make us a lost audience, but immersed in a game in the what time is everything.Most of the construction of the plot is based on the sexual interest between Hunt and Nayah (Thandie Newton) is made in the first visual contact between the two characters, interspersed with a dancer's dress, coming and going in slow motion. If that were not enough, the scene in the bathtub is also very good, giving the involvement that the script itself does not.
Some scenes are worth mentioning. The intense car chase in Sevilla between Ethan and Nyan on a road that borders a cliff is played out as a flirtation, a beginning of courtship that will connect the two characters emotionally throughout the narrative. This romantic action adds some layers to the protagonist, who genuinely cares for Nyan - and this more humanized aspect of Ethan would be explored a lot in the following films. We also have the electrifying ""mission impossible"" of the Biocyte Pharmaceuticals invasion that culminates in an electrifying, tense and action-packed scene.
As already mentioned, the lack of rhythm in the plot is notorious. The script chooses to hide its weapons until the final act, when Hunt invades the enemy's headquarters to recover the terrible Chimera virus (whose destructive power seems to have been removed from the epidemic). From there, the action is uninterrupted and we see the director at his best, using all the resources that made him famous: abundant slow motion cameras; radical (and absurd) maneuvers carried out on motorcycles and cars; weapons that seem to take on a life of their own when jumping from side to side; fights full of acrobatics that defy the law of gravity. There is not even a lack of visual signature with the famous pigeons, which transmit charm and elegance to the dark tunnels of the enemy's headquarters and a chilling sequence when one of them flies through the burning door that Ethan just destroyed. We see a chase that passes along the coastal coast, through back roads, through the forest and ends back at the edge of the sea. Motorcycles jumping over the cameras, motorcycles crossing motorcycles, cars exploding and overturning several times; Cruise performing acrobatics, going through the flames with the bike, making it a ski to escape shots, prancing under the front wheel, passing inches from being hit by a car, turning on the axle, taking a hand off the handlebars and shooting at the vehicle - it explodes. The ""heads-up"" between Ethan and Sean in the final chase is a fantastic tribute to the western, one of Woo's great influences. From the insanity of the motorbikes being launched into the air and exploding, to the final fight, in the sand, in a hand-to-hand fight. When the director takes the opportunity to return to the 1970s. To the countless martial arts films he directed in Hong Kong, at the beginning of his career. The fight between Tom Cruise and Dougray Scott is something that the Mission: Impossible franchise would never show again: hand-to-hand combat with a lot of kickboxing and plastic movements. Everything perfectly synchronized with the contagious theme song created by Lalo Schifrin, who this time received a new treatment from Hans Zimmer (it is impossible to leave the cinema without whistling it).If John Woo and Tom Cruise were unable to produce a film that matched the previous one, at least they had a fun, energetic sequence, the most stylized of the entire franchise and of enormous financial success (again). And they established the path that Mission: Impossible would take from then on: a different director for each film, a new approach and a new style. The same universe, always with the same protagonist, but in unique productions, which at the same time that dialogue with those that came before and after, also work in isolation. John Woo fulfills what he proposed with her, conferring yet another unexpected decision on the part of the narrative - still following a very traditional model. Simplicity, however, gets in the way. The viewer expects complex plots. It is observed, therefore, that the intelligence of the first film was abandoned, which requires a less in-depth look from the viewer. As much as it maintains key aspects of the original series, it is a generic action film, easily constituting the weakest entry in the franchise.",Mission - Impossible II

105,TheNorthernMonkee,diabolical MTV farce,1,9 September 2005,"SPOILERS Way back in the 1960s a wonderful television series was released called ""Mission Impossible"". With a legendary theme tune and some great stories, the series was followed by an equally superb film in 1996. Entertaining and well shot, it was only a matter of time before star Tom Cruise would find himself reprising the role of Ethan Hunt. It's a disastrous fact therefore that this sequel is an abomination. More like a badly shot MTV movie, it is badly acted, written and contains some of the worst film fight scenes of all time.After Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) steals a manufactured disease, it is up to fellow secret agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) to retrieve it. Adding Ambrose's former love Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) to the mix, and the film descends into a mediocre action packed love triangle.From the opening scenes of Tom Cruise climbing up a cliff without protective ropes, you can tell that this film is going to be awful. When he begins to fall in love with Thandie Newton's dire Nyah, you're suspicions are confirmed.Finally, let's progress to the ending and look at the absolutely diabolical final fight scene. It's never a good idea to analyse the ending of a film, but on this occasion, the terrible motorbike and hand to hand combat events at the end need to be talked about.The bike scene is awful. Put simply it is a pointless, irrelevant battle which collapses in on itself. Following that, the combat scene between Cruise and Scott is a farce. Set to your typical MTV soundtrack and with ""Mortal Kombat"" style fighting (including the rudimentary slow motion death), the whole scene is a joke with absolute no merit.It feels only fair to try to find a positive side to this film. In that respect the character of Hugh Stamp, played by Richard Roxburgh, is the rare highlight of this awful film. Funny and entertaining, the character is a surprising joy. It's a small positive in an otherwise major mistake.With a feel of an MTV video, ""Mission Impossible II"" is an enormous mistake. Badly written, acted and shot, it is one of the worst films in living memory. Even the brief joy of Richard Roxburgh's Hugh can't save the film from failing badly. A dire movie worth avoiding at all costs.",Mission - Impossible II
106,russem31,A worthy sequel.,7,7 May 2006,"""Mission: Impossible II"" is another great film directed this time by master director John Woo (you see his touches in this film for sure - including his trademark white doves!). Although this film isn't really in the vein of the ""Mission: Impossible"" TV series, probably because most of the main character in the series died in the first film - it's still a great action film. Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt (with long hair this time) as well as Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell. And the action sequences are incredible (as to be expected from John Woo). However, the love interest and villain this time around are okay in my opinion and the score could be better.

107,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Stylish and spectacular... with some unnecessary cheese,8,27 July 2006,"Agent Ethan Hunt is assigned to retrieve a deadly virus and make sure that it doesn't fall into the wrong hands. The main suspect who is attempting to use the virus for deadly purpose is Sean Ambrose, a former agent that once worked with Hunt, who has his own team of agents and mercenaries.With John Woo at the helm, the film is much more based on action than suspense and intrigue of the first. There is a decent espionage story, however it is not very original, but Woo manages to play it all out in a stylish and very entertaining fashion. Featuring more spectacular set pieces and outrageous stunts than the first, which then all culminates in an typically explosive Woo climax. Tom Cruise is good as the cool and calculating Ethan Hunt who, once again, packs plenty of cool. The highlight, though, is Dougray Scott as the villain - it is a simple and shallow role, but Scott plays it out to fit the film's comic book feel damned near perfectly.The down point is the ridiculously cheesy romantic element of the film. Thankfully, it only appears in a few scenes, but one of them (a shootout in a virus lab) is pivotal so that might ask you to stretch your ability to forgive for scenes like that. Ironically though, in that scene things end up like should - a good character commits self-sacrifice to save another good character who can foil the bad guys' plan - but it's how that scene gets there that is so dumb.Though, it shouldn't be that hard to let that slide as it is quickly overshadowed by much more engaging and enjoyable action scenes - including an awesome motorcycle chase - which is what exactly what an action movie like this needs. 8/10Rated PG-13: violence and intense action",Mission - Impossible II

109,EijnarAmadeus,Woo celebrates with birds and action,6,22 June 2003,"M:I-2 - spoilers((( Tom Cruise starred in the thriller classic De Palma's Mission Impossible in 1996 and was a big blockbuster. The sequel didn't start shooting before in 1999 and was released summer 2000, and it was certainly not a bad experience watching the movie in the cinema. The movie has a charming and very smooth color like, very nice filmed and stuff and that makes a twist between hot romance and bloody bad-guys. Cruise stars again as Ethan Hunt but this time the villain is the Irish Dougray Scott and my-lady is Thandie Newton as Nyah Hall. The movie fits very good and has some scenes that really entertains with big E, for an example the motorbike chase between Hunt and Ambrose (Scott), the final climax kung-fu between the same two guys, the shooting scene in the lab, the chopper wiring down Hunt, the flamingo dancing Spanish (beautiful) and last but not least the opening climbing scene. The film futures sometimes highly pro and interesting progress and charisma, but is maybe too much for the goods when it all gets hooked up by the same slow-motion effect all the time. A very peace-and-love scene is when Hunt has just blown up a door and the frame stands in fire, Ambrose looks and you can clearly see the shining from the fire in his eyes, a dove flies upon threw the door and next comes Hunt walking in slow-mo. past the door, flaring in Ambrose's eyes. Good! I don't say M:I-2 is more teenage based then the original, but it is maybe more for the new audience, those who were allowed watching R rated movie in 1997. Cause the film has just as much violence as the first, but is maybe not so difficult to follow.
STORY: Ethan Hunt are still working for IMF (Impossible Mission Forces). He is on a vacation when his boss contacts him and tells him to go to Spania where he can find the elegant thief/spy Nyah. They hooks together because Nyah is a ex-girlfriend to a new terrorist Sean Ambrose who has stolen the virus Chimera and also Belleraphon, who helps you getting rid of Chimera. Hunt starts a hunt! He also gets together with Luther (remember from the first) and Billy Bird. Very entertaining and nice action scenes, but the first is better. STARS: *** 3/5",Mission - Impossible II
110,perfectbond,Unfairly savaged,8,17 November 2003,"First I should say I never saw the TV series. It was before my time. Now, while MI:2 borrows from several films, especially Notorious, Entrapment and Goldeneye, it by no means deserves all the criticism it has received. The action sequences, especially the pre-credit, motorcycle chase, and martial arts finale, were exciting and creatively filmed though Woo's trademark touches are bordering on self-parody. Dougray Scott made for a good nemesis and his henchman was nasty as well. In an age of potential bio-terrorism the plot has some relevance. Post 9/11, I don't think they could've done the pre-credit sequence. On the negative side Hunt has all the heroics to himself and Newton didn't make for the most alluring love interest. Still this franchise is more interesting than Bond though I wonder if it can generate twenty films and/or survive the exit of Cruise. Overall, 7/10. Bring on MI:3!",Mission - Impossible II

To be clear if your looking for some characterisation, intelligence and a plot and good script then this isn't for you, but what it lacks in smartness it makes up for in action. This even today has some of the best action scenes I've ever seen. Cruise is charismatic of course. Unfortunately Anthony Hopkins is completely wasted but Dougray Scott is a decent villain. The film is beautiful as you'd expect from a John Woo vehicle. The main problem is the pacing. Sometimes it goes quite a while without any action and unfortunately theirs nothing particularly interesting happening then and then the film goes non stop breakneck insane for a while but for the sheer fun and incredible action scenes it's still enjoyable brainless fun.",Mission - Impossible II
112,oneloveall,Outstanding mediocrity,5,28 October 2006,"Technical extravaganza, helmed by violence artist John Woo, for better or worse subverts any intention this movie has to be taken seriously in the slightest, and in turn provides some pretty spiffy action entertainment. Offering stark counterpoint to Brian De Palma's more grounded, practical minded, more serious original, Woo seizes the opportunity to bask in this cash cow franchise with some of his most ludicrous, surreal, and fascinating choreography and stuntwork to date, all under the blanket, of course, of the certifiably generic script. Complete with viruses, bitter ex-agents and femme fatals, MI2's weak plot won't matter much once the insanely over-the-top tone soaks in. While detailing some of the particulars leading up to the convoluted action might not be his strong point, Woo definitely manages to make some of the scenes exude far more sensuality then they have any right to be (the help of luscious Thandie Newton does not hurt), and while Cruise's ""bad in black"" shtick might not have stuck, the impressive lensing makes even this look badass.",Mission - Impossible II
113,AhmedSpielberg99,"I was hoping that this would be extremely underrated, but it's not!",5,4 August 2018,"With a heavy-handed dialogue that includes a lot of repeated lines, excessive use of slow motion technique, awkward romantic scenes, cringe-worthy melodramatic moments, tons of clichés, sequences that exist for nothing but manipulating, familiar plot, clumsy resolution, and nonsensical decisions. John Woo's MI II is more like a cheesy 007 movie that hasn't aged well. Even the ""impossible mission"" here lacks the tension the original has. Adding insult to injury, it is followed by a long boring scene that I almost fell asleep during it.On the bright side, the last 20 minutes of the movie feature some of the best over-the-top action sequences I've seen in the this century. I'm not kidding, the action set pieces are staggering that I was about to forget how silly this movie is!
Also, the opening scenes that came before opening titles were kinda promising, and showed some cool technological equipments and devices.
It goes without saying that Tom Cruise is charming as ever specially with this Magnolia long hair.(5/10)",Mission - Impossible II
114,Geeky Randy,Geeky Randy's summary,2,4 August 2015,"John Woo dumbs down this sequel to the 1996 action-spy blockbuster so much that it's almost unwatchable. What was cool back in spring 2000 and became out of style by autumn 2000 is all here: Limp Bizkit's rendition of Lalo Schifrin's theme, Tom Cruise's bad haircut, Thandie Newton as the leading lady, Anthony Hopkins hanging out in Spain, Rade erbedija and his mustache, etc. Yes, this film's predecessor is a bit more complicated than what it needed to be, but it didn't need to be given a lobotomy. Even Ving Rhames' reprisal and the Australian setting can't save this hopeless, dull waste of two hours. The 1960's show's cast responded negatively to the first film, it'd be interesting to hear what they have to say about this one.★½ (out of four)",Mission - Impossible II
115,JohnRayPeterson,Outrageous action. Pulse pounding moments.,7,6 April 2012,"I've just finished a ""Mission Impossible"" marathon and to my dismay, can't figure why this sequel rated so poorly. If all those who voted over the years had an opportunity (or the patience or the time) to watch all four episodes back to back, I think this rating thing would fare differently.Is there anyone who can honestly say the scene 2 of this movie, where Tom Cruise is free solo climbing in The Grand Canyon, jumping from one escarpment to another, slipping to an almost certain death and hanging from one hand like even Alex Honnold would not dare to try (Google that guy), is not an absolutely stunning piece of action footage. For good measure, the music playing in the background of that scene, the song 'Iko Iko', was, for those who know the story or origin of the song, a brilliant choice. The cinematography in that movie was superior to the original movie, in my not all that humble opinion, and certainly as good as the following two sequels. Critics, including music critics, all agree the OST (original sound track) in M I-2 is the best; I could not reproduce, at home, the sound I heard at the cinema, at least not without my neighbors getting very upset. I remember, twelve years after the fact, the excitement I felt walking out of the cinema; the others were also exciting, just not quite as much for me. The franchise does so well because many other 'moviegoers' walk out of the cinema with that very same excitement.I must acknowledge that, as with all big Hollywood action features, the story as well as the stunts defy reality and it's mostly fantasy, so the 'M.I.' films are aimed at thrill seekers and who isn't one from time to time. Anyone trying to judge these movies, comparing them to classics or award winning novel based dramas, is farting downwind.The first three 'M.I.' had renowned directors, but John Woo was unquestionably the best at action sequences, which abound in M I-2. The motorcycle chase scene is one hell of a superbly choreographed and edited action scene. Dougray Scott is the best villain of all the four M.I.; argue that one if you can. The best female co-star of all four 'M.I.', for my liking, is Thandie Newton. I know I am completely counter majority opinion here, but I maintain that back to back viewing of the four movies, or viewing in the same year would generate far different results.",Mission - Impossible II
116,Christian_Dimartino,"Don't get why some didn't like it, but I thought it was fun.",8,24 July 2010,"Tom Cruise reprises his role as Ethan Hunt in M:I 2. I will be honest. I have never seen the original Mission impossible film. But luckily, with a sequel like Mission impossible 2, you haven't been missing anything. You don't feel lost. you feel engrossed. Though some of Mission impossible 2's story plot is kind of silly, it's still dynamite entertainment and explosive fun.Mission impossible 2 involves an ex IMF agent named Sean(played by Dougray Scott) who is going to unleash terror on the world by spreading a virus, and it's up to Ethan Hunt(Cruise obviously) to stop him. with the help of his team, and his love interest Nyah(played by Thandie Newton), who is an ex of Sean's.The whole thing with the virus may sound a little silly. But don't put that as a flaw in your opinion. M I 2 has some cool action sequences, including the climactic chase scene on the motorcycles. Of the two Mission impossible films that i've seen, MI2 is certainly better. Not that MI3 was bad or anything.MI2 is a lot of fun. Tom Cruise is a likable action star and a good actor. Actually, a great one. I know this movie was big ten years ago but he is. I had never appreciated his acting until I saw ""Magnolia""(one of my three favorite films). I never knew how funny he could be until I saw him in Tropic thunder. And I never knew how lovable he is until I saw him in Knight and day. Since Knight and day, i've been on a Cruise/Diaz marathon.I still don't get why everyone hated Vanilla sky. But anyways, back to MI2. MI2 is a lot of fun. It's very entertaining, action packed, cool, and a lot of fun. I know it's weird to be reviewing this now, but since i'm on the Cruise/Diaz theme, I thought what the hell. Mission impossible is what got Cruise his title as an action star. And even today he still has it.",Mission - Impossible II
117,Movie-12,"Involving and exciting, very different from the original film. *** out of ****.",7,9 June 2000,"MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2 / (2000) ***""Mission: Impossible 2"" has as much in common with the original movie as hot has with cold. Beyond some of the starring roles, the two productions are as different as day and night. Brian DePalma directed ""Mission: Impossible,"" a puzzling, disjointed action picture leaving little to no hope for a sequel. However, the action-orientated John Woo has taken the position in place of DePalma and captures the excitement, venture, and stylish sequences with more dexterity and structure. ""Mission: Impossible 2"" is relative, involving, and swank. The film takes all too familiar ""James Bond"" components and creates a movie more similar to the licensed to kill spy than the primary contents of the television series.Tom Cruise once again stars as proselyte I.M.F. agent Ethan Hunt, recently assigned to track down a former representative who possesses a deadly biochemical substance obtained by the murdered scientist Dr. Vladimir Nekhorick (Rade Sherbedgia). The villain, Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), once had an attractive girlfriend named Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton), whose occupation as a professional thief makes Ethan dissatisfied when he must recruit her as a member of a mission team.After sleeping and falling in love with her, Ethan oppose the idea of sending Nyah back to Ambrose's luxurious resort to recover information of his criminal intentions. Equipped with a traceable implant, this young woman, Ethan, and his two accomplices Luther (Ving Rhymes), and Billy (John Polson), seek to discover and foil the plans of Ambrose and his accomplices.The story is clear, involving, and comprehendible; it is not so complex the audience becomes lost and attentions wander. The plot contains enough tension, high stakes, twists, and intriguing characters to keep us on edge.""Mission: Impossible 2"" is not all story, however, much of the production has a condescending commercial appearance. The sophisticated actors, rock and roll music, intense action sequences, high tech car chase scenes, stylish camera angles, and audience pleasing one liners are more self gratifying rather than entertaining. I can almost see the producers now, discussing what battles scenes and explosions to deposit within the film's theatrical trailer; the filmmakers also need to know that external action itself does not make for a thought-provoking movie.The production succeeds mainly due to an effective, solidly portrayed villain, keenly acted by Dougray Scott (""Ever After: A Cinderella Story""). He conquers his role with a sense of sly, fiendish wit and knowledge. Tom Cruise again proves he is more than capable of dramatizing Ethan Hunt with style and enticing persuasion. Supporting roles by Thandie Newton, Ving Rhames, Brendan Gleeson, and Anthony Hopkins are also impressive.""Mission: Impossible 2"" accomplishes that exceptional task of actually being better than its preceding original. The success of this picture is surely due to the direction by John Woo (""Face/Off""), who is one of the better action directors currently in work. His formulaic attitude presents itself in the end, however, as the movie turns from sharp and sneaky to running on sheer adrenaline through the final half hour. It really irritates me when the third act of a movie consists of loud gun shoot-outs, risky stunts, and physical combat in which men dressed in black suits fire seemingly endless rounds at the protagonist only to miss, yet he pulls out a small caliber pistol and shoots every one of them dead. ""Mission: Impossible 2"" may work as an action picture, but it is not at the level of resisting the temptations to throw intellect into the wind and conclude itself in auto pilot mode.",Mission - Impossible II
118,anselmdaniel,Action centric at the expense of originality,6,6 November 2020,"This review contains spoilers.Mission: Impossible 2 is the sequel to 1996's Mission: Impossible. The movie is directed by John Woo and stars Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt. Returning in the sequel is Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell. Ethan Hunt must track down a dangerous human-designed virus called Chimera. A rogue Impossible Missions Force agent has already captured the virus and Ethan Hunt must stop him and retrieve the virus.Some of the good aspects of this movie are its action and Tom Cruise's performances. The action here is fun to watch. John Woo does a good job setting up and directing the action set pieces. Like John Woo's previous movies the movie has wild action with Ethan Hunt being a super action star. Ethan Hunt is able to do impossible stunts that make the first movie's stunts looks childish. Likewise, Tom Cruise keeps up his end of the bargain and is able to fulfill the action role well.John Woo's direction leaves a lot to be desired. John Woo directs this movie like he would direct his other action movies. The movie that comes to mind is John Woo's Hard Boiled. Mission: Impossible 2 felt like Hard Boiled. For viewers that liked John Woo's movies this is a plus and not a negative. For others expecting more of the original's charm will not feel it here. The movie only utilizes the characters and setting.The plot of this movie is incredibly inconsistent. Nothing about this movie's writing is good. Despite having a lengthy time to write the story, it is not well written. There are loads of plot, holes and inconsistencies. This part is almost impossible to ignore.Overall, I would not recommend Mission: Impossible 2.Grade: C",Mission - Impossible II
119,msbreviews,Rating: D+,3,30 July 2018,"Mission: Impossible - Fallout is coming out next week, so naturally I decided to watch and review every single movie of the franchise. I already wrote my thoughts on Mission: Impossible (1996) and now it is time for the second installment of the saga ... Where we, unfortunately, reach the bottom (better sooner than later).Even though the action stunts are still mostly realistic and very well filmed, they reach a point where I can't buy into them anymore. From two guys colliding mid-air after jumping from their bikes at high speed to explosions spread throughout the entire runtime, this film is pretty bad. 60 minutes into it and there isn't a single action sequence. The suspense and tension, which are a stamp of the first movie, are nowhere near the levels that they used to be, and the slow-motion is excessively employed.The story incorporates a love triangle between Ethan Hunt, Sean Ambrose, and Nyah that feels so strangely awkward and unnecessary. There is an evident James Bond vibe to this film, and that is precisely what wrecked it. This is Mission: Impossible and John Woo almost ruined the whole saga. Tom Cruise's character is an entirely different agent. He transforms himself into this sort of playboy kind of guy who has nothing to do with the Hunt that I know from M:I-1. The whole story hinges on the audience's feelings about his relationship with Nyah, but I can't care enough about Thandie Newton's character because she simply has no depth!Ving Rhames was by far the best secondary character in the first movie. In this one, Luther is just a computer nerd and his funny personality is gone. Dougray Scott plays a boring villain with generic motivations, and everyone else doesn't really matter. There is a severe lack of character development. Nevertheless, the saving grace of M:I-2 is definitely its cast. Newton is very charming as Nyah, Scott makes his awful script more believable and Cruise is ... Well, Tom Cruise.He continues to do all his stunts, and there are some ""money shots"" that he performs exceptionally well. To be honest, this film has some beautiful cinematography and a magnificent Hans Zimmer's score. Even when the action takes itself too seriously, these aspects at least make it bearable. John Woo does a lot of things the wrong way, but he adds some subtle details to his shots that become important to the plot later on.However, this is about it. There are so many cons to overwhelm the pros. The editing is all over the place. The pacing is no longer frenetic as it was in the previous movie. Like I wrote above, I have to wait more than one hour to enjoy some freaking action. The first half of the film is slow and tedious, while the second half starts to accelerate to finish in style. The ending has so much action that most of it becomes stupid. I mean, really stupid. Some moments are supposed to be taken seriously, but it is a tough task not to laugh at the hilarious set pieces.How can a sequel to such a fantastic action movie be so bad? Well, M:I-2 is the undeniable proof. There are so many things gone wrong with this one. John Woo transformed a confusing yet mysterious plot from the first installment into a hilariously awful screenplay. The plot is quite predictable, the story is emotionally weightless, and even the action goes to levels of dumbness that I've only witnessed in the worst possible films. A great cast and some nice technical details help counterweigh the cons, but Tom Cruise's lead saves the day.",Mission - Impossible II
120,alice liddell,Canny Woo.,7,27 July 2000,"What could have been another tiresome superhero-foils-the-villains film becomes subversive deconstruction in the hands of John Woo.  By shooting in an audacious, fragmentary, ironic style; by alluding to a number of directors - Leone, Melville, Kubrick etc. - whose metier has been to undermine the ideal of the conventional action hero; by once again (after FACE/OFF) invoking Franju, inserting his famous white birds signifying madness at the precise moment  when Ethan 'Colin' Hunt is preparing to save the day; by associating the central triangle with earth, wind and fire, and leaving out water (Robert Towne, remember?), without which we would all die, Woo undermines the film's retrogressive assumptions, giving us a seriously compromised hero.  The colours are to die for.  Genius.",Mission - Impossible II
121,FlickJunkie-2,Impossible to believe,6,22 November 2000,"The purpose of this silly action adventure flick seems to have been to live up to its name.  The malarkey they want us to swallow is so utterly impossible that this film could easily be one of the most laughable movies of 2000.  Fifty bad guys shoot 10,000 bullets at Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) with automatic weapons, but never even wing him.  Hunt, armed only with pistols, kills a bad guy with every bullet he fires, often killing them three at a time while somersaulting through the air.John Woo (Broken Arrow, Face/Off) is a veteran of action adventure films and his expertise in this area is evident throughout the film.  It contains stupendous action sequences throughout, though I thought Woo's attempt to turn Tom Cruise into Jackie Chan was a bit much.  Woo also chose some breathtaking locations and the photography was first rate.Ronald Moore's (Star Trek: Generations) story was an utterly unoriginal excuse to keep half of Hollywood's stunt actors employed.  The dialogue was wretched.  If one more character ripped off his face, I would have stomped the DVD.The acting was nothing special.  Cruise really had nothing intelligent to say or do, so the best I can say about him is that he was in great shape and showed us what a good athlete he is.  Thandie Newton (Beloved) was initially very dynamic and sassy, but by the end of the film, she was reduced to a quivering jellyfish.  Dougray Scott was fair as the villain, but lacked the wickedness to make him truly hateful. This film did well at the box office grossing over $200 Million, a testimonial to the American public's inherent need to see stuff blown up without the burden of having to lug their brains to the movie theater.  I rated this film a 6/10 on the strength of Woo's fabulous action sequences. Wear earplugs (to protect your ears from the loud explosions and the insipid dialogue) and don't expect to be mentally stimulated.",Mission - Impossible II

The Face Off theme is back, and this just became ridiculous as people began tearing off their faces seemingly endlessly to reveal that they were someone else.I was just about waiting for Elvis to show up!The fight scenes were very Oriental with silly mid air kicking things all over the place, and as for the motorcycles that ""happened"" to being driven around the island that Tom stole one from, that was the most obvious prop setup I've seen.

123,mahmus,A dent in an otherwise consistently great franchise,5,15 September 2020,"This movie is a lot of fun, but also a lot of stupid.I love John Woo and I love how silly his Hollywood films are, but he was not the right choice for a Mission: Impossible movie. He might bring some badass, over-the-top action, but he also brings a style that's more distracting than anything, and completely changes the characters of Ethan Hunt.Hunt has never been a particularly complex protagonist (most times serving as a vessel for the audience to experience the action), but I've always loved the character. He's kind of a goof, he's good at his job and he's fun to watch. He's not is this edgy, too-cool-for-school action hero that gets laid on the job. I wanted to punch this Ethan in the face.Also, the villain is way too hammy and only loses because he takes an eternity to pull the trigger on Hunt. I do think that his plan however has aged very well considering the current global situation.It does one thing better than the first one though: it rarely gets boring. As much as I enjoy the original, it could get very dull very fast. Here, it never stops. There are boring scenes, sure, but they're rare. The infiltration on the villain's base was really cool.I had fun with this movie, but that doesn't mean I think it's good. Thankfully, the series would only get better and better after this. It's a fun action movie, a passable John Woo film and a pretty weak entry in an otherwise consistently awesome franchise.Also, who the hell's idea was it to put Limp Bizkit on the soundtrack?!",Mission - Impossible II

Hunt and his team (including the lovely Thandie Newton and returning hacker Ving Rhames) must stop the madman (Dougray Scott) before he looses the bug and knocks off Australia.Action-master John Woo (The Killer, Hard Boiled) takes over the reigns in this even more action-paced and outlandish sequel to the 1996 hit. Woo brings his bullet ballet style to the franchise with some spectacular action setpieces and stunts. It's interesting to see Anthony Hopkins and Tom Cruise in their few scenes together (Hopkins glorified cameo seems almost like Hannibal eyeing a snack sometimes) but I think Newton gives the best performance of the film, Cruise seems to move in two modes: determined and cocky.

125,Rickting,Noisy nonsense which isn't enough fun,4,30 December 2014,"I love action movies, but I need a plot to enjoy them properly. Mission Impossible II has little plot. It's something to do with Tom Cruise's superspy trying to destroy an engineered virus. Aside from a romance sub plot there's little other plot. Mission Impossible was a boring spy thriller with a convoluted plot, but the sequel is even worse. Watching MI2 was a very detached experience. There's nothing to invest yourself in or latch onto in this movie. It's just loads of action set pieces with no plot or characters. Tom Cruise is incredibly boring and his character can do anything, so therefore isn't interesting at all. The action itself peaks early on with an impressive rock climbing sequence. From then on, the set pieces are highly artificial and often don't make any sense. Dramatically listless, blank and devoid of a human touch, MI2 is a film watching experience that has absolutely no impact whatsoever and hits about as hard as a soft feather pillow to the face.The film is admittedly well made and it's certainly not unwatchable, but it's difficult to pay attention to it. John Woo remains an accomplished and skilled director of action, but the action in this movie doesn't always suit him. He's better at shootouts and the car chases feel fairly ordinary. The film is trying its best and its target audience will mostly love it. The film requires a certain mood to be able to appreciate it, and cynical viewers may just switch it off out of boredom. A well made action film with plenty of visual splendour, but it comes up short on the screen writing front. Mission Impossible 4 was a good action film but that was because it actually had a plot and there were stakes. At least you could understand what was going on. Here, it's just noisy incoherence. The first MI movie failed because it spent too much time on boring dialogue and not enough action. Here, there's plenty of action but it doesn't deliver. It's difficult to get action films right when the lead is a zombie with muscles. I'm not too hyped about Mission Impossible 5.4/10",Mission - Impossible II

The chemical is known as Chimara where once the person is injected with the substance, it'll only be a matter of time before the body rots and infect half an entire population.Hunt is on the lookout for Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton), one hot babe who used to date Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) in which he wants her on his team along with using Nyah to sneak whatever information Sean has about the chemicals and report.

127,action-6,John Woo has delivered the goods!,10,13 July 2000,"John Woo has done it again!  He has created a massive action thriller that guaranteed will become this summer`s biggest blockbuster, and probably one of the best movies of 2000. The movie stars, just as the original, agent Ethan Hunt.  Hardly a single shot was fired in the original movie, but all that has changed since this movie is directed by my favorite director, John Woo.  John Woo is the master of the action movie and can create stylish action scenes in a way that American action directors only can dream about. The last half of the movie shows you action scenes that will have you weeping with joy.  The action scenes in this movie are so cool! I can`t see why this movie was rated PG-13 in America, because the amount of violence means that it should`ve been given the R-rating(but then the little kids wouldn`t get to see this) Some people out there seem to think that John Woo has just copied the amazing action scenes of ""The Matrix"".  This is completely wrong. These people don`t understand that the action scenes of ""The Matrix"" weren`t original, because the directors ""borrowed"" heavily from John Woo movies like ""Hard Boiled"", ""The Killer"" and ""Face/Off"".  The actionscenes in MI-2 are pure John Woo.The actors are great.  I never really liked Tom Cruise much, but he is good in this movie.  I really liked that Tom Cruise did all his stunts on his own, because John Woo`s previous Hollywood-blockbuster ""Face/Off"" suffered from the fact that it was many times very easy to see that the spectacular scenes were done by stunt-men.  John Woo hasn`t tried to disguise the fact that this movie is pure entertainment and nothing else, but it is nice to see that the spy-element is also present.

John Woo) When a supply of a genetically created disease called 'Chimera' is discovered, IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is sent to destroy the remaining batch, and stop madman Sean Ambrose (Scott) before he kills millions of innocent lives around the world.Dumbed down sequel improves on the original, and includes a brilliant high paced finale and a well used slow motion technique, but the pace is still slow and lacks in action.You are infected with Chimera, my friend. - Dr. Nekhorvich (Rade Serbedzija)",Mission - Impossible II
131,CinematicInceptions,Very different from the original with much more action and a try at a story.,7,10 September 2015,"This is a classic example of how sequels are often very disappointing compared to the original. That's not to say that everyone will see this as a let down after MI1, but there is an incredibly different feel from the '96 installment to the '00 one. The first movie had some action, but was primarily concerned with its plot. Granted, that plot was fairly action driven, but not so much as in MI2. The first movie had an aesthetic similar to The Hunt for Red October, while here we had more of a James Bond aesthetic.The primary reason for this is the change in our protagonist, Ethan Hunt. Whereas the first film set him up as more of a Spielberg kind of hero where the situation has more control over him than he does over it, here Ethan makes active decisions and is treated more as a character. Now, on the surface that sounds like a good thing, but it entails him becoming a action hero that acts as a one man show. He has an internal conflict in his relationship with Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton), which could easily come off as underdeveloped and overblown. Nyah, a former thief, is brought in to help the IMF stop Sean Ambrose. She has some personality but if far from award-winning on the whole. Sean Ambrose is a slightly clichéd villain, and is similar to Sean Bean's role as 006 in Golden Eye since Ambrose is a former IMF agent that often used Hunt as an alter-ego. This helps make some sense of the whole mask aspect of the MI films since some people's faces are incompatible. Luther is back, but something went wrong with his character this time around. I can't quite put my finger on it, but there was something about how he was played or scripted or something that was inconsistent with the Luther from the other installments. There are a couple of other minor characters like the biocyte big wig, Dr. Nekhorvich (who is also an antagonist of sorts), Ambrose's head crony, and the IMF superior. You can tell the filmmakers tried to make the characters prominent and somewhat deep, but it didn't come out all that well.The plot revolves around a synthetic virus called Chimera (the villain) and the antidote Bellerophon (the hero). Ambrose and Ethan's IMF team race to gain control of the deadly virus, and eventually Nyah injects herself with it so that Ambrose can't acquire it. Ambrose wants to spread the virus to a bunch of people so that he or whoever he's working for can sell the antidote, thus creating a hero through the creation of a villain. Like the characters, the plot attempted at depth, maybe trying to say that pharmaceutical companies are trying to play us, but ended up being action driven.John Woo made this a very visually vibrant film with a lot of slow motion, often in unnecessary settings, and exotic settings like the Outback and the Spanish festival, plus that inexplicable dove that makes the beginning of the climatic scene feel like it came out of a Lego video game. Hans Zimmer's score was also exotic, and it sounded pretty good with the opera, but it's not one of his best works. The action is shot to look cool and it does, but at a cost: Ethan Hunt's invincibility mode is turned up to overdrive. The invincibility of it is not overblown like 2012 or Die Hard, but Ethan survives every battle where the odds are against him and has superior skills that we haven't seen before. The climax involves a sunglass-donning Hunt making a grand escape on a motorcycle and having a bunch of people not hit him with machine guns until he shoots them in one go with a handgun. This goes back to the new Ethan Hunt we see in this second installment, though he basically duplicates his air vent drop from the first movie. After that he proceeds to execute a bunch of motorcycle stunts. The closing fight with Ambrose was done pretty well and the slow-mo there felt called for.If I haven't already stressed this enough, you will be surprised if you expect this to be similar to MI1. It's good to watch if your just looking for action. You have to pay some attention to follow the plot, but it's pretty easy to grasp overall. It may very well come off as a Bond rip-off, but 3 and 4 aren't like that in case you were wondering (rogue nation seems to follow suit in this matter, but I haven't seen it yet). I guess it's a good pick for Tom Cruise fans, but take that lightly please. So watch it for fun and with relatively low expectations to start. Overall Rating: 7.2/10.",Mission - Impossible II
132,jhaggardjr,Much better than the first,9,30 May 2000,"I was not a big fan of the first ""Mission: Impossible"" movie from 1996. Even though it had its share of good action and special effects sequences, the movie was bogged down by a confusing plot. Also, it dragged slowly at times. However, you won't see that in ""Mission: Impossible II"", which is a vast improvement over part 1. Thank goodness. Just about everything in ""MI2"" is better than in ""MI1"". The action. The special effects. The locations. Tom Cruise is also much better here than he was in the first film. And it has better supporting characters this time out. Director John Woo is obviously a far better director at directing action movies than ""MI1's"" Brian De Palma. ""MI2"" is much faster paced, exciting, and exhilirating. This will be a blockbuster. I hope it outgrosses the first film.***1/2 (out of four)",Mission - Impossible II
133,pilot1009,Ridiculous and not fun,2,17 September 2020,I all ok with a shoot'em type film now and again but as with most films you want a plot and some realism - unless it is a pure cartoon fantasy - this is just CGI / action and nothing else no real story or engagement. Actually quite boring.,Mission - Impossible II
134,iohefy-2,fast paced two hours,7,1 June 2000,This was a movie with star power in having Tom Cruise.  I saw the original MI and thought this one was far superior.  I did get tired of the multi-faced actors in the movie.  Plenty of action and blow em ups.  I still liked the old TV series which were not as spectacular but were extremely enjoyable.  Go see it you will enjoy.,Mission - Impossible II
135,Al_The_Strange,"""We just rolled up a snowball and tossed it into hell.""",6,2 August 2015,"Ethan Hunt returns for another mission. This time it's far more extreme and far more impossible. Riding the wave of insane action movies of the 2000s - utterly ridiculous films like Charlie's Angels, Die Another Day, xXx, and more - MI:2 is an adrenaline shot full of flash and style.Unlike the first film, which was more interested in being a spy thriller, MI:2 comes off as a pretty silly and trashy action flick. Much of the story revolves around a biochemical weapon, so the film takes some time to set up the characters with some deception and counter-deception games. When the last hour hits, it becomes an all-out bombardment of over-the-top setpieces, featuring lots of explosive gunplay, dramatic fistfights, and vehicular carnage. There are some bizarre motorcycle stunts, including a scene where Ethan pops a wheelie on the front tire; I'm pretty sure a lot of this defies the laws of physics. A lot of these scenes are ordained with dramatic slow-motion flames...and doves! Lots of freaking doves everywhere for no apparent reason! What do they mean?! The experience of this film is a weird one; the action can be pretty enthralling in its own right, but the build-up to it drags at times, and then when it all goes into overdrive, it's almost overbearing. A lot of scenes require a huge suspension of disbelief. Above all though, the film feels like it follows in the footsteps of so many other action films before it, such as The Rock, GoldenEye, and John Woo's own films like Hard Boiled and Broken Arrow. In the end, it feels like a tiresome ""all style no substance"" show.A lot of this is because the whole plot around the Chimera virus doesn't really break new ground, and combined with the ridiculous action and style, the film feels shallow and senseless. There are a few redeeming qualities, however. Inspired by Hitchcock's Notorious, MI:2 does handle its characters well enough; the romance between Ethan and Nyah is pretty nice, the villain is a good bad guy we can love to hate, and their interactions overall gives the plot enough weight to make it work.This film is made with some very flashy photography and editing; there are a few transitions I find gaudy, but most of the film is pretty stylish and good-looking. Tom Cruise still does his usual schtick, but it is pretty fun to watch Thandie Newton, Ving Rhames, and Dougray Scott in their roles. Brendan Gleeson and Anthony Hopkins are respectable in their small roles. Didn't care much for John Polson. Writing is not particularly great, but some of the lines are pretty amusing. This production uses some very exotic locales, sets, props, costumes, and special effects. I love Hans Zimmer's music score for this - a pretty wild blend of operatic and metal cues - and the film does use a few excellent heavy metal songs (for better or for worse).This is a pretty odd film for the series; it's not much of a Mission: Impossible film, but it is pretty entertaining as a mindless action flick, and it does represent the height of John Woo's stylistic excesses. Genre and franchise fans should give it a try once.3/5 (Experience: Mixed | Story: Okay | Film: Pretty Good)",Mission - Impossible II
136,Offworld_Colony,Cheap and nasty rock and roll entry into the franchise.,3,12 February 2020,"It's loud and ugly, stupid, sexist, awkward and plotholed to buggery. But Tom Cruise has long hair and I kinda dig it. And his free soloing at the start is pretty rad.
I suppose each Mission film for better and worse is a product of its time, and none more-so than M:I:2. Remember when Dougray Scott was tipped to be as big as Hugh Jackman is now? Unfortunately here his Bond villain hammyness is rote and unappealing.
Did I love this film as a kid? Absolutely. I was a fan of Woo's work in Hard Boiled and Face/Off. I enjoyed this film's pseudo-Bond stylings and it's ludicrous bonkers en vogue virus plot. But it's so painfully dated in literally every way now that's it's only enjoyable in a nostalgic way.
The film is cheesy and nobody does cheesy with as much dedication as Cruise and I do like Anthony Hopkins' slimy IMF contact and the mask bait and switch at the end is particularly sadistic, despite making no sense.
But I suppose the best I can say about this film is that it has such a unique and cocksure voice in Woo that it stands alone and is enjoyable because it's awful.
Impossible Mission: Dropping into the vents of the Biocyte building is a rushed, slipshod shadow of the first film's mission. It's clearly comped in places and pretty slack and undramatic.",Mission - Impossible II

Awful, sad, clueless, idiotic. Fortunately we have John Woo giving us a couple or so exciting minutes of adrenaline rush, but that's a tiny percentage of the film's length.",Mission - Impossible II
138,chrisbrown6453,"Mission: Impossible 2, directed by John Woo (Face/Off) explores the action genre by exploiting the stylization of violence.",8,25 October 2001,"Characterized by a hyper realistic aesthetic, Mission: Impossible 2 displays carefully choreographed chase scenes and sophisticated acrobatics à-la-Matrix (often shot in slow-motion ((ugh!)), although not by freezing and rotating the image), between villain and hero.In Mission: Impossible 2 (or M:I2), the lead spy is Ethan Hunt played once again by Tom Cruise, thank god they didn't do the whole James Bond thing by having someone new play him, and his team includes the beautiful thief Nyah (Thandie Newton) and the computer systems expert Luther (Ving Rhames). The mission involves capturing ""Chimera"", a deadly virus engineered by a Russian scientist in search for the cure for influenza. However, in transit to the U.S., the priceless Chimera falls into the wrong hands and Ethan and his team must stop the villainous Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) from exploiting the dangerous chemical weapon. In spite of the film's introductory sequence (where the chosen spy listens to the recognizable recording of the mission's description that ""will self-destruct in 5 seconds""), Woo's Mission: Impossible 2 distances itself significantly from the trademark characteristics which made the television show quite unique. Rather, M:I2 seems to be defined by the director's fascination with the notion of the interchangeability of the face/mask/identity, as more successfully explored in his earlier film Face/Off.  In M:I2, Tom Cruise's character is portrayed as superhuman, and his ways of resolving conflict and surviving death-threatening situations depend more on his superhuman physical strength and ability than on genius or wit. This choice reflects an emphasis on the mechanics of action (enhanced by stunt work and special effects) over the intellectual and emotional conflict and suspense that ensue from good, dramatic writing.All in all, Mission: Impossible 2 suffers from the imbalance produced by excessive action and little drama, and by the predictability of a plot that exists merely to exhibit the magnificence of its hero.  Not even close to the spectacularness ( I know, that's not a word!) of the  1995 original.",Mission - Impossible II
139,bat-5,Intrigue and action combined,8,26 May 2000,"Mission: Impossible 2 delivers on all fronts.  It has exotic locales, a beautiful woman, a really nasty villain, good butt kicking action and Tom Cruise gliding effortlessly through it all.  The plot centers around a disease called Chimera, something really nasty that many would pay dearly to get their hands on it.  With a neat opening sequence, the plot is off and running.  From there, we catch up with Ethan Hunt, dangling off of a cliff.  He gets his orders and we're off on a thrill ride that only John Woo can deliver.  The first part of the movie gives us espionage, treachery, suspense and a taste of what's to come in the second half.  Woo gives us his trademark action sequences where laws of physics take a back seat to his dazzling displays of bullets and bodies flying through space, and there are many scenes of this caliber that are just too visual to describe.  There are enough explosions, car crashes and fights to satisfy any fan of a good action film.  Your mission, seek out M:I-2 and see Woo and Cruise work their magic.",Mission - Impossible II
140,Flagrant-Baronessa,Film: not that impossible!,6,25 July 2006,"Wow, that was lame -- even for me. I'm so sorry.John Woo bravely takes on this second installment of the Mission Impossible trilogy and the end product is a fast-paced, mildly entertaining but completely decent action thriller. It hardly outshines Mission Impossible I, nor does it even fully do it justice -- but it is a solid film that welcomes Tom Cruise back as spy Ethan Hunt on another near-impossible mission for his..uh, agency (?). This time he is to retrieve and destroy a supply of a genetically engineered disease called ""Chimera"", and using his newfound sweetie (Thandie Newton) as bait, his quest is shadowed by personal concerns. OK, so Mission Impossible II is -- like its title -- a tad predictable and seems to want to make up for its lack of clever twists by introducing specialized masks that the characters wear and whenever it gets too predictable, they simply pull off this mask to reveal A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT identity! This borders on silly and desperate as the film progresses, but damn, it's still quality. After all, it is full of gems like Ethan effortlessly picking up a 600 pound motorcycle with one arm, and Ethan swinging his entire body weight from one cliff to the other, again using only one arm!Dougray Scott is a superbly sexy villain but Thandie Newton (of the horrorshow ""Crash"") simply does not deliver, but rather relies on a cute face and a demure smile. It appears that John Woo has picked up on Newton's non-talent in this role and desperately tries to compensate for it with a big, overblown, wailing, ethnic score in the background whenever she attempts a dramatic performance. Embarrassing.Other than this, seriously people, what's the big deal? Or is this simply a combination of 'betrayed' fans of the first film and Tom Cruise-haters giving all of his films a ""1""? It deserves more than a 5/10 rating on IMDb because it truly is very entertaining as an action film, balancing depth and violence in a way that, I thought, could not be done better with its script.6/10",Mission - Impossible II

142,willcundallreview,Disappointing stuff from this franchise's second outing,4,30 August 2015,"If Tom Cruise can really climb freestyle up a rock face and live to tell the tale, then I want to know how he does that and about twenty other crazy features this movie has to offer. Yes Mission: Impossible is back for a second round and features ridiculous stunts, a kind of storyline more suited to James Bond in the 60's and Tom Cruise going absolutely crazy with the fighting. I didn't like this film and although far from hating it, the movie didn't give me much reason to like it at all, with silly things added in here and there as well, well let's go over it shall we.First off you have the stunts, done well and the only thing I will fully remember from this movie but also that this has long droughts without any action and then suddenly has too much. Tom Cruise comes back in the same style he has in the first instalment boasting some over the top fight sequences and also longer hair. The story is for me in certain scenes a little too convoluted, now the entire story as a whole isn't but parts are, they defy logic at certain times and some moments are not well explained and really try too hard to draw you in to a plot I just couldn't invest in.Now what to say about good old John Woo, well to put it in simple terms I really did not enjoy his directing. His style is so insane it just makes normal scenes turn into a crazed stand off and then don't even get me started on the pacing. I can't really say he directs the actors well either and although the cast are fine and all that, his direction can make some scenes just a little dumb and yet again confusing and repetitive. Robert Towne is a legend of screen writing but my word does it look like he has lost it here, I'm not saying this is a career ruin for him not by a long shot but Towne could have done so much better and written something memorable, not just some generic stuff. Staying behind the camera well on the camera maybe is the cinematography which is done well, I liked the nice sweeping shots and angles which change the scene completely, wasn't too sure on the close ups of the face but in general some good stuff. I think if you're going to make a spy film at least put the action in and spread it out, here it is all concentrated in the same place and so it becomes boring after a while, even with the insane stunts. I think we should have seen more of the suspense that at times the first movie brought to the table, too often in this Cruise or should I say Ethan Hunt just does things at a fast pace with no thrill to it. A better villain as well for me would have been better, sure Dougray Scott and his henchmen could be bad but that true terror I did not see, a poor casting choice all round and should have been easier to absolutely hate. This film isn't all bad I admit it has it's moments of genius actually and although I think Cruise is not great in this or the first Mission: Impossible, I can't deny he has a lot of spy style. If you liked the first movie then you should have no problems liking this one too, the stunts and the action are enough I felt to satisfy MI fans. For anyone else please be directed to take your brain out before viewing this, it is popcorn movie stuff and I don't think the plot is smart. So overall I do feel this is poor and not really an addition I think Cruise deserves to have in his film catalogue, he is not good here, not bad but not good and I think spy films do not gain anything extra from having this among their ranks.",Mission - Impossible II

146,p-jonsson,Classical John Woo over the top action feast. Not a good Mission Impossible Movie.,5,1 January 2016,"This is a decent enough mindless action movie with a lot of over the top action but it is not really a Mission Impossible movie. The movie starts of reasonably well being somewhat intelligent with a bit of Mission Impossible feel to it. It is actually almost a bit slow at times. However, for the second half of the movie it really degrades into a classical John Woo, over the top, action feast with all pretense of intelligence and any true Mission Impossible feel gone. John Woo is not the right person to make a Mission Impossible movie.As with the first movie if it would not have been labeled Mission Impossible I would probably have given it a higher rating since it is a decent enough, mostly brain dead though, Hollywood action movie. However, I have higher expectations from a movie labeled Mission Impossible.Tom Cruise is quite okay as Ethan Hunt. Dougray Scott is okayish as the bad guy. Sometimes he projects the right big bad and mad bad-guy attitude but sometimes he is just silly and just as over the top as the action scenes. He is supposed to be a mastermind but he comes out as a thug a' la a not so intelligent drug baron in many scenes.The action scenes? Well, they are classical John Woo material. Fast paced with a lot of stunts and things that go boom. They are also, as expected, hugely over the top and unbelievable. They provide a enjoyable visual experience but, as I wrote above, they are not really what I would expect from a Mission Impossible movie.The romance between Hunt and Nyah is the typical Hollywood, let's throw in a sexy girl and some superficial attraction, which develops from get lost to I love you in the matter of a few hours of contact, between the lead character and the girl. Meh! I get the impression that the people that have created these movies so far have not really watched a single full season of Mission Impossible.",Mission - Impossible II

Hugely overrated Hong-Kong director John Woo professes himself a Christian and star/producer Tom Cruise is a self-avowed ""Scientologist"" (whatever that is), so there's the usual hypocritical sexual morality pitted against indulgent bloody violence. The millions of children who will watch this film world-wide could validly conclude that violence is normal and sex non-existent. You would never know, by watching this lengthy stomp-romp, that half the movie audience is female, most of whom are turned off by violence and more interested in relationships. Apparently, Cruise made $75 million from this picture, which was so poor that Paramount fired him for it. That's decadent, too. But we're talking about a global movie industry in which dialogue is barely comprehensible (because it will only get dubbed anyway) and the story is only an excuse for 'action' of the sort that even chimpanzees will watch. A parting thought: the bad guy, played by Dougreay Scott, is trying to steal a whack of money and gets killed for it. Funny, because a big heist is what the good guy, Tom Cruise, pulled off when he made this picture. Funny old world, isn't it.",Mission - Impossible II
148,theshadow908,Totally different style.,6,3 May 2006,"Mission: Impossible was a fast paced espionage thriller that actually made you think, which is what I like in a movie. Since John Woo, who is one of the kings of the action genre, took over for Brian De Palma, you can expect Mission: Impossible II to be an intense action movie with a majorly dumbed down plot. Everything to do with the plot is laid out for us basically right away. Now, all there is to do is sit back and watch those classic John Woo action sequences. In this movie, Ethan Hunt is once again a secret agent, and he is sent on a mission to stop a crooked agent from stealing a deadly virus for his own use.I liked the first Mission: Impossible better because it had a more advanced plot. This Mission: Impossible is just a bland shoot 'em up action film. Now there's nothing wrong with that. The movie was still immensely entertaining. It just didn't fit in with the first film. Even the character of Ethan Hunt, though still played by Tom Cruise, is different. In this movie he doesn't seem as serious about his job. He's more cocky. However, I do like that the character now has absolutely amazing skills in hand to hand combat.Overall, if you're looking for a smart spy thriller like the first film, this ain't it.

This time I'll be brief.It saddens me that what could have been a great series of movies, starting out with de Palmas excellent first a few years ago, has quickly been spoiled by being handed to the least suitable director. John Woo has, if nothing else, proven that with a child's mind, anything can be made cheap, lousy and lame action of the kind one hoped never would rise above talents like van Damne and Lundgren. There is nothing special or original in this movie, just remakes (or rather parodies) of the ol' classic action themes. But what is worse is that Woo manages to add an incredible amount of cheesiness to his 2-hour slow-motion action ballets. White doves appear out of nowhere and some parts of the dialogue could be used as doormats at a kindergarten.Lousy, awful, tragic. That's all I have to say.",Mission - Impossible II

Interpreted with all the professional ethics and artistic and technical virtuosity that Tom Cruise breathes into the portrayal of each of his roles regardless of genre and character; which has already earned him three Oscar nominations.In this second episode of the saga, Ethan Hunt's mission is to intercept ""The Chimera"". An extremely dangerous synthetic virus, which is in the hands of unscrupulous mobsters working in the opaque and deadly world of the biopharmaceutical cartels. Where viruses, and their antidotes, are created to profit off health and life of entire populations.At the beginning of his mission, Ethan meets the beautiful and mysterious Nyah, who comes to life as the delightful and talented Thandie Newton, with whom he lives the most romantic-tragic episode of the saga. His two usual teammates, Luther Strickell interpreted by Ving Rhames and Billy Baird played by John Polson, indefectibly support him; and these intense and tragic events are perfectly underlined by Hans Zimmer's captivating soundtrack.Many factors, among other things, that contribute to make this second opus the best of the saga.

153,TheHonestCritic,"There's a reason why this ""movie"" is labeled ""Mission: Impossible"" (2), because this ""film"" is crap!",4,29 April 2020,"""Mission: Impossible II"" (2000), oh man. Where in the world do I begin? This ""film"" is pathetic, with a capital ""P""! Let's just get the negative stuff out of the way. This ""movie"" has a boring cliched story, over the top to dreadful acting, and some dated special effects. The concept for the storyline was actually fairly decent, a villain is trying to inflict biological warfare onto the world. Now that's a sinister plot, so much potential and possibilities could be utilized! So, you would think with such a cool plot idea, the film makers would take great care in producing an excellent film. They did not. This is one of the most lazily executed films I have ever seen. Don't even get me started on the slow-motion sequences! I think if you took out all of the slow motion shots, the ""movie"" would only be five minutes, maybe. I have never seen so much unnecessary use of slow-motion in a movie. Slow-motion can be very effective when utilized properly, but that's not the case here. I think they just did it, ""because""! Such a same, because the concept for the story had so much potential. The acting, overall, is absolutely terrible and nothing short of a joke. Even Tom Cruise is bad in this ""film""! When you watch him in this ""movie"", you can see his ego exploding on overdrive. It's like he went out of the way to make himself look cool, which is just pompous and stuck-up. Such a crying shame, because Tom Cruise is otherwise a fantastic actor! All of the other actors and actresses range from okay to bad. The only actors that seem to actually be trying in this ""movie"" are: Ving Rhames as Luther, Thandie Newton as Nyah (NO, SERIOUSLY, THAT'S HER NAME. I'LL EXPLAIN WHY THAT NAME IS SO FUNNY AND RIDICULOUS LATER.) The other actor that seems to be putting forth effort is Dougray Scott as Sean, the main villain. To be honest, the villain was actually kind of cool. It's just too bad that the script and direction wasn't any better. As for Thandie Newton's character, Nyah, that name cracks me up. Why? Because that name is what's uttered on my favorite show, ""The Three Stooges"". Whenever any of the stooges are scared, or nervous, they yell: ""nyah!"" Maybe they should have thought of that before they gave Thandie Newton's character that name, because that just takes away all seriousness and credibility. As for the special effects, most of them are passable, but there are a few of them that have not aged well. Probably the worst special effects are the bird shots. Yeah, they couldn't even get real birds to be in this ""film"". You know your movie really sucks when even birds show no interest in it! Now for the positives, yes, there are surprisingly positive elements in this ""film"". I always try to find positives in any movie or TV show I watch. The sets/locations are nice and give the ""film"" a decent atmosphere. Finally, the other positive thing is the soundtrack. The soundtrack was well composed, but, I think the standout is the rock and roll version of the ""Mission: Impossible"" theme. That was a unique take on the theme song, but I think it works. It's just sad that it had to be tied to this diarrhea dump of a ""movie"". There are a couple of scenes that are actually not too bad. The opening scene where he climbs the cliff is kind of exciting, however, it is not relevant to the plot. How ironic! The other good scene is the motorcycle chase and final fight at the end. Even those scenes, they still found ways to screw them up. Not so much the motorcycle chase, but the final fight itself. Way too much slow-motion, and too many pointless distracting cut-scenes. ""Mission: Impossible II"" is an embarrassment to an otherwise decent franchise. But, the sad thing is, it didn't have to be! This ""film"" is, by far, the worst ""Mission: Impossible"" movie in the franchise. I give this ""movie"" 2 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. My advice: if you're a fan of the original TV show, and you watch this movie, you will be disappointed. But, if you still wish to see this ""film"", go ahead. I can't tell you not to see something, however, don't say I didn't warn you! On a final note, I just have to say: Director John Woo, Tom Cruise, what were you thinking?!

And it's somewhat peculiar that the weakest of the three action films is the one made by the most pronounced action-director of them all, John Woo.It's too bad, because I'm a big fan of John Woo, who's made some of my favorite action movies of all time (Hard Boiled and Face/Off immediately come to mind). But I don't know what went wrong here. His signature use of slow motion, which has worked beautifully in the past, is simply tiresome in this movie.The scenes drag on for too long. I'm not advocating the George-Lucas-faster-more-intense-ADD /Bourne/ Bond/ camera-mounted-on-top-of-paint-blender-style of film making, which is so popular in action movies today. But the (for example) slow-motion-flamenco, quasi-sexual-foreplay-car-chase and motorcycle-jousting scenes just go on and on and on to the point that I just want start throwing things at the TV and shout ""Get on with the story!"" Sadly, the story (if there indeed is one) is less than engaging, and the characters are far too dull. I don't buy the supposed chemistry between couch-jumper Cruise and token black girl. The main villain played by Dougray Scott (surely, that can't be a spoiler?) is weak and bland. Anthony Hopkins is there to pick up a paycheck, no more, no less.",Mission - Impossible II

157,mnpollio,Laughably incompetent,2,9 April 2010,"While I was not a fan of the initial overrated film adaptation of the popular TV series, the discovery that new director John Woo was taking over the helm made me decide to give this sequel a chance. Unfortunately, the end result is a laughably incompetent action film. Between this and the equally lamentable Broken Arrow, I am at a loss as to why Woo has any reputation in Hollywood. Tom Cruise returns as IMF agent Ethan Hunt, who matches wits with terrorist Dougray Scott who plans to release a biotoxin in Australia. Ving Rhames returns as Cruise's able-bodied co-hort and Thandie Newton is along for the ride as the token love interest - a cat burglar and former girlfriend to Scott. The screenplay is haphazardly plotted and not especially interesting or suspenseful. There are so many sequences of people ripping off their faces to reveal that they are in reality someone else completely that the effect long since loses any relevance. It also introduces a rather obvious issue that if the person you are impersonating looks to be 6'3"" and you look to be 5'6"" in height why does no one wonder why you have suddenly shrunk? Cruise spends the film glowering, showing off his athletic prowess by doing back flips at the drop of a hat and glaring intently at Newton in a desperate attempt to convince that they have chemistry. Although Scott seems a physical match for Cruise, he is one of the more boring villains in recent memory. Woo directs scenes between Newton/Cruise and Newton/Scott as though he were filming a Calvin Klein ad with endlessly arty filtered shots of blowing scarves and swirling images that nearly border on lampoon. His action scenes definitely qualify for lampoon with the adversaries flying through the air, smashing into solid objects at ridiculous speeds with nary an injury and assorted Road Runner-esqe foolishness that inspires far more titters than adrenaline. The end result is a laughably tedious exercise not worth anyone's time.",Mission - Impossible II
158,troyputland,Mission Possible,5,7 May 2015,"Everything that made Mission: Impossible rare has been peeled away. There's no intense set-pieces, no nifty gadgets and no kick-ass team. Mission: Impossible 2 is a not so impossible mission for one. Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt has the looks, fortitude and strength the women swoon over and the men crave to be. Stripped of it's unconventional anecdotes, John Woo's M:I-2 is just another generic action movie. Cruise's greatest feat is performed before the opening credits feature and the only aspect of an impossible mission comes from Hunt's love interest Nyah (Thandie Newton), who goes undercover to find out the whereabouts of a disease called Chimera from 'crime-lord' Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott in fine villainous form). For a good chunk of the film's second act, Ethan has little to do. Newton's work overstays its welcome. When the twists and turns eventually arrive it's too little, too late. At least Cruise, with his silky mane, looks like he's having a blast, it's just a pity it can't be said for the rest of us. Even the life-like face masks are missing. It's absence is only short lived. In the mean time, Cruise gallivanting the globe will have to do.",Mission - Impossible II

The good guys are great, the bad guys are horrible and the girl needs to be rescued. (Snore).The direction is annoying.  The inappropriate overuse of slow motion in the movie attempts to enhance the drama, but comes across as cheezy.

160,Emerenciano,Really good!,8,7 April 2003,"""Mission: Impossible II"" is a typical action movie! There's all you want when you watch a film of this genre: motor bikes, explosions, fights and an atmosphere of danger in the air. The central plot is quite fictitious, but it's good! I felt it lost something important when compared to the first movie, the art itself. De Palma's direction, besides the wonderful scenes of action, added some mystery and beauty to the story, something John Woo couldn't do. It's something too subjective to be described in a few lines, but watching this second movie makes we realise De Palma and Woo have different points of view. This is positive, because we can compare them and make our conclusions. ""Mission: Impossible II"", although without De Palma's style, is really good. The story is carefully built and it proves John Woo is one of the best action film directors we have nowadays. The scene where Tom Cruise's character and the bad guy take part in a motor bike pursuit is brilliant.

Just terrible.Director Woo went to town on extended slow-mo close-ups of Tom Cruise and his girl played by Thandie Newton. OMG, if I see another close-up zoom to her nose I'm going to get sick. The support team really sucked too. They gave old reliable Ving Rhames nothing to do, and who the heck with this Simon Pegg lookalike who just laughed and did nothing?The final scene of an extended car crash with stuff blowing up all over and motorcycle after motorcycle really let you know that there was no plot in this movie, so the director decided to blow things up all over.It didn't work. It's impossible to like this flick. Cruise smiled too much, did his modicum of fighting, flexed his younger muscles, but the flick still fell flat.

163,luke-a-mcgowan,"More of a soap opera than a fun film, Woo's overly sexualised Mission Impossible fun is lacking in thrills and tension",5,14 August 2015,"I've never ever seen a director so bad at directing an actress as John Woo was at directing Thandie Newton. I am without words for how badly he handles who I consider one of the most underrated actresses of her generation. The only person who is more blatant at this was Michael Bay directing Transformers, when he had Megan Fox posing on the motorbike. I'll come right back to this. Mission Impossible 2 opens with some guy doing some darn impressive climbing scenes in the mountains. I say some guy because whilst he looks like Ethan Hunt and sounds like Ethan Hunt - this guy is most certainly not Ethan Hunt. John Woo takes the frenetic, high-octane guy that we've seen in every other film and ramps the charisma up to 11 and turns down everything else. They could've taken Tom Cruise out and replaced him with Pierce Brosnan and honestly it would've felt more right. Hunt is too flirty and suave in this film - Cruise is at his best when his back is against the wall (as in the other four Mission Impossibles, where he has been a rogue agent), so to have him carrying out a fairly basic IMF mission means that the tension is gone from him. This is just another mission to him, and it shows in his lack of energy at times.To pair with Cruise is Newton, who I really enjoyed watching. She's gorgeous, dignified and even a bit catlike in her thieving scenes (if only there was more than one in the entire film). However, after Hunt recruits Hall (and bangs her for fun), he is told by his boss that Newton's role is just to pretend to be the villain's girlfriend. Hunt's reaction to this news is about what I imagine Newton's was. ""I thought we were recruiting her for her talent"" he snarls, barely able to conceal his contempt. Again, this is pretty much how I felt whenever I watched awful, sexualised scenes of Newton - whether its unnecessary cleavage camera work, or her asking Hunt ""what are you going to do, spank me?"" in the middle of a tense confrontation. Splice in the porn-quality score and suggestive camera work, and Mission Impossible suddenly changes genres.Hunt's mission is to have Hall infiltrate Sean Ambrose's confidences. Of course, many are suspicious of this, including Ambrose's loyal henchman Stamp (Richard Roxburgh, who can't seem to decide on an accent). Ambrose himself is aware that Hall is probably a mole, but he goes along with it because he's a sex-crazed psychopath (quote, ""I am gagging for it""), and when Stamp dares to ask if he's sure, Ambrose politely agrees and cuts off Stamp's finger for some reason. While Hall infiltrates Ambrose in Sydney (oh, this movie takes place in Australia for some reason), Hunt and his team (an excellent Ving Rhames and an unbearable John Polson, who in three seconds creates the most excruciating Australian stereotype ever put to film) set up in the outback. WHY ON EARTH ARE THEY IN THE OUTBACK? There's nowhere in ALL OF SYDNEY that they can set up? The Australian slang is excruciatingly manufactured coming from the actors, even from native Australian Polson.Its cut together with typical John Woo action - two guns, flying pigeons, endless slow-mo sequences, and an explosion is always warranted. Seriously, there are points where explosions and slow-mo is incorporated where I think ""why are you doing this, Woo, why?"" Two motorbikes collide in midair and explode for some reason, instead of just scuffing each other and falling heavily to the ground. Meanwhile, Hunt (who misses a big ""impossible mission"" sequence in this movie) has one scene where he must destroy the Chimera virus, and despite Rhames shouting helplessly that he must hurry, Woo decided to shoot Cruise in slow-motion. Its excruciating to watch.Mission Impossible 2 is an action soap opera. The music, overacting, and even the way people move around the room and discuss betrayals. Its fun and harmless if you turn your brain off, but focusing you will see its a giant blob of stuff that Woo should never have been allowed to make under the Mission Impossible banner. He should never be allowed to work with Thandie Newton again, that's for sure.",Mission - Impossible II

167,Gubby-Allen,Bloody hard work,3,17 December 2001,"Spoilers withinAdmittedly, when I watched this film, it was late & I was absolutely knackered, thus it had to be paused at least 3 times for the missus to explain what was going on, as it went way over my head.I was somewhat surprised therefore to see reviewers complain of a tedious, weak plot. I agree with the many though that have said it was boring. This wasn't an awful film, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it.As gorgeous as the female lead was, the romance was ridiculous.Also, like so many films, it seemed to be all about the big, high budget finale & one or two other interspersed scenes with some fancy fighting. For the other 75% of the film though, very little went on, it seemed the plot (and I use the term plot in the loosest possible sense) was just plonked in without much thought, just as a prelude for the next stunt scene.Yes, the stunts were impressive, amazing even, but anyone with half a brain knew exactly how it'd all end up. It was just a case of waiting for it. Wait we did. It must've taken 30 minutes just to close the story off & even the missus (who enjoyed it far more than me) had lost the will to live about 20 minutes from the end.I also find films where people takes others faces off & swap them with there own very tedious. Had it just happened in the one scene on the plane at the start, it might just have been ok. But it had been repeated half a dozen times by the end, so you spend the rest of the film wasting your time wondering who is actually doing the speaking & missing the lines, as I obviously did. You half expected Tom Cruise to reach for a gun, only to peel off an outer layer of plastic & find it's an aubergine, it got that silly.I spent years doing A-Levels & a degree, trying every method know to man to stay awake, while reading theories & attempting to store information in my head. Once those days are gone, you don't want go through it again, taking in spy films, where the characters are unlikely to mean anything to you.Had this story been told by an old uncle or grandad & condensed down into 10 minutes, it may possibly have been interesting, but beyond that, it's just not really a story worthy of a 2 hour film.Having slated it though, it's not awful. I've seen far worse films & one or two stunts are watchable in moderation, but in a time where nothing seems beyond stuntman & film crews, the days of making the audience go 'whoooah' are gone.4/10",Mission - Impossible II
168,basrutten,John Woo's genius is destroyed by Tom Cruise's ego,3,12 October 2001,"Contrary to the first Mission Impossible movie, this time there is a plot that can actually be understood and the pacing is much better then in the first M:IUnfortunately, this is where the good points stop. The story suffers severely from ridiculous plot-twists (all those scenes in which somebody removes one of those masks are totally unbelievable), the action scenes are sometimes flashy but they are usually so over-the-top that is becomes utterly nonsensical (I mean, is it possible to ride a motor bike at over 100 mph and then making a car explode by hitting it only once in the fuel tank, while aiming by only looking in the rear view mirror of the motor cycle ?). Another fine example is the scene where Tom Cruise jumps over a 100 metre cliff for no apparent reason, reaches the top of the mountain and is shot at by helicopter with a missile that contains his orders in the form of an exploding pair of sunglasses. Why ?The movie is full of this kind of exaggerated action scenes, which are obviously only meant to show how 'cool' Tom Cruise is: he shoots like the Terminator, fights like Bruce Lee, drives like Michael Schumacher, gets women like James Bond etc. He is so invincible that it takes all the suspense out of the movie.It's really a shame that a great director like John Woo has wasted his talents on showing off Mr. Cruises ego, because there are some points in the movie where Woo's genius actually showes up, but they are few and far between.

169,theinaniloquent,"""Expect the impossible again""",3,10 December 2011,"A secret agent is sent to Sydney, to find and destroy a genetically modified disease called ""Chimera""Now, if you've read the review for the original, I loved the movie. It felt like a REAL spy film, where everything is so secretive like and so 'code-named.' For this reason, the second film seemed to set my standards. But folks, I highly suggest skipping this film and watch the 3rd because the movie was so unexplained, so pointless, so bad... Now, don't take me the wrong way, I don't believe the film is the worst thing out there. I have seen much worse, much better, but this film sets out to be one of the worst scenes out there. In the beginning, I thought the movie was unavailing pretty okay; all changing when he sets out to find the girl. The following, say, 45 minutes is a relationship status with Tom Cruise. They pointlessly drive in cars and crash each other until they go home and have sex. So... stupid. The way they inserted the action scenes was beyond me, they were so pointless and flaw...full. The second half, thankfully, had some redeeming qualities. The only I could find is the action and special effects, everything else was just horrible. Sadly, I found myself waiting for the movie to be over and watch the 3rd but I forced myself to see anything new. The acting, yeah, was pretty bad too. Tom Cruise is really not the most likable character in his films, and in this one, he just fails in multiple levels (thankfully succeeding in the 3rd.) Now when there seems to be nothing else to complain about, we have the score. Wait... I'm complaining about the score? Yeah. I was surprised to see that my favorite composer, Hans Zimmer, constructed this disaster. They ruined the theme, one, by redoing it with a guitar. Sounds pretty cool, but sounds pretty not. Then the rest of the film has this (I'm trying to find the word) Hispanic (?) soundtrack. The film is a disgrace to the Mission Impossible films. I suggest not seeing this, ever, even if your extremely bored, with friends. The movie will surely make you want to weep for humanity. That bad. 3/10.",Mission - Impossible II
170,Shiva-11,"Sit back, relax and put your brain on cruise control",7,28 May 2000,"Mission Impossible II: When you're Ethan Hunt, superspy extraordinaire, nothing ruins your day quicker than a madman peddling a stolen killer virus that could spell global genocide.  But, then again, it's not that unusual either The main complaint about the first theatrical version of Mission Impossible was that the story was too convoluted and consequently most people couldn't follow what was going on.  Personally, I disliked the movie because of the weak characters, lack of tension, and the horribly choreographed action sequences were (the helicopter-in-the-Chunnel scene was the final straw for me). Not wanting to repeat the past, the producers mercilessly dumbed down the plot for this one.  Unfortunately, they did it a little too well: the story bogs down whenever the guns aren't blazing, the dialogue sounds like they pulled it from a dime-store novel, the love scenes are tepid, and the villain embodies apathy at best.  Thank god for John Woo!Woo achieved virtual demi-god status as a director of Hong Kong action films and it was only a matter of time before he was wooed (no pun intended) by Hollywood.  Although his first North American features - ""Broken Arrow"" and ""Hard Target"" - enjoyed only a modicum of success, the public took notice with the release of ""Face Off"".  MI 2 proves that he just keeps getting better. Anyone familiar with his work would instantly recognize the trademark Woosims in this film: fluttering doves, slow motion action sequences, beautifully choreographed bullet ballets, adrenaline pumping car chases and impossible stunts (amazingly Cruise did most of his own stuntwork, much to the chagrin of Woo and the studio).  Although several of the action sequences border on the ridiculous (how many bullets can you fire at a fleeing hero without hitting him?  A whole lot), yet they are fun to watch - the last ten minutes of the movie are worth the price of admission alone.

171,carlos37andre,Way too serious,3,8 February 2018,"I'll make this short. If the movie was what the last 25 minutes are, it would be perfect (in a weird way). But sadly, it is not.I think that the main problem of MI2 is that it take itself too serious, like, two guys jump from their bikes and collide with each other IN THE F# AIR, but you also are supposed to be worried about a global virus that will destroy the world. And you just don't buy it.But there are also a lot of shitty things here, the romance between Ethan and Nyah happened so fast, the guy is literally risking his life for her, after one night (or less).The soundtrack is sometimes a real mess, you go to some mexican type of music in some scenes (with no-sense at all) to some heavy metal type of music in another one. And it just don't fit for the majority of the time.And, ok, we have to talk about the slow-mo, look, Matrix is fantastic, amazing, but the bunch of crap that came after it is surreal. It seems like the director just saw Matrix and thought ""we have to put more slow-mo in the movie! It will be great!"". But, well... no. A lot of scenes you can notice that they were clearly shoot with normal cameras, and slowled in pos.Tom Cruise is amazing in the film when the subject is action scenes. The guy let they hold a KNIFE above his eyes! The dude is a monster, really. He's stunt's are by far the best thing in the whole movie.Well, in short, Mission: Impossible II it's really not a great film (in fact, it's bad), but the last 30 minutes of it are very watchable (you can search for it on YT if you really want to see), the rest of it is almost everything just boring, way over the top, but yet, very serious about it's crazy plot.",Mission - Impossible II

173,rparham,Not quite as good a Mission,7,12 June 2006,"It is difficult to think of a sequel that deviates from it's predecessor's style and format as much as Mission: Impossible II. The 1996 original was a reasonably faithful updating of the formula of the original 1960s television series, with some variations, as to be expected. Mission: Impossible II is a full-on action film, however, loaded with fights, car chases and some outrageously unbelievable moments. It is not necessarily unentertaining, but it is a bit of a drop from the first film.Mission: Impossible II opens in Sydney, Australia, where bio-technologist Dr. Nekhorvich (Rade Sherbedgia) has decided to smuggle a deadly virus out of the pharmaceutical company he works for and attempt to turn it and the antidote over to the U.S. government. On his way to America, he is murdered and the virus stolen by rogue IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) who plans to sell it back to the company for millions. IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is recruited to stop Ambrose from fulfilling his mission, and in doing so forms an alliance with an old lover of Ambrose, Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton), a thief who Hunt promptly falls in love with himself.Where Mission: Impossible was criticized for having an overly complicated plot, Mission: Impossible II is pretty much the exact opposite. The plot is straightforward and, frankly, relatively thin. Mission: Impossible II replaces complex plotting with over-the-top, high octane action. Directed by Hong Kong action supremo John Woo, Mission: Impossible II is definitely very much reflective of his individual style. Woo is responsible for balletic action operas in his native country, including such films as The Killer and Hard Boiled, which were distinctive for their almost non-stop action sequences that were assembled with extreme style. Woo's two prior American films, Hard Target and Broken Arrow, also are reflective of his style, although both lacked the kick of his Asian work. Mission: Impossible II is more of his traditional element, full of hand to hand combat, with extreme, borderline unbelievable results.In bringing his unique style to Mission: Impossible II, Woo film has refashioned the series from a cerebral suspense thriller to a modern day James Bond knock-off, with Hunt at center stage and all the supporting players kept at arm's length. Mission: Impossible II delivers on some impressive sequences, and they are by no means boring, but the absolute absurdity of it all quickly begins to wear out it's welcome. But it is fun at times, and Woo delivers some pretty pictures, full of many of his trademark elements (including plenty of doves in action sequences).On the character front, Mission: Impossible II is fairly bare bones. Thandie Newton is capable as thief turned secret agent Nyah, but her romance with Hunt is fairly uninvolving. There isn't a lot of chemistry or draw to the two of them, and at times their relationship seems like a plot necessity and not an integral component of the story. Dougray Scott does the appropriate amount of mustache twirling as despicable villain Ambrose, but he is occasionally over the top and manages to make his character into a bit of a caricature at times. Ving Rhames returns as Luther Stickle, the only character to return from the first film other than Hunt, but he and fellow team member Billy Baird (John Polson) are given cameos at best. Cruise is once again capable, but hardly amazing as Ethan Hunt. He delivers what is necessary for the role, but nothing else.Mission: Impossible II could be viewed in the larger sense as another example of the dumbing down of American movies. The producers, reeling from complaints of Mission: Impossible's complexity and also possibly it's lack of action have delivered the exact antithesis with the sequel: a film which looks good, moves fast, and in which lots of stuff gets blowed up real good. But that is all there is, and while entertaining, you can't help but think something is missing at the core.",Mission - Impossible II
174,Aidan McGuinness,More Boo-hoo than Woo-hoo,5,29 January 2002,"After watching ""Mission: Impossible II"" I realized I had made one critical mistake while watching the movie - I possessed a brain which was working. You shouldn't use your brain while watching this idiotic fare.Now it may be that MI:II was an action pastiche. Certainly you must wonder how Cruise could deliver some incredibly hammy lines - how he'll find the love of his life (whom he knew for about five minutes), how he'll stop the bad guys, etc. - without cracking up at the absurdity of it all. The plot too is laughable - it's Mr. Killer Virus and his friend The Antidote! Oh my can we guess who's going to be infected with the virus and force Cruise to get the last bit of antidote? Original and clever, it ain't. People complained the first one was too difficult to follow? Don't worry, you'll have no problems here...Oh and as a plot device the ""face mask"" must win some award for being the most over-used plot tool ever.So there's no acting or script to speak of. What's left is - of course - the action scenes. This is where the real humour (it must be) kicks in. Ethan (Cruise's character) demonstrates degrees of athleticism that would merit a place in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" as he back-flips and cavorts his body all over the place, knocking down the baddies aplenty. His skill is not limited to martial arts as he engages in gunfights using the ""infinite ammo"" cheat to dance (in slow motion of course - this is John Woo directing) around knocking off small armies of henchmen without being grazed himself (couldn't muss up that hair could we?). And I thought it was bad enough - but get a load of that final car/bike chase. It gave me a good laugh if nothing else.Once the laughter died, I decided I hadn't seen a very good movie. Sure Woo may make it slick using his renowned slo-mo visual style but it can't help save the plot or script or general nonchalance I felt towards the whole movie. Must try harder. 5/10",Mission - Impossible II
175,Ziya90,A Fire Bird,8,11 June 2016,"I see Mission: Impossible 2 as ""Hulk 03"" of M:I movies. Both were hated and bashed by moviegoers, although those were excellent. For example Hulk 03 still has the best CGI and it has lots of action, but people remember the first 40 minutes, being very boring for them while the real boring one with bad CGI was the second one. People say that this sequel with a boring first half has a different style than the original first film, but wasn't it supposed to be like that? If you ask me, the first film was an exclusively stylish, low key espionage thriller, but it was little boring and slow paced at times. I liked and very enjoyed even the third movie with magical JJ Abrams touch! However, this second film perfectly delivers as an action packed and believe me that cliché virus story and the dated romance is not the point. This is a John Woo movie! In this sequel, now Ethan Hunt is a trained martial artist, a gunfighter, what would be the best that could happen? In this movie, the mission teller device does not terminate itself by smoldering, because this is a John Woo movie! In the second half, you are awarded with some incredible stunt work and action sequences! Also I think the best soundtrack for a M:I movie is here, too. The things that Hunt performs by that motorbike is amazing. If you expect a Bullitt type of a movie, of course you will be disappointed, but it is pure action and pure entertainment. If you look at the posters of the first two films, you can see that while the first one looks like a classical, old school spy thriller, the second one prepares you for a hell ride! We watch a different, tricky Ethan Hunt here equipped with lots of skills, almost like a single army and I love that! This is not a sophisticated or intellectual action film, but it is definitely not an empty or dumb summer blockbuster. The tone of the movie is just perfect for a M:I movie of course with a different touch by Woo! The mountain scene of the film is a hilarious and pure joy! The last 20 minutes of the film is an awesome action packed! Is it exaggerating? Yes. Is it overblown? No. Is it hilarious and cool? Definitely Yes! John Woo is a great action filmmaker and he doesn't make movies like this anymore.",Mission - Impossible II

This second was a fun jaunt down memory lane, but never the less it doesn't hold a candle very well to it's predecessor in 1996. There was a whole cast with him that worked. He is not superman, he can't leap tall buildings on his own! He like others needs a good team backing him up, bigger than he had in this one. The fights were pretty good as was the chase scenes were a bit fresher than last, but a couple of the fighting segments were in fact over done. Then with that same old John Woo special dance number that he puts in everything he directs. I enjoyed Hugh Stamper and the arch-bad guy Sean, referring to Hunt's love interest as a 'monkey' also the incredible coast line in Australia. I did not however enjoy the very ending with the 'Chimera' effecting her body that not only did the good guys fix her with no seconds left on the clock but, that whole park carnival scene at the very ending. Just a bit like attending the Disneyland in Sydney...seemed an inappropriate end. The biggest blast for me was, when I learned of what Cruise made on this one... $75 Million and a 10% take on the gross. I thought, gosh, he only made $70 Million for first and no gross-points, and I like that one better. 5/10 is all this sequel yields for me. Thx - IMDb.com",Mission - Impossible II
177,robsta23,At Least It's Less Pretentious,7,30 July 2015,"One thing I couldn't stand about the first Mission: Impossible is how it was trying to seem really complex - especially with the motif of the bible verse and how Ethan Hunt inexplicably knew how to contact his enemy - when it was really just a simple action film. This film is simple and knows it, making it easier to just enjoy for the ride. Sometimes simplicity (at least in plot) is just more fitting, and I think it is the case for this franchise of movies.The plot is literally just what the plot section on this movie's IMDb page says, so there you have it. Once you get past that you can enjoy the film.As in the first film, I'm not sure how the filmmakers pull off the sequences involving the elaborate masks, but it is a pretty brilliant effect whether it is CGI (when they remove the mask) or if it is an actual mask - it is so hard to tell. One plot hole though for this movie: how do the enemies have the exact same elaborate- mask-making technology as the spy agency which Ethan Hunt works for?I find this film a little more fun than the first, but it is also filled with more clichés in my opinion. We have a woman on Hunt's side acting as a double agent to gain the villain's trust, we have villains who want to create an epidemic for profit (granted I don't know when this story element originated) and there is almost too much slow motion used in this movie - and it's the type where they didn't even to bother trying to put it into 24fps as modern slow- motion works in film.An okay action film just barely better than the first, which doesn't say much. I hope I'll enjoy 3 and 4 more when I rewatch them - I had never seen numbers 1 and 2 before, strange I know.",Mission - Impossible II

The first shot of her (which is repeated over and over) is just a shot down the front of her blouse.She does little more than seduce, decorate the set, and, at the end, look pale and wan.She does have one lone, solitary scene in where her character is not totally predictable.When `Mission Impossible' was on television it was obvious that while Peter Graves was the star it was clear that an ensemble was needed to solve whatever predicament the team found themselves in.Not so here -- this was more of a James Bond-type story.  No one else was needed.  Cruise was the only real character' in this movie.Both John Woo and Tom Cruise are capable of so much more than this movie -- which is only a money machine for both of them.At one point Cruise's character is asked a question:  His reply was `Risky'; if he had only said `Business' I would have found something in this movie to enjoy.",Mission - Impossible II

Like I say, it is well crafted and some excellent special effects and really outstanding stunts. But, it has problems too.At over 2 hours, they should have cut 20 minutes of action and added 10 minutes of relationship building between Cruise and his new girlfriend - whatever her name is. As it was, the action got boring by the end. Also, the notion that Cruise would instantly fall madly in love with this girl is ridiculous!

I wasn't expecting much because this movie got worse reviews than the snooze-fest that was the original. However, this movie managed to keep my attention a lot more than the original and had a lot more action.People have criticized that the plot is more like James Bond than Mission Impossible. They're probably right, but at least the story is easy to follow in this one. I thought the twists with people wearing masks were actually pretty clever.Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt and once again proves that he can carry an action blockbuster with no problem. Thandie Newton is eye candy and plays a real role in the story. The main villain of the film, Sean Ambrose, played by Dougray Scott, makes this a love triangle. Ambrose is a decent if not great villain.This movie has quite a lot of action. The motorcycle chase and subsequent hand-to-hand combat between Hunt and Ambrose at the end will give you the bang for your buck. There is also an exciting gun sequence at Ambrose's laboratory.They scenery in Australia is really lovely and I liked the update of the M:I theme song. I don't like that Anthony Hopkins only had a minor role, though.After the dull first installment, this movie was a breath of fresh air. The action and romance between the leads makes this a great summer blockbuster. It's not art, but it sure is fun.RATING: B+",Mission - Impossible II

The original series involved convoluted plots, deceptions, rubber masks and high tech gadgets executed by a team of experts, emphasis on the team. The original series wasn't John LeCarre or Hitchcock with all those rubber mask switcheroos, but it was plot driven and had no flash. Also, it had almost no violence, sex or chase scenes.

The plot is boring and hackneyed and no one thought to give the villain any motivation at all.

188,AnishMisra,Mission: Impossible II Review,6,21 July 2018,"Mission: Impossible - 2 is a film directed by John Woo. Many people have cited this to be the worst entry in the M: I series. I can also say the very same thing after I saw it again. Plot: Ethan and his IMF team have to retrieve a biological weapon called Chimer from rogue IMF agent Sean Ambrose, who intends to make a profit out of it.Story and direction: After loving the film Face/Off (again by John Woo and by far his best Hollywood attempt) I would say that I had high expectations from this film. First, let us get on with the positives. The set design and scenery of Australia is very beautifully utilized. I feel in love with Australia after watching this film. The cinematography of the film is what enhanced the scenery. Hans Zimmer's score is also awesome. The scenes had an additional layer of tension thanks to the BGM. Most of the action scenes too worked for me. Now, for the negatives of the film. The plot itself is very boring. I was invested in the first 15 minutes or so of the film and towards the end, the film gets interesting. It is the middle half/45 minutes that are so badly written. It is also full of unnecessary drama that the film didn't need. The villain I felt was set up very nicely and provided nice characterization. But he was underplayed as the makers wanted to focus on Nyah and Ethan's romance, which was dull and drab. Even for a moment I wasn't invested in that part of the story. And sometimes, the action scenes did have a lot of slo-mo. I understand that slo-mo is a technique that is used to enhance a particular scene. But in this film, it is used in almost every scene. And that finished its effect that it tried to create and irritated me after some time. 
Performances: Tom Cruise and Ving Rhames were just spot on and gave charismatic performances. Thandie Newton was also good, it is just her character felt unnecessary to the plot. Dougray Scott did give an effective performance but it would have well appreciated if he was given more importance. Richard Roxburgh and Brendan Gleeson did provide good supporting roles. And finally, Anthony Hopkins. Although his role was more of a cameo, it was good to see him. Favorite Scene: It was where Hunt and his team decide to infiltrate Biocyte and destroy Chimera while Sean and his team decode the steps Ethan will take to destroy the Chimera. This scene for once displayed the capabilities of Sean as a capable villain giving a toigh competition to our hero, Ethan Hunt.Verdict: The film could have been better if it would have stuck to the tension and thrill that any spy film needs instead of focusing on the romance. It felt like a romantic drama instead of a spy thriller film. This film felt like a detour from the previous instalment. I would say this film as more of a time pass and can be avoided. Only watch it for the stunts and the charismatic Tom Cruise.I am going with a 6/10.",Mission - Impossible II
189,schroeder-gustavo,Drastic change in tone,6,24 July 2015,"Mission: Impossible is a great spy thriller, the first in the Mission: Impossible series is one I really enjoy, mostly due to the directing and very suspenseful scenes. This brings me to Mission: Impossible II's biggest flaw: It's an entirely different movie than the first one.This film was directed by John Woo, and it really shows. Watching this movie, you simply have to praise the beautiful shots, the score by Hans Zimmer and the action sequences are very well shot and really exciting. But, simply but, the movie is just dumb. Things like Tom Cruise jumping off a speeding motorcycle against another man and not dying and pretty much all the stunts during that bike sequence make absolutely no sense whatsoever. The movie is eye candy, though. Every scene looks beautiful.Like I said, the main problem I have with this movie is that it was established in the first Mission: Impossible what kind of character Ethan Hunt is. The man's is a spy who is very focused on his work, always takes that very seriously and, although he is a very charismatic person, he always takes his job very seriously. He's a vulnerable person, as well, not some invincible man who can do a million stunts and take on 100 guys and not die. In this movie, it seems they just tried to make him this old school James Bond, playboy, not worried about anything type of person. Why was he rock climbing in the beginning of the movie? To show a cool shot of Tom Cruise rock climbing with no ropes, of course. After having established who the character of Ethan Hunt was going to be, this movie just takes all the good things about the original and just craps on them.Overall, I can still find some enjoyment in Mission: Impossible II, but the movie works a lot better if just viewed as a straight-up John Woo shoot-em up action movie than a Mission: Impossible movie. Not a strong entry in the series, this one can be skipped.",Mission - Impossible II
190,kergillian,John Woo makes this film everything it is...,7,8 April 2001,"If not for John Woo, this film would probably be quite horrid. The script needs *major* work, but the film works because of Woo's brilliance. Beautifully shot from end to end, this film survives on how gorgeous it is, and how amazing the action scenes are.The biggest problem with the film is the pacing. The first hour and change is slow and all background, then all of a sudden there's three huge fast-paced action sequences in less than an hour. In fact, the film only seems to get good about an hour in. Too much information is given, and the outcome is so predictable that I knew how it would end less than halfway through. Also, the romantic aspect was much too cheezy and seemed to not only go overboard (and I *hate* Hollywood endings! Should have had a Ronin ending...) but seems to have little relevance. And while we're at it, Billy's character needed more screen time and more importance considering he was supposedly a member of the 'team'. Actually, it didn't seem like much of a 'team', should have been more team oriented action. I though the first action sequence (invasion of chem company) should have happened much earlier, which could have set up the story in a more interesting way (oh, nice touch to have an almost identical drop as the first film). As it stands, I liked the climbing scenes (Iko Iko was a nice touch - exact same music as opened Rain Man...coincidence?? I think not;) I liked the attempted theft scene. However, the Hopkins scene was tedious (too long and poorly scripted) and the car chase was frivolous (gotta have those chase scenes!!) and the romantic scenes were simple a waste of time and film.The final two action sequences were vintage Woo however. The film picks up and *bam* great choppy repeat cuts, great stunts...and Cruise was *almost* convincing with that amusing martial arts/WWF kicking style...if only Ving Rhames had a bigger part...Overall: this film was snazzy. It had spit-and-polish but wasn't *too* glossy. And although I don't expect intellect from a M:I film of all things, at least it could have had a decent plot. But the classic Woo action scenes make up for it to a point; a single dove flying through the flames as Cruise walks by...visually stunning! 7/10.",Mission - Impossible II
191,caseynicholson,Far From a Great Movie--But Not Bad if You're Expecting The Worst,4,4 August 2015,"Expectations are everything when it comes to watching a movie. The last time I watched this film, I was watching it in preparation for the latest MI movie, and seeing it for the first time since 2000 just made me sick to my stomach. It is a far cry from the original in the franchise, and there are a multitude of scenes that just make it a silly movie that is overdone with action and goofy camera work. At the time I gave the film 1/10 stars. I was just terribly disappointed in it, compared to the other Tom Cruise MI films.That said, I recently gave it another try and went into things expecting an absolutely atrocious film. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that it was a fair bit more stomachable when I went into it expecting the worst. The film is directed by John Woo, who is a famous director in Asia, and as such it emulates ninja movies and the like. There are plenty of martial arts scenes, along with gratuitous scenes of explosions and silly slow motion effects.Still, if you can get past the cinematography, this isn't that bad of a film. There are certainly worse movies out there. Well, OK. It's still a bad movie. But not crazy bad. Just bad. A long story short the script isn't horrible, it's just the style of the film that makes it hard to watch. And the final fight scene is just ridiculous.

192,refinedsugar,When sequels go wrong,3,14 March 2001,"I'm not a fan of MI:2 for so many reasons, but none more than because they messed with everything, changed it all. I don't champion the original MI, but it was slick, it entertained, it made sense from one point to another. This sequel is just an ungodly mess. It's as if someone said 'can we take everything that was wrong with the original and amplify it tenfold'. Even Tom Cruise (who I thought was a perfect fit in the original) feels out of place ... doing weirdly angled kicks and spinning off motorbikes.John Woo can make good movies, I know this, I think you know this, but this is far from one of them. I strongly wonder if he was the right guy for this project. I ponder this because I didn't even find the action scenes that great and we're talking about John Woo here. Between the doves, action scenes that seem so far removed from reality, we also get a bunch of people switching faces. The amount of times they use this convention to further the silly string plot is truly absurd. All wrapped in a flick that feels like nothing a Mission Impossible movie should feel like. Of course, saying all that, won't stop us from seeing a Mission Impossible 3.

195,cofemug,pared-down john woo,5,29 May 2000,"When I first heard that John Woo was doing another movie, I thought great. When I heard that it was mission: impossible 2, I thought awesome.  When I learned on Tuesday before it came out that 40 minutes had been cut out, I became leery.  Yes, you heard me right, this is not the director's cut of the movie.  OK, maybe it is, but it is not the first cut.  Apparently the first cut was patent John Woo with more violence, going for an 'R' rating, and much less romance.  It was John Woo, but then the studio brought in a guy who cut 40 minutes out, and added some romance between the two characters.  But enough of that, the actual movie review:This is not John Woo.  It had some parts in it that were great, but the movie's pacing was sort of off, and the action scenes were a bit choppy. The rhythm that Woo generally has is absent.  See the scene in Face/Off featuring Somewhere over the rainbow for a good example of that, or the church.  But Woo is a master, and studios should not tough that.  The plot is inane, but I didn't care.  My point was that it should have been fun and more intense.  Either way, I don't think that I could sit through this again, except for if they restore it.  I can't wait for the DVD, maybe they restored the first cut, but until then see Gladiator.  I sat through that twice, and would go again.----5",Mission - Impossible II

My biggest problem with this movie is that the characters keep changing faces too quickly and easily(You will have to see the film to know what I am talking about). The main reason that this film is better is the director, John Woo, nobody on the planet directs action like this man, nobody.

199,rcolgan,"Bad Plot, But Some Great Action",6,21 August 2015,"Just like the first ""Mission: Impossible"" film was entirely different to the TV show it was based on, ""Mission: Impossible II"" is nothing like it's 1996 predecessor. The slow, tension building pace Palma used in the first film, has been replaced by John Woo's love of fast paced action and insane shootouts. Woo draws from the auteurist action movies he made in the east like ""The Killer"" in order to bring his own brand of high octane action to western filmmaking. If anyone doubted how different Woo's style would be, he immediately distances his style from the first film in the first 5 minutes. Whilst ""Mission: Impossible"" had its agents receive missions in stylish way that resembled a Bond movie, with a cassette tape being delivered on a plane before detonating in a puff of smoke, that approach was apparently not extreme enough for the generation that made films like ""Bad Boys"" a hit. So instead the mission is delivered to Hunt as he climbs a cliff, with a helicopter firing down the assignment in a missile containing a pair of sunglasses, which he listens to before they explode in a ball of flame. It's completely pointless and serves no purpose to the plot. But it's still an awesome introduction to the film, and sets the tone for the ludicrous and enjoyable action to come. To match ridiculous action sequences like this, the plot is similarly as ridiculous and over the top. This time Ethan's mission is to retrieve and destroy a genetically engineered disease called 'Chimera', before a group of terrorists led by formal IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) get a hold of it and release it to the public. To get close to him Ethan is told to recruit Sean's ex- girlfriend Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) so she can seduce him. But of course as the typical American action hero, Hunt falls in love with her and thus must both stop the terrorists and save the girl.Coincidentally, just like the first film had a heavy Hitchcock influence through its visual style and slow pacing, this film has a plot that is heavily inspired by Hitchcock's ""Notorious"". However unlike Notorious where there was a genuine connection between the two leads, here Cruise and Newton share no such chemistry. They hardly even spend any time together, having only a short amount of screen time with a little flirting, a short car race, and a single night of passion. But for the action movie formula, this is apparently enough to justify them being madly in love.This wouldn't be a problem if this film did the same as the first ""Mission: Impossible"" and spent minimal time on character and story. But here a great portion of the film hinges on Cruise worrying for her and it doesn't work since no real connection is established between the pair. There's also several plot holes and continuity errors, with characters just showing up in random places with no explanation whatsoever. Although in the films defence, supposedly the original cut was intended to be over 3 hours long, but had to be cut down for a cinematic release which would explain most of these problems. Regardless, it's easy to look past this weak plotting, because as always Woo's real strength relies on his action sequences. And as usual he's on top form. He transforms Cruise from the stealthy espionage spy he played in the first film, into an all American action hero similar to the likes of John Rambo. Hunt fights through seemingly unbeatable odds, gunning down terrorists and blowing up cars, all whilst hardly gaining a single scratch because he's just that deadly. And of course Woo throws all his usual trademarks into the mix, like Cruise constantly dual wielding pistols, the gratuitous but cool slow motion and of course random doves being thrown into the climax. But even for a director like Woo who made his name through over the top sequences like the one take hallway sequence in ""Hard Boiled"", this still feels a little overdone. For example, at one point in the film when Cruise is breaking into a terrorist hideout, a door blows up and a dove literally flies through the flames. Moments like this are so ridiculous that they end up feeling less like a genuine action movie and more like a flat out parody. Even with these moments that go a little too far, it can't be denied that nobody does action quite the same as Woo does it. If his brand of insane violence didn't appeal in his previous work like ""Face Off"" or ""A Better Tomorrow"", it won't appeal here. But if you do enjoy his adrenaline fuelled style, then you'll likely enjoy it here. And whilst it may not be the strongest of the series, it's nonetheless another fun outing for the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise.",Mission - Impossible II

The ridiculous action, over-the-top dialogue, overuse of slow-mo and a very weird score makes this somewhat entertaining, and I can definitely see why this is a guilty pleasure for a lot of people. But yeah, I didn't really like this. I think my main gripe is that Tom Cruise and Thandie Newton have negative amounts of chemistry, and given that a lot of scenes are just of those two, it makes it quite boring to watch. That's another thing - despite this being really over the top, I honestly found it a bit boring to watch with the exception of the thoroughly entertaining third act, which is the only place where this film truly hits its stride. The spy aspect is still fun, but again, there is just so much filler that it never really becomes truly entertaining, and that's the real problem with this film.

Instead I saw a by-the-numbers James Bond ripoff.One would have expected better of screenwriter Robert Towne.  After all, he wrote the script for ""Chinatown"".  Instead Towne steals elements from ""Goldeneye"" and ""North by Northwest"", only without the cleverness of those two films.  (How's that for a recommendation: not as clever as a non-Connery Bond film.)There are good points, of course.  The film does have all the trademark Woo flourishes, and it has the coolest motorcycle chase/duel ever caught on celluloid.  But the computer special effects looked fake and Woo seems out of his element in the wide open spaces of Australia (As you should be aware, Woo does his best work in dense urban spaces and without digital gimmickry). Plus, to my horror, the editing is patchy--the greatest sin a fast-paced action flick can commit.Fans of Cruise and the M:I franchise will like this film.  As for me, although I was somewhat entertained, I found this film a slight disappointment.  I rated it a 6 out of 10.",Mission - Impossible II
203,moviemattb,"Fun action movie, but not a good Mission: Impossible movie",7,30 August 2015,"Now after reviewing the first movie, this time, we accelerate to a sequel that many critics and fans considered this to be the weakest film of the series. However, is it the worst? Here it goes: Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt goes on a mission to Sydney, Australia alongside with his IMF team as they go after a deadly virus to be destroy. Also, keeping a lookout on a thief, who happens to be in a relationship with our main villain Sean Ambrose. That doesn't sound much like a plot, don't you think? I guess that's all up to you. The plot I will admit isn't as interesting as the plot from the first one as that one was trying to be more of a mystery movie. This one, however, its just pretty much a simplistic plot with plenty of action. I don't mind plots being simple, but it would've been something if it has a plot that is actually more interesting. Aside the plot for being weak, the plane from the opening scene of the movie is purely CG, and it really doesn't look good at all; at least the bird went through a fire (also CG that appears toward the end) doesn't look as bad as the plane. Thandie Newton does an OK job for her performance, but her character isn't as compelling as any other female leads that I've seen in movies. So those were the issues, but is there anything good? Yes, there is. I thought Tom Cruise does a great job for reprising his role, and really is good for doing his own stunts. I love how he was introduce, during the opening scene where he is rock climbing. Also, him rock climbing is all done for real. Kudos to Cruise and the filmmakers for filming that scene for real instead of filming it on a set. Dougray Scott does a fine job for playing a villain, but don't find him to be complex enough. Nevertheless, I have fun watching him. The rest all did fine. John Woo's direction is actually not that bad at all. He does a fantastic job on the action scenes, and also knowing where to point the camera at. Moreover, on the action scenes, they're exciting to watch and really love the final confrontation between Ethan Hunt and Sean Ambrose. Hans Zimmer's music is very different than Danny Elfman's, but I love his arrangement on the theme song and how he provides his own take of the music for the movie. When I hear the guitar riffs, I just go flat out crazy because it makes you want to rock out. I love the look of Australia as it was being filmed. Also, never I find this to be boring. Sure the plot is weak, but I can just put this movie in and enjoy it for its mindless entertainment. All in all, its a John Woo movie and he has own unique style on making this movie. It may be the weakest film of the series, but I don't think its actually the worst that I've ever seen. Overall, ""Mission: Impossible II"" is a fun action movie, but not a good ""Mission: Impossible"" movie. I give it a 7 out of 10.",Mission - Impossible II
204,tomrito,Good action movie,6,27 May 2000,"About all I can say is that this was a very good visual film.  Thanks to Mr. Woo, the action was first rate and the movie had the look and feel of a Bond film.  However, I would have liked a little more in the way of a real thinking mission impossible. But all we get is, hope he kills the germs before the yellow dots get to the red dots, or something to that effect. Nothing new and nothing much to think about, just good looking people in good action shots.  This makes for a fun night out but left me feeling like the spy left out in the cold looking for more substance.",Mission - Impossible II
205,Ace-38,A movie finally worth its predetermined blockbuster status.,7,21 June 2000,"""Mission: Impossible 2"" is one of the few movies that has the oomph to live up to its hype.  John Woo has created a visual spectacle, and the story is just passable enough to maintain interest.Plotline?  Fairly simple....Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is called back into service after a rogue agent steals the antidote to a lethal new manmade virus.  With the antidote the villain (Dougray Scott) can attain the virus and wreak havoc on the population.I really want to praise John Woo, he has such a deft touch with action movies and the ones in this are no exception.  Fight scenes, chase scenes all so expertly choreographed that it seems like a ballet.  Top notch action sequences in this one that may only be rivaled this year by ""X-Men"".Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt,and is a engaging presence onscreen.  His chemistry with Thandie Newton (as Nyah, a very beautiful and clever thief) is top notch.  Wonderful characterization here, as Ethan never comes off too serious or too campy, but as a man trying to get the job done.Thandie Newton plays Nyah Nordolf-Hall, a civilian thief recruited by the IMF to help Hunt get to the villian (more on him later) because of a past connection.  I havent seen any of Ms. Newton's earlier work, but may have to go back and see them.  She comes off as a classic elegant beauty, but her character gets little more than the ""love interest"" treatment.  She manages well though, and holds her own against Cruise.Dougray Scott as the rogue IMF agent Sean Ambrose.  His deceptive and murderous ways have caused him to turn against those he used to defend and now he is in control of one of the most lethal viruses known to man.  And only he has the cure.  A very well played baddie by Scott, and he even steals a couple of scenes out from under Cruise.  First time I've seen him as well, but really cant wait to again.Supporting cast is little more than window dressing, although Ving Rhames (Luther Stickell) is more interesting than the rest.  Cracks a couple pretty good jokes too.""Mission: Impossible 2"" is everything the first should have been, action packed, entertaining, and enjoyable.  John Woo may very well have saved this franchise for Paramount, and should pass tips on how to properly make an action film to the next ""Mission"" director.4 out of 5",Mission - Impossible II
206,pzanardo,Mission unplausible,5,18 December 2001,"The problem with ""Mission Impossible 2"" is not that the movie is absurd. The trouble is that it is unplausible. We may accept with fun the supernatural acrobacies and the preposterous technology, as we are used to do in 007 movies.But the main flaw, the unlikely behavior of the guys on the screen, cannot be swallowed. I mean: along the movie, the good guys has several opportunities to kill the bad guys, and very easily, too. Why they don't just do that? Moral scruples of the good ones? When the villains are threatening the survival of the whole human species? Come on! Dead men don't harm: any spy (or what else Ethan is) should fruitfully apply this axiom.Personally, I was also annoyed by the so politically correct choice of the main bad guy and bad institution: a former CIA agent and a pharmaceutical company, respectively.A little appeal: John Woo is very often called the new Sam Peckinpah. Please, don't say that! Please!""Mission Impossible 2"" has some merits. The cinematography is magnificent.The movie is (moderately) entertaining. Tom Cruise is nice and acts adequately (but, since he's a beautiful man, he is commonly considered a bad actor: a little unfair cliche). Thandie Newton is gorgeous, really a splendid girl endowed with an out-of-standard beauty. The action scenes and special effects are very well made, although excessive and over-done. You know: for kids...",Mission - Impossible II
207,bluepink,"A nice enjoyable movie, straightforward plot",5,31 August 2020,"I really liked the plot, it was simple yet effective & it was also interesting. I also liked the main characters i.e. Tom, Thandie & the antagonist.There were some scenes that didn't really make sense e.g. the car scene near the beginning with Tom & Thandie. Just why? But I think this is generally a light-hearted movie, so I can overlook those unrealistic aspects.Also, the movie started to drag towards the end. Perhaps because everything was starting to become predictable, and we knew that Tom would get away & save the girl. On that basis - I think that towards the end, there should have been more high stakes involved (or perhaps another twist) to keep us engaged.But overall it was enjoyable.",Mission - Impossible II
208,Mulliga,WHERE'S THE ACTION?,1,15 January 2002,"Don't believe the junk other people say about this one.The great, action-packed previews and the coolness of John Woo practically made me buy a ticket. I came into the theater expecting slam-bang action on par with ""The Killer"" and ""A Better Tomorrow."" Instead, I got a lot of fluff best saved for a cheesy Meg Ryan romantic comedy, and action at the level of ""The Replacement Killers"" (and less of it). Tom Cruise has longer hair but his character is inexplicably stupider. The whole script is predictable and lame, and even more far-fetched than the original (ANOTHER ""rogue agent""? With this many traitors, how does the IMF function?). The action scenes are good but painfully brief. They are also fairly derivative (Wow! A motorcycle chase! Two-fisted gunplay! Karate fighting!) The movie takes an hour just getting started. Very flat characters like Luther accentuate the fact that this is Cruise's movie.See some of John Woo's other films, see Sam Peckinpah, see ""True Lies""...Just avoid this movie.",Mission - Impossible II
209,Embley,What a drag,2,26 May 2000,"No chemistry, no plot, no excitement, no connection to the characters. Boring.  And cheesy.  Yuck.  Tom Cruise was about the only decent thing in this mediocre film but even he could not make it worth the price you have to pay these days to see a first run movie.  What is it with John Woo?  I really liked his Chow Yun Fat films but ever since he started doing american films he sucks..  It's really sad.",Mission - Impossible II
210,Keyser Soze-12,"A stupid action movie, not much more",6,23 October 2000,"It is important to understand that this is not a sequel to MI1.  Mission Impossible 1 was a slick, intelligent, spy movie.  MI2 is not.  To compare the two movies is like comparing James Bond to Ronin.  The only similarity is that Tom Cruise plays a character with the same name from the first movie, IT IS NOT THE SAME CHARACTER!First off, the difference in the movies are much like Tom Cruise's hair.  In the first movie, Tom's hair was short and very military like.  That's what the first movie was.  It was serious and centered less on action.  Tom's hair in the second movie is long and very California-ish.  So is the movie. It loses the military seriousness and trades it for action.  Tom Cruises character has also changed drastically.  He is now longer serious, but quite the opposite.  He is always smiling and happy.  ALWAYS!
Now, I don't think that is a bad thing.  I liked this movie.  The action sequences are amazing, and with leave you breath less.  However, being a fan of the first film, I didn't like it as much.  Most people didn't like the first film because they couldn't understand it, Keyser Soze syndrome it's called.  So, if you didn't get the first film, you will like this movie.However, if you enjoyed the first film and expected a real sequel, go rent Ronin.",Mission - Impossible II
211,CherryBlossomBoy,Is this supposed to be a joke?,1,27 April 2011,"Let's assume for a second that this was a parody. I had a few hard laughs watching this. John Woo is a king of parodies. He replaced Zucker brothers on the throne.Unfortunately, it seems that Mission Impossible II is quite a serious sequel to Mission Impossible. And I must call it what it is - John Woo is king of crap.First, the sequences take forever to execute - the guy is obsessed with slow motion. Then all at once the editing gets epilepsy inducing - way too fast and too disconnected for a viewer to realize what's going on. Too many closeups make you uncertain who is who. I've watched a ""making of"" where Woo's multiple camera setup was praised as ingenious... He shot Tom Cruise jumping onto a bridge on a motorcycle with more than ten cameras running simultaneously. It's not ingenious, it only shows that the guy is clueless about what he wants out of the shot. In that shot it took Cruise's character minutes to cover the jump that in reality takes three seconds. There were slow motions, there were repetitions from another angle and there was me yawning and pondering whether it's time to change the channel. And it goes like this through the entire feature. Be it a car chase or an indoor shootout or a beach hand-to-hand combat, it's always the same. A directing mess where a brilliant child of Hong Kong cinematography follows a simple rule: when you don't know what to put in - put everything in.Woo also possesses no sense whatsoever when the line is crossed between outrageous and silly. Mission Impossible franchise is certainly not about realism. Alright, but Brian De Palma in first MI and J.J.Abrams in third knew how to handle the sensationalistic nature of the story and action. Woo lacks the sensibility. It must be a cultural thing. Maybe in China they see this as a serious work of art. I'd feel embarrassed just to try to put into words what Woo had the gall to put on screen.I don't know how or why people take this guy seriously and how he keeps landing jobs in Hollywood. I mean it was obvious from ""Broken Arrow"" that the guy is a charlatan. So keep praising this ""master of disaster"", he's fooling all of you. He doesn't care about his movies. Obviously, because he puts very little thought in them.",Mission - Impossible II

This makes you yawn but then like a bucket of fresh water action splashes you right into a sleepy face. The music by Hans Zimmer is shining at the top of my list with its intensity and epic motives. Thanks to the works of the master the watching ramps up a notch.Together with Tom Cruise we can follow the steps of Thandie Newton that crawls into the skin of a thief like a pick into a lock. Ving Rhames keeps pleasing your eyes with funny remarks and impressive skills. The villains by Dougray Scott and Richard Roxburgh make a nice pair of bad guys showing some solid wicked master plan knitting.Waiting for next mission to be accepted I would say that nevertheless the second part might seem worse but the various innovations and obvious diligence were not in vain.

213,smashattack,Is this Mission: Impossible or James Bond?,5,3 July 2002,"Spoilers.We see a car scene, not unlike James Bond's GoldenEye scene, then an... ""intimate"" scene shortly thereafter, not unlike any James Bond movie.  Not to mention the fact that this movie tries way too hard to be cool, rather than focusing on the plot and character development.First off, Tom Cruise looks awful with long hair.  I'm sorry, but that just doesn't look like the Ethan Hunt I remember.  Heck, Ethan Hunt is a totally different character in this one.  In the first Mission:  Impossible, Hunt was serious about his job and focused only on that.  Now he's a woman-chasing, long-haired, cool guy who flashes a smile every thirty seconds or so.The plot is actually as intricate as the first Mission:  Impossible.  I realized this when I saw the movie for the third time and really understood it all.  It's not explained quite as well.Now that I think about it, though, this movie seems like it has nothing to do with Mission:  Impossible.  It's reverted to sex, loud guitar and crummy flamenco themes, Hunt has completely changed, and there are so many boring sequences with Ethan and Nyah that left me very angry.The music is absolutely awful.  With the exception of four tracks on the CD (which are in the movie), the rest are soft, annoying flamenco guitar strings which all sound the same.  It really makes me angry how the series went from a nice beat with great drums and action music to this junk.  The main theme isn't even really the same.  It's been changed into a screaming guitar.  It does, however, sound awesome on the track called ""Bare Island"", when Ethan has presumably been killed but instead runs out and pulls off his mask.M:I-2 is a completely separate story from its predecessor, which makes it that much more disappointing.  I saw this movie in theaters expecting the impossible again, but instead found an overly ""cool"" flick with too much violence.  Unlike the first, ""Zero body count!"", Hunt actually resorts to killing a bunch of innocent security guards in the laboratory.All in all, M:I-2 is a major disappointment and I would not suggest seeing it unless you are a big fan of Mission:  Impossible.  Let's hope the third installment actually remembers that there were two before it.  Hunt doesn't even seem to remember his whole experience with the NOC List... and Kittridge, who played a huge part before, no longer exists.Like I said, disappointing.",Mission - Impossible II

Next time I ride my moped I'll hop off and slide down the street alongside of it wearing my jandals while shooting a pea shooter at bulls eye targets on passing lamposts.Tom fighting??? He may be able to act, but he simply can't fight. His martial arts looked like the way I would do martial arts. And I'm fairly hopeless! To make this even worse (or funnier!) they show Tom's fights in slow-mo!

Other then that, I can't see why this movie would have even been considered by the studio that gave its money for this over the top and overblown experience.I am sorry; John Woo should not direct such things as this. Everything from the camera direction, dialogue, and especially the stunts ranked on a level that would see in a B rated moving trying to be something more then it actually was.

The critics dying to find another blame, and the fans dying to know what will it come to another Mission Impossible movie. In brief, we can see John Woo domination here. More than just simplified storyline, also the usual Woo-ish photographic style (slow motion, lots of stills and stare), musical style (which destroys Hans Zimmer's musical talents), and intense-detailed action sequences. Congratulations! From a highly-strategic and tactical Television Series, to a highly self-motivated and one-man-secret mission, this last movie eventually changed into a full actions movie. Just that. There might be some contents exchange here. You can see the more and less lists below: Compared with the first one, you get: More emotional and love scenes More detailed actions and physical fights Tom Cruise exposed! Both body, face, and charismatic style, including awesome acrobatic style and Kung Fu moves (lets make a duel against Keanu Reeves) More sophisticated gadgets More face-offs And less: Less intelligent plots and smart strategies One man mission. This time he shares A BIT with his colleagues Less Mission: Impossible mysteries. This movie is predictable and simple And still: Focused on Ethan Hunt's personal judgements and revenge Left the other IMF agents backed him up with full supports (regardless his emotional interference) In the end, you find yourself looking at an action movie (much better than the last James Bond movie), entitled Mission: Impossible. Wrapped in world-class intelligent, but filled only with first-class actions. The biggest lost might be from the musical score. There's too many new standard applied here, including the opening scene. And the original-heart stamping mission theme song is cut off, and changed into a new rocking theme. For many Tom Cruise or action movies fans, this movie proves to be satisfying. But if you are an original Mission: Impossible fans, you will be disappointed.

But this movie is the only one that feels like it's made for children and not adults. It is that bad. In this M.I. movie and only in this M.I. movie Hunt for some reason has a problem with killing people. Which means he acts out of character, compared to every other M.I. movie. Also, when people are shot, it's almost always happening off camera. Which is annoying as hell and reminds me of the awful fourth Indiana Jones movie. If the rating don't allow you to show people being shot, complete with bulletholes and blood, then don't have people being shot in your goddamn movie. I really hate the MPAA. They have ruined, what could have been so many good movies with their cencorship. Nyah is unattractive and too skinny and annoying. And the signifigant height differrence between Tom Cruise and Dougray Scott, makes it laughable that Scotts character can impersonate Cruises character just by wearing the famous masks and nobody can tell the difference, between the two.The plot is a joke. And besides from the last half hour of non stop action, this movie does not deserve to be a part of the M.I. franchise. And enough with the goddamn doughs.

225,andrewmerritt-31652,Guilty pleasure of the Mission Impossible franchise,7,7 January 2019,"Mission Impossible II is the sequel to Mission Impossible and stars Tom Cruise reprising his role as Ethan Hunt. In this mission Ethan Hunt has to retrieve a deadly virus before a rouge IMF (Impossible Missions Force) agent sells it to the highest bidder. Before Mission Impossible II, Brian De Palma directed the first one, but then he left and gave the reigns to John Woo, who's best known for directing movies like Face Off or Broken Arrow. Also added to the mix is a soundtrack provided by Limp Bizkit, who provides the theme song to Mission Impossible and Metallica. So having John Woo as the director plus music provided by Limp Bizkit and Metallica, I think its safe to say that this Mission Impossible will have no ties to the show or the first one. And also increase the action and focus little on the spying. And what we have here now is an action packed punk, rock n' roll Mission Impossible that has very little to with spy and more with action. Even though John Woo is the director I cant help but feel that someone else directed the first hour of Mission Impossible II as we have this weird love triangle between Tom Cruise, Thandie Newton, and Dougray Scott. I didn't care one bit for this weird love triangle, I wanted to see action, explosions, and doves, which is what John Woo is known for in most of his movies. Also having Dougray Scott as the villain was miscast as he did not once show any signs of fear, or intimidation, but I found him very annoying and irritating that it was wasted potential. The main problem I have with this is the script as it feels so lazy and rushed that the script writers couldn't be bothered with editing or coming up with crafty dialogue. And it's all over the place, as it gives no explanation how this is connected with this. But thankfully John Woo and composer Hans Zimmer jump in at the last hour and gives us what we came here to really see and give us goose bumps. So in the end, I wouldn't say that this a bad movie, but I would call it a guilty pleasure of the Mission Impossible franchise. But it would've been better if everyone including the studio pitched in and balanced the spy and the action.",Mission - Impossible II
226,darkjosh,"Explosions, Chase Scenes, Exotic Girl, Amounting to Nothing *sigh*",4,7 November 2000,"From the very start of M:I 2, it's very clear this is a John Woo movie. Movie, for film is not a proper word to describe this uninvolving, plodding, loud crash of cinematic debris.Not picking up where Mission Impossible left off, M:I 2 brings Tom Cruise back as IMF agent Ethan Hunt given an assignment by Anthony Hopkins (inexplicably placed in a small, perfunctory role) who must stop European baddie Dougray Scott and American CEO Brendan Gleeson from releasing a deadly virus.That's the extent of the story, and it's stretched out for an excruciating 2 hours of explosions, hilariously-bad dialogue, deadly-boring conversations, generic, one-dimensional characters, and of course, more explosions.  Tom Cruise's calculating, emotional Hunt has been replaced by an indestructible, slick, larger-than-life persona that in no way resembles the Ethan Hunt of the first film.  Before, he cared a great deal about his mission; now, he cares a great deal for danger and excitement, as clearly shown by the otherwise unnecessary, meant-to-blow-you-away rock climbing introduction.Not to say that John Woo isn't a gifted action director.  Face/Off is one of the most stunning, well-executed, fun action films ever done.  However, it doesn't take itself too seriously, as the performances from Cage and Travolta demonstrate by exuding devilish wit and mischief.  Mission Impossible 2, however, attempts to cover up its lack of story with seemingly intriguing scenes of a blood-letting virus (seen before in Outbreak and its countless ripoffs), exotic locales inhabited by criminals (scene in countless crime films), and of course, over-the-top action sequences which in themselves may be cool, but that's all they are.  They don't really help further the story, because by the middle of the film, the story has gotten as far as it will go.Screenwriter Robert Towne said his script was written according to action sequences dictated to him by director Woo, and it clearly shows. Mission:Impossible II is a collection of well-choreographed fight and grandiose action sequences, but that's it.  Paying no homage to either the intrigue, deception and constantly twisting episodes of the TV series or the first installment of the film series, Mission: Impossible II is a sequel reaching only for the green, assaulting viewers with image, hoping they will not notice its lack of substance.4 out of 10",Mission - Impossible II
227,saint405,From De Palma to Woo,6,14 June 2006,"Every director has his own sense of style. Brian De Palma is a Hitchcock stylist while John Woo is pure action. With the first Mission Impossible, De Palma made it slick and intelligent with a very in dept story line and crafty action. Woo on the other hand makes Mission Impossible 2 a low key love story filled with explosions and boring dialog. Woo diverts all our attention away from the previous M:I's feel into a whole new setting with a whole new tone. With Woo's non-stop rush of adrenaline, he turns Ethan Hunt from a cool super spy into a hardcore daredevil.Tom Cruise makes his return as Ethan Hunt, a spy who is on holiday climbing cliffs who happens to be called in on a very impossible mission. Seems as though a rogue IMF agent, played by Dougray Scott, has crashed a plane and kidnapped a top secret disease only known by it's name, Chemira. Hunt is assigned to enlist a jewel thief to help find out the agents plan. Along with Ethan comes his super hacker pal Luther Stickell, played ounce again by the brute of a man Ving Rhames. Together, Ethan must save the world and the girl who he has fallen in love with. Wait, a love story in a Mission Impossible movie? That's what Woo is giving us? John Woo is a good director, I'll give him that, but he should have left this movie alone. Brian De Palma had already set up a clever spy franchise and Woo took it down within the first ten minutes when we see Tom Cruise scaling a cliff like he's Spider-Man. Ethan is totally different here than in the previous movie, looking like a regular Steven Segal poser. The acting is worse than part 1, total boredom. Woo, instead of entertaining us, bores us to tears. And the villain is horrible. The plot is a deflated idea used over fifty times and yet Woo decides to pump it up with air again and use it. The special effects, alright. We get some good CGi here and there, and an excellent shot of an knife about to stab Tom's eyeball out, but sense it's six years later after this movie was released, it's old.The only real saving grace is the action. Woo throws in as many bullets and explosions as he can. We have a cool motorcycle chase, a glass room shattered to pieces with bullets, exploding sun glasses, and even a two man wrestling match atop a hill. Sadly, the action itself is either to slow or too fast and it looses it's willpower. The movie acts like a Dawsons Creek episode, a love triangle while death is involved. Sorry Mr. Woo but this movie was pretty bad. My advice to all the viewers out in the world, see Part 3. JJ Abrams made the best one, cooler then De Palma's and makes Woo's looks like trash. Mission Impossible 2 gets a 6 out of 10. C- on my grade.",Mission - Impossible II

This is a seriously misguided effort that tries to turn Tom Cruise into James Bond. It waste the usually scene-stealing talents of Ving Rhames. After seeing Dougray Scott seethe menacingly and ineffectively I'm glad he didn't get the Wolverine role in X-Men. Only Thandie Newton breathed any fire into her role as a sexy double-dealing agent. And of course even a subpar effort by director John Woo is always interesting. There is some terrific action here, but we've seen it all before. The movie rip-offs the astonishing Face/Off and he excellent The Matrix (which rip-offed Woo for great effects). It substituted loud music for real suspense and I'm getting sick of stop/quick/slow/jagged motion editing effects. But above I didn't care who lived or died and the story sucked. Of course I'm writing this with Titanic on the tube playing on HBO for the 1000th time. MI:2 is slightly better than Broken Arrow.",Mission - Impossible II

231,AmyJenson1995,More entertaining but less captivating,6,10 September 2015,"As this movie is a sequel, it would be very hard to not succumb to the temptation of comparing MI2 with the first installment of the series. Personally thinking, I much prefer the first one which was deep and kept me in throughout the story. This one is more raw and gives much less space to brains.The biggest fault is the plot which is as most basic as we can get. This is all about stunts and shooting. While it's beautifully shot with slow motions and fireworks, leave your brain home because the storyline is inexistent and we already know who are the good and bad guys since the very first scene of the movie. Brian De Palma had the good taste of keeping the suspense to the very end, revealing who was the real bad guys at the very last scenes. But here there is no suspense. We all know how this gonna end. This is a John Woo movie and Brain movies are not really his style. This cost him the 4 points.But Mr Woo is also an expert on action staging and this is what saved this movie. The action scenes are beautifully shot, a lot of them in slow motion which is one of the pillars of John Woo style. Those make the movie quite enjoyable to see. The pace is high and keeps us entertained. The locations are breathtaking (Grand Canyon, Sevilla and Australia). With John Woo, everything is focused on the visual and MI2 is not an exception to this rule. The casting performance is not that bad either even if Ethan Hunt lost a lot of personality between the two movies.So here it is. I give it a 6 out of 10 which is not a bad mark but not an excellent one either. I would have wished this movie to be smarter but John Woo sacrificed it for fun which is not a bad idea if you want to enjoy a nice moment at the theater but is if you wish your movie to be remembered.",Mission - Impossible II

This films clearly establishes John Woo as the premiere action film director today. Add this to a list of amazing films that include The Killer, Hard Boiled and Face/Off. I loved the first film for it being a different kind of spy film. It's an adventure-thriller that is pointed more toward the spy world than the action world. Any one who liked the MI will love this. At first I didn't believe that Tom Cruise could pull off the action hero but he total flipped me for a loop. By the end of the film I was like ""Yeah Tom!"" It without a doubt gets a 9.57 in my book. The 2nd best film of the summer behind Shaft. If you haven't seen it yet, what are you doing reading this, get out of your chair and catch this film.

234,Beard_Of_Serpico,Not the best in the series but still a decent spy/action movie.,6,13 April 2020,"I love the Mission Impossible series and MI2 is probably the weakest one but i don't think that makes it a bad movie.
it's directed by John Woo who is a master of action cinema. Watch Hard Boiled, The Killer, Bullet in the head and Face Off to see his over the top, balls to the wall action movies. I just don't think his style really works in an American spy thriller as the slower more dialogue heavy moments are full of exposition and cartoonish moments. John Woo's movies are more theatrical in tone and it doesn't really work here, it comes off as a bit silly.
There had to be some kind of studio meddling because you can tell the violence was toned down in editing as well. It's rated a 15 in the UK but i reckon it's more like a 12A.
Even so i still enjoy this movie for what it is, there's strong performances by everyone, lots of cool high tech spy gadgets, decent action with some awesome stunts and you can see the start of Tom Cruise taking risks to make these movies as he performs a lot of the bike stunts and kung fu himself(As far as i can tell). There's also a pretty breathtaking rock climbing scene at the beginning of the movie.The series really took off from Mission Impossible 3 onwards but this is still a fun action thriller, not brilliant but i have seen MUCH worse movies which other people claim to love and praise.",Mission - Impossible II
235,tml_pohlak_13,Mission: Impossible Stunts 2,3,12 March 2009,"Mission: Impossible 2 is loaded with stunts. From the very first sequence, this movie is jam-packed with action and gravity-defying stunts. Too much for its own good, as a matter of fact.First of all, let's start with the simple fact that Tom Cruise cannot act that well. He's decent, but never convincing in his role. His romantic interest, played by Thandie Newton, was absolutely horribly cast! I've never heard such unnaturally stressed sentences before! The only bright spot in the entire cast is Dougray Scott as the villain. The rest of the cast is either flat-out terrible or just mediocre.Now the plot: it was O.K. Trouble is, it called for one trick far too often. Countless times during the film, someone puts on a flesh mask and with an electronic device alter their voices, and pass themselves off as someone else. Now, the first time this was done, it was flat-out great! But by the time people began impersonating dead people, it got far too predictable and asinine.John Woo's direction? He focused mainly on the stunts, which I have to admit, were pretty good. But he's no ""acclaimed action director"" like it says on the back of the DVD box. He's a second unit who got lucky!Yes, I was fooled by the nice DVD box that this was a movie worth buying. I hope no one else makes the same mistake.",Mission - Impossible II

How they do all that is amazing. Combinations of Matrix and other movies.  All done to perfection and Edited with crisp style and smooth too.  John Woo at his best.Not a very new story but some new twists on how Bio-engineering and Germ Warfare could lead to.  Tom was great and everyone else played their parts very well too.

The first film was a tight, smooth thriller that barreled along at warp speed, and was a nice break from conventional Hollywood action thrillers. 'II' pretty much IS a conventional Hollywood thriller.Almost nothing from the first film has been picked up here: Tom Cruise? Yes, he's back, but he's not a spy anymore. He's James Bond, minus ANY cool gadgets or charisma. The awesome theme music? Gone, replaced with a horrible rock score. The action is typical Hollywood: Slow-motion gunplay and martial arts.Ugh, I hate this movie! The acting and dialogue is lame, the techno-rock score even lamer, and the action scenes are mundane. Here's hoping 'MI: III' won't be as cringe-inducing as this disaster.",Mission - Impossible II

Sure, the action scenes are great in that classic John Woo, ultra-choreographed way, but the plot isn't original or have much to it.  Dougray Scott tries as the villain, but he's not scary at all, just sort of mildly irritable.  After all, this is a villain who demands stock options as part of his bounty. (Truly, a sign of the times, and the audience laughed at that one.) Thandie Newton, who I had never seen before, is certainly beautiful, but she carries two expressions on her face through the entire movie, and resembles Ally McBeal in a tighter T-shirt. And then there's Tom.  His character is more of a James Bond clone than the character is the original movie; I admire his guts and fearlessness for doing several scenes (especially the opening one), and the truth is, he's not bad.

It starts off rather intriguing, then just nose dives into something that seems to have nothing to do with an action film. If you enjoy watching some woman standing around trying to look sultry and sexy ad nauseam, then this is the movie for you. I have never seen Thandie Newton (the woman) before or since, so I'm not sure if it was bad acting or bad direction, but she was awful. I kept waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and...waiting, for something interesting to happen, while cringing at the pathetic dialog. Halfway through, there was no action (unless you count the ridiculously stupid and pointless car race between Thandie and Tom). The whole movie was a waste of time; unless you enjoy seeing Thandie and Tom endlessly gazing at each other like love-struck teenagers, while not really DOING anything. It was endless talk and no action, until the end, where we suddenly have a plethora of unbelievable action, that is so over the top impossible, it isn't even enjoyable. I just kept shaking my head. The whole motorcycle fight on the beach was so cheesy I actually burst out laughing. And for God's sake, quit using slow motion for everything! It makes it all worse. I was honestly hoping Thandie was going to jump off that cliff, mostly so that horrible music would stop. Someone must have black-mailed Anthony Hopkins to be in this movie.",Mission - Impossible II

Still this movie is great fun and better than the origonal. I liked that I could actually understand the plot unlike the the first MI and it was interesting. Okay so they over do the face mask thing and it's somewhat implausable. This movie was done by Jon Woo, who did Face/Off among other good action movies and he doesn't fail here. The ending action sequence in this movie is right up there with the ending in the origonal MI as one of the greatest action scenes ever in a movie. This is not a great action movie but it's a good one with enough in it to make it satisfying. I give this movie a 7 out of 10.",Mission - Impossible II
243,jiangliqings,Pulse-pounding action entertainment.,10,10 December 2000,"*** 1/2 stars out of ****Mission: Impossible 2 is a rare sequel that surpasses the original, which was a bit too complex for its own good.  This time around, with director John Woo at the helm, Tom Cruise back, and Robert Towne writing the script, the sequel is considerably easier to understand in terms of story, and the action scenes are some of the wildest and best in years.The story doesn't really matter that much in a film like this.  It's basically James Bond over again, this time with Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) out to stop former IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) and his henchmen from stealing Chimera, a deadly man-made virus that kills in less than 2 days. To penetrate Ambrose's security, Hunt hesitantly brings in thief Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton) to work her charms over Ambrose; she was also his former lover.But not everything goes according to plan, and Ambrose discovers Nyah's real purposes for coming back to him and plans to kill her, but she injects herself with the last strain of the virus.  With 20 hours left, Hunt must retrieve Bellerophon, the virus's only cure, and stop Ambrose from delivering the virus over the world.M:I2 is entirely different in style from its predecessor.  It works as pure action entertainment, and it's all the better for it.  Though it doesn't bring in fight after fight from the beginning, it's never dull, with charismatic performances, great direction as usual from John Woo, and some lovely cinematography.Woo's usual over-the-top style is here, with a little more restraint in terms of blood and gore, but there's no mistaking his touch in the film. His trademarks are here, and as strong as ever.  This film is easily better than the last several Bond movies.  After an entertaining set up, the last 40 minutes are packed with non-stop action, with Woo turning in amazing set piece after set piece.  Whether it's a chaotic shootout in a secret lab, a long motorcycle chase that features a barage of breathtaking stunts (one of Woo's all-time best action scenes, a real compliment), or a climactic martial arts duel on a beach, the last 1/3 of the film don't disappoint if its action you're looking for.The performances are solid for a film of this genre.  Tom Cruise simply exudes coolness as superspy Ethan Hunt, who is truly becoming an even more compelling hero than James Bond.  Thandie Newton is relatively decent as the love interest, though she's a little nonexistent in the last half hour due to the non-stop action.  Ving Rhames gets some good lines in, providing comic relief along with some action muscle.  Dougray Scott is all right as the villain.  We don't really hate him as much as we should, but he does the physical parts of the role quite well.There are a lot of other little elements that work in M:I2.  Hans Zimmer composes another strong score, which reminds a tad of his own work in Gladiator.  The special effects are brilliantly done, the settings are exotic, and everybody involved seems to be enjoying themselves. A can't miss film if you love action.",Mission - Impossible II
244,Denver53,"Too much style (and slo mo!), not enough substance",5,19 June 2000,"I dare anyone out there to watch this film and count how many times director John Woo uses slow motion. About 20 minutes into the movie I was gripping my seat armrests in frustration, muttering under my breath, ""GET. ON. WITH. THE. SCENE!"" It is rare that I notice consciously any particular technique used by a filmaker, but in this case I felt like I was being smacked over the head with a scene from ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" over and over and over.Unlike at least one reviewer, I was very impressed with the female lead and her character. Sure, she was predictable, but I did not see her so much as a damsel in distress as I saw her as a woman who knew when to play it cool and when to take action. Tom Cruise was, well, Tom Cruise.
The plot? I read in an article a comment from Cruise that this movie concentrates more on Ethan Hawk's feelings and humanity than the convoluted (yet somehow entertaining because of its nearly unfathomable plot) MI: 1. Yes, it does do that. But it makes for a cliched, lurching plot, rather than an intriguing one. We are supposed to believe that Hawk, the consummate professional, falls in love with a woman because she drives almost as well as he does? Because she is a hottie? Because she has the nerve to be a thief? If Hawk did that, he would have been killed by some female spy or other by now. We needed something special, something unique, that pulled Hawk to the thief. But we never get it.The rest of the movie depends on his feelings for her. And it is hard to tell whether his crush makes him a better or worse spy. But we go along as lots of things blow up real good.I suppose in the end, what most bothered me about MI:2 was the boring plot. I expected more from a movie with the reputation of Mission Impossible. Instead, it seemed dumbed down in favor of style. I know, maybe Americans want that today. I guess I'm an exception. I gave MI:2 a 5.",Mission - Impossible II

246,TimBoHannon,John Woo puts Mission Impossible into nosedive,2,18 August 2003,"One term that we critics like to throw around is ""Train wreck of an action film."" It would be nice to deploy such a phrase in this review, but that would not be fair. A more appropriate term would be ""Plane crash,"" or perhaps ""65 car pileup."" This is eye candy for the blind. The plot is so confusing that after three viewings I now realize that it made no sense in the first place. The first movie also had an impenetrable plot, but at least I could piece it together by forming my own explanations where it had none. With this, I have to form explanations for my explanation and theories for my theories. On my third viewing, I predicted, with near infallibility, what the next scene was and what dialogue was to take place. Yet I still could not come up with sound fill-in for a plot which sports more holes than Swiss cheese.Just how was this allowed to happen with such an anticipated blockbuster? Is it not logical for the studios to be extra careful that these projects are done right? If that was what they wanted, then they sure picked the wrong director.That man was John Woo, who in this case demanded that the script to be written around action scenes he wanted to film. The result was a herky-jerky final cut that ran a ludicrous 3 1/2 hours, which left the good folks at Paramount Pictures with two uninviting options. They demanded drastic cuts, the surest way of wrecking a film. Still, it was better than shelving the project completely.The plot of the movie is...why bother? Tom Cruise plays the good guy, Dougray Scott plays the bad guy, Thandie Newton plays a romantic interest to the good guy, and Richard Roxburgh plays the world's toughest twit. Scott wants to acquire a bio-weapon for evil, and Cruise wants to use it for good. The battleground is Sydney, Australia.Beyond the plot exists the action and the acting, both of which were deprived of the quality they deserved.Acting: No cast will look good when John Woo is the director. He carries his films with artsy direction and a martial arts overdose. From an acting standpoint, his directing is pathetic. Tom Cruise may be a convincing actor in his other works, but not here, thanks to Mr. Woo. Thandie Newton's character is lacking greatly, but it would probably be a sin to condemn her acting skills based on this role alone. She does have a dazzling face, though.The only person who seems immune to the Woo curse is Dougray Scott, who plays one of the most ridiculous characters in the history of the motion picture. There is no doubt that his character is evil, but he is so overboard it is almost laughable. There is one boneheaded scene where he severely cuts the finger of his ""best friend"" and most trusted ally. I am yet to figure a good reason for him to do that. The movie does not seem to notice, as the next day his friend is back on the job, loyal as ever.Action: For this, Woo uses slow motion more than real time. Not only is this incongruous, but it interrupts and destroys otherwise good action. Not that it matters, since few people really care by the time Good Guy and Bad Guy are at each other's throats. I almost feel bad, now, for ripping ""Charlie's Angels,"" in my review.  At least that was harmless fun. Between this and ""The Avengers,"" I have seen nearly every rule of good filmmaking violated before my eyes.Sidenote: I am actually looking forward to the sequel, seeing that Joe Carnahan will direct. Hopefully he will take note of what went wrong with the first two, make the necessary corrections, and make a solid film that we fans can enjoy.",Mission - Impossible II
247,treeskier802,Action Packed Spy Thriller,9,15 June 2007,"This comment is being written on my 4th viewing of Mission Impossible II. As a fan of the spy genre, I must say that this film is a very good one. It is packed with Director John Woo's signature action sequences and is lead by a good performance from Tom Cruise.Say what you will about Cruise's off-screen antics, the guy packs a punch as CIA operative Ethan Hunt. The Mission Impossible trilogy is one of the best series in the spy genre.The first time I watched this film, I was amazed by Woo's awesome action direction and the hard rocking music score by Hans Zimmer. The second time I watched this movie, I was more critical of the plot, which seemingly had a few holes. On my subsequent viewings, however, I think the plot is sound, it just takes a few times watching the movie to understand it completely. Most of the Mission Impossible films have complex story lines; MI2 is no exception.At some point, I hope this movie is released as an unedited DVD so that the film's original 3 and 1/2 hour running could be viewed as an option to the theatrical release. As I understand it, many plot holes are filled with the longer version.If you don't mind complex thrillers and you enjoy heavy action, then this movie is for you. If you are not a Tom Cruise fan, probably won't like this film since he pays homage to his past movies (the opening seen with the sunglasses sticks out). I give this movie a Rating of 9 stars out of 10...but keep in mind I enjoy Cruise as an actor and the spy genre is my favorite in film.",Mission - Impossible II
248,MadReviewer,"Good, But It's Watered-Down Woo",7,30 April 2001,"`Mission: Impossible 2', on the surface, is a very good  not great  action movie.  Yes, it's kind of formulaic, but truly original action films are hard to come by.  `M:I2' covers all its bases, keeps the plot holes to a minimum, and avoids using too many of the standard cliches that litter the action genre.  It's a popcorn movie, pure and simple, and in terms of pure entertainment, it delivers fairly well.I say that `on the surface' it's very good because . . . man, what a waste of director John Woo's talents.  This film had the potential to be absolutely mind-blowing in terms of action, effects, and fights, and instead, well, it's just good.  People unfamiliar with John Woo's Hong Kong films (`The Killer', `Hardboiled', `A Better Tomorrow', and so on) might think the action sequences of `M:I2' stand out as spectacular  and if they do, great, because then they're enjoying the flick  but for the most part, `M:I2' pales in comparison to Woo's Hong Kong films, despite `M:I2's bigger budget and stars.  (The only scenes that come close to Woo's best work are the opening rock-climbing sequence and a chase scene involving motorcycles.) Woo's Hollywood films never seem to hit the over-the-top intensity of his Hong Kong work; if the Hollywood brass is toning Woo down for a mainstream audience, they're making a huge mistake. The film is wall-to-wall action, and for the most part, it's darn good action, but good as it was, it could've been way, way better. The story's okay  it deals with the hunt for a stolen bio-toxin, but it's really just an excuse to string a whole bunch of cool stuff together.  Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt is fine, and he seems to have fun with the role, but he's not exactly an engaging action hero  he doesn't come close to Pierce Brosnan as James Bond, or, for that matter, Bruce Willis as John McClane. Ving Rhames' reprisal of his role as Hunt's partner Luther is quite welcome  he's excellent, as usual.  Dougray Scott is pretty good as villain Sean Ambrose, but the biggest waste is Thandie Newton as Nyah, who's given little to do but serve as eye candy.  Yes, Ms. Newton is quite beautiful, but the lady can actually act as well, so a role such as this is an utter waste of her talents.  Cruise (as producer) could've cast any one of a dozen Victoria's Secret models as Nyah and gotten the same results.Basically, `M:I2' is a fun film, definitely worth renting if you're a casual action movie fan.   If you're a die hard John Woo, fan, though, be prepared for some slight disappointment.  Grade: B",Mission - Impossible II

The IMF wants it to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. Evil doers want it just to make a buck. One of them owns the only company that makes the antidote and would like to see the virus ""accidentally"" released into the general public. Another wants it to simply sell it to the highest bidder.When the pandemic hit, this film immediately came to mind. If you're into conspiracy theories and you're thinking about which country has benefited most from this pandemic, you might want to check it out. If not, check it out anyway. Thandie Newton is hot in this movie.The general consensus is that MI:2 is the weakest of the franchise. But I wouldn't go so far as to say that after watching the recent forgettable MI films. I would put it somewhere in the middle. I know it's one of the weaker MI films, and yet, I keep coming back to it anyway. I wonder why. Actually, I know why. It's because of Thandie Newton. She's incredibly hot in it and she saves the movie. There is no other reason to watch it.Well, there's another reason. Hans Zimmer's score, although it doesn't really fit in an MI film, is pretty good. Of course he writes a few familiar themes but he does introduce a couple new catchy ones.Now the negatives. This doesn't feel like an MI film but more like a Tom Cruise movie. Gone or minimized are the rest of his team. It's all about Tom Cruise. Gone also is the original MI theme. It has a score that, while good on its own, seems out of place. Then there's the excessively long finale. It's tedious and doesn't make sense considering the relationship between Ethan Hunt and the villain. There is little relationship between them and thus not enough strong feelings are built to warrant an excessively long final confrontation. But Thandie Newton sure does look good.In summary, this film has become more interesting in light of our recent situation. But if you don't care about that, you might still enjoy it as I have because you get to gaze at Thandie Newton.",Mission - Impossible II

What in the hell happened to the cool Ethan Hunt we saw in the first film? In the original the character was a no-compromising, antiwomanizer. We see the sequel and what do they give us? A playboy. Geez, Thanks a bunch! Here lies the problem of M:I-2 (God, I love writing that).. this movie doesn't take itself seriously enough. Ok, the first film had a stick up it's a**, but quite frankly, that's what I wanted. A cool spy film. And that's certainly what it was.Also, you can fool yourself all you want, but John Woo is no Brian De Palma. Woo is known to audiences as an action maestro and De Palma still managed to pull of better suspense and action thrills. The bullettrain climax in the original is a hard scene to top. Mission: Impossible II is below average and it's best values lie in the performance of Hopkins' cameo and Newton's drop dead gorgeous looks.** / *****",Mission - Impossible II

We have Tom Cruise, sending out 'I am God' signals throughout the film. I can take it. Then we have John Woo's trademark slo-mo sequences, amazing stunts, and of course white doves! I can take it. We have a gorgeous leading lady - Thandie Newton, who captures Ethan Hunt's (Cruise) heart. I can take it. And not forgetting the wonderful Dougray Scott as the villain of the piece. I can take it.I can take it all. But the plot man, the plot is soooooooo pathetically doctored, it's a kind of a slap in the face. It's insulting! At least the first film made it's audience's think throughout. Who really suspected Jon Voight would be involved in the original? You can figure out the ending to this film in the opening 10 minutes!Mind you, after saying that, this film is VERY entertaining! (provided you leave approximately 90% of your brain outside as you watch it!) This is first and above all, a popcorn film. That's the simple solution. It's a summer blockbuster, and what better way to get bums on seats than to combine the star appeal of Cruise and the explosive set pieces and direction of Woo?! You have to admit, the combo worked!Watching this film though, I can't help but think about what Dougray Scott did to his career - he turned down the part of Wolverine in X-Men to do this film. Just makes you wonder, but that's a different story isn't it...?The final climactic scrap between the hero and the villain is well choreographed and for a minute, I thought that Scott's villain could win, but hey, ain't no-one gonna beat Cruise is there? Nope. Predictable?

MI2 doesn't muddle the plot with ridiculous one-liners or twenty year old love interests for the hero.

A good one at that but still a disappointment. I'm also not a very big fan of John Woo. Technically he's brilliant ofcourse but he doesn't know how to develop a story. Dialogue in his films is always sentimental and corny. The action-sequences are very fast-paced but too outrageous. All these slow-motion shots make the whole thing look like a circus-show. And where do all these doves keep coming from? Doves don't belong in bunkers! Woo is taking this whole dove-thing to far. Can't he be subtle for once?

258,ChrisTreborn,""" Original's Damaged Version """,1,11 March 2005,"I was almost blown away by watching Brian Da Palma's first Mission Impossible in 1996 only by it's story telling. When I knew there was a second story coming and this time from acclaimed director John Woo, I went Upside Down. But when I saw this anticipated sequel, all that expectations 'self destructed' in no seconds.First of all Cruise is a damaged Hollywood actor, bounded in his 'super stardom'. For keeping his melting stardom he produced this sequel by disfiguring the creativity of Mr.Woo, making him to do things Beyond the LINES.Mission Impossible 2 (Spoilers******) Sequel to the 1996 movie, this time IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) has been sent on a mission to retrieve and destroy the supply of a genetically created virus called 'Chimera'. For this he must trace down Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) by his ex-girl friend Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton). Things went wrong when an affair started to happen between Nyah and Hunt.Scripted by veteran Hollywood screenwriter Robert Towne for the story of Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga, this movie moves with Romance, Tensions, and Actions. The STORY got nothing to contribute to the movie 'cause much of the script was incorporated around action scenes that director John Woo envisioned.But his version was corrupted by TOM CRUISE's involvement, yes, Tom Cruise is the producer, so that means he must be portrayed as larger than God like character. Don't know What the hell Tom wanted from this movie. Cruise kept encouraging additional invention, wanting Woo to make things higher, wider, and faster. So we must see MI2 as an ACTION vehicle designed for Cruise, to his own specifications. Even after such draw backs John Woo managed to gave his best for this movie. His stylized camera works, slow motions, plus fast cutting chasing action scenes. Especially the pigeon flying over Ethan when he appears from the fire flames, dialogues like ""Just stay alive, I am not going to loose you"", and that watery slow motion jumps. No one can capture that poetic movements except Woo.Also the soul of the movie was created by Hans Zimmer. Not over than Danny Elfman's previous score, but it suits with the fast cutting tones. Hans Zimmer did a good job for providing a respected score with authentic flamenco styles with heavy metal action cues for this messy film.All in all it's a great movie if we can forget the previous one. Cruise sucked in every crucial points in the movie, in interviews he even claimed that he did all his stunts. Then what was stunt guys Keith Campbell and Ron Kauk doing in the mountains, why Jimmy N. Roberts and Matt Mingay credited for motor cycles stunt doubles? Mr. Super G*Y want to fool us.Only thing happened good in the movie was its production conflicts and delays. Because of that, Dougray Scott had to give up his upcoming movie X-Men. And that role went to Mr. Hugh Jackman. O my GOD! What would have happened if the movie finished at the correct schedule in Australia? Huh, a great loss for the Australians and rest of the world (Jackman was from Australia and I can't assume any one in the place of Logan, he is the perfect Wolverine for the X-Men movie) I give this movie 1 out of 10!M I :2 = A Good Wrong Movie.",Mission - Impossible II
259,Dark Eye,Utter crap!,1,22 March 2002,"John Woo proves to us again that once he doesn't have Chow Yun-Fat's deadly charisma at his side to save his ass, he is all hype and no go. We all know by now that John Woo's unabashed over-sentimentalist approach is enough to make some people puke, and this movie is no different. But that's just him, besides he does have an uncanny ability to choreograph graceful gunfights, so I'll leave him at that. The real problem however is that Tom Cruise is only an average actor (see him over-acting in Magnolia). Throughout the movie, I cannot identify his struggles against the ""bad guys"" no matter how much I want to, so therefore I fail to see the relevance of this movie. Whatever happened to the good old days when Bruce Willis captured the audience's sympathise in Die Hard? Anyhow being a big-budgeted movie, the stunt sequences just tries TOO hard to impress the audience, but again what does it have to do with anything? Its just eye-candy, and its not THAT great to begin with. So I sat there in the theatre, bored to tears, wishing that I didn't took a chance on this worthless flick.",Mission - Impossible II
260,SebMoz,Very agonizing to watch,3,25 November 2020,"The original Mission Impossible is one of the best action movies from the 90's in my opinion, and of course it deserved a sequel. Unfortunately though, this movie seems to forget everything that made the first one good, while not really adding anything useful in return. The plot is super basic and forgettable, and the pacing is actually garbage. I checked the watch about 20 times throughout the movie, which is mostly due to the fact that there are way too many scenes that doesn't seem to add anything to the experience, and thus just detracts from it. The characters were also butchered pretty hard. Ethan Hunt, who was a calculating and cunning agent in the first movie, is now a James Bond-ripoff with none of the charm that makes Bond enjoyable. The direction is also very ill-fitting, with tons of slowmo and way over-the-top action scenes, even if they are well staged. The only thing saving this movie from being a complete disaster is a few good action scenes and some really good stunts. Still, this is one of the worst sequels I've ever seen, it's inferiour to the original in every way and I doubt I will rewatch it in the future.",Mission - Impossible II

The only thing that makes me crosser than seeing this film is the fact that millions of people will damn well go and see it and make it a 'success'.  Well I say DON'T GO.

262,Steven Reynolds,"""You've gotta be kidding.""",5,2 June 2000,"This distressingly inept no-brainer is not only a bad sequel - it's a bad film in its own right.  The essential problem is a mismatch of talents. Robert Towne is a wonderful writer, and this ""Notorious"" knock-off might have worked in a different franchise, but as a ""Mission: Impossible"" scenario it's too dated, too simple and too slow.  Similarly, John Woo is master of a certain kind of action, and he shines momentarily in the few opportunities the script gives him, but for the rest of the time he's struggling.  The result is a film that's plain boring.  Ugly and boring. Hans Zimmer's rhythmic score is about the only thing to keep you interested. But even that fails in the tragic/romantic moments when Zimmer shamelessly rips-off his own work from ""Gladiator"" and thereby suddenly makes you realize how emotionally disengaging this film is by comparison.  For Australian audiences, ""M:I-2"" offers some particularly exquisite tortures: a great actor like Richard Roxburgh murdering a South-African (?) accent; well-known Sydney locations trying to pass for Seville; and the mind-boggling casting of John Polson which, in retrospect, is probably quite appropriate - the finished film has the amateurish look and feel of a mediocre entry for 'Tropfest'.  It gives us nothing we haven't seen before and considerably less than we deserve.  Doing a better job wouldn't have been impossible.  Not even difficult.  It just would've required better judgement.",Mission - Impossible II

John woo's famous elements such as flying birds,Mexican standoff,slow motions,mannered emotional moments,homosexual relations became boring and repetitious.This guy is a perfect choice for martial art and crime movies but not for High budget movies with mega stars. there is a lot of stupid action scenes and duel on motorcycles was worst of them.this is told that there was some action scenes in director's mind and then,they wrote dialogs and story for filling the empty parts and making second MI movie!!! this is a shame.

264,mercury-26,Tom Cruise: International Man Of Mystery,2,8 June 2000,"""Mission: Impossible 2"" is pretty much a hodge-podge of favorites from the action/adventure genre: A car chase down a winding, cliffside road; a surveillance scene at a race track; the action-hero-sent-to-recruit-beautiful-jewel-thief-but-falls-in-love-with-her -instead plotline; a plane crashing into a mountain; the manly action hero dangling from a cliff--for leisure. This film is like an 'action movie valu-pack.' All the ingredients of your favorite action movie flavors all in one movie! For one low price!Wouldn't it be nice if someone created a completely original character, rather than simply ripping off James Bond all the time?  Bond was a great idea forty years ago, when it was new. Example: Indiana Jones, an archaeologist searching for lost artifacts--one of the best movie characters anyone ever thought up. What we're basically offered here, though, is another spy movie about--and I still can't believe the blatant unoriginality--a madman who wants to unleash a killer virus. Tom Cruise's character, Ethan Hunt (a name almost as cool as 'Tom Cruise'), would like to stop him. Might as well call it ""Austin Powers 3."" After watching this dreck, I kind of missed the twisty, incomprehensible plot of 1997's ""Mission: Impossible."" Even if you couldn't understand what was going on half the time, at least it was interesting. At least the story held true to the spirit of the ""Mission: Impossible"" TV series and opened with a team mission. The excuse for Cruise being a loner for the rest of the movie is that most of his team members are killed in that opening sequence (sorry for the spoiler). In the sequel, Robert Towne and John Woo have no such excuse. They never even attempt to introduce a team concept.Instead, we're given Tom Cruise. With long hair. Riding a motorcycle. Through fire. In slow motion. The film's creators go to great lengths to insure their star looks as cool as possible. I can't understand why Cruise wants to be Jean-Claude Van Damme all of a sudden. He doesn't even know martial arts, and yet here he is, jumping around, kicking people in the face. Who decided, I wonder, that two guys who can't fight beating the crap out of each other was fun to watch?John Woo's goal, to break his own record for slow motion shots in a film, is achieved here (when a dove flies across the frame in slow motion as a stony-eyed Cruise walks toward us, I swear I wished it would crap on him). Had all of M:I 2's slow motion shots been done at normal speed, the film would've been a half hour long.  Woo invented what is now being dubbed ""beautiful violence,"" a filming style now in use by every action director on earth. With his latest, Woo seems determined to drive his own invention into the ground.Grade: D",Mission - Impossible II
265,Jona1988,Mildly entertaining action and stupid plot,5,8 January 2012,"When people arrived at the cinema for this movie I imagine the film crew stood at the entrance saying something like ""Welcome in for this screening of MI2 but please leave your brain outside"". Well symbolically speaking but that really describes this movie. I heard several saying that the plot of the first movie is so hard to understand and I can agree somewhat. It took me a few viewings to follow it completely but it's really not that sophisticated one then realises. Well anyway seeing the sequel one wonders if the producers said something like ""So people thought the plot of the first was complicated so lets just disregard any story for the sequel"". I'm not against mindless action movies, sometimes it's really comfortable to just lean back and not think a lot but just enjoy. However if find myself not being able to suspend my disbelief here because MI2 is not simple but rather completely stupid, treating it's viewers as retards. According to the trivia on IMDb the screenwriter claims he wrote the story around action scenes that John Woo had thought out. It must be true! Many of the action scenes come out of nowhere whatsoever. I go like what the hell is going on with the story? Not in a way that I don't understand but that you understand to well that is makes less sense than a Donald Duck cartoon. It goes so far as one scene Ving Rhames close to turns to the audience and clearly explains what is happening now, why they have to do this thing. Who does the filmmaker think the viewers are? Even underaged would see this as ridiculously easy. The actors play the typical stereotype one expects form this kind of mindless action movie, the hero is so cool and the villain is evil in every way. I'm no hater of Tom Cruise because I can distinguish between his work and him in private which I mostly try to ignore, he seems to be quite a weird guy. Dougray Scott is well enough as the villain and it feels somewhat too bad his career never took off. Thandie Newton has no other purpose than looking hot. The style of the movie is just like you expect from John Woo but actually even more extreme of every of his trademarks. You won't get action more over the top than this. It's looks good but the first film wasn't even near this type so this doesn't quite feel like a sequel, had they just changed the names one wouldn't even know. So the action is good but it's just too much. Not even James Bond would get away with this, don't get me wrong I love the 007 movies. Add so much cheesy dialogue and dramatic music and I'm somehow embarrassed when I once watched this with someone that knew nothing about Mission: Impossible. The action is great but Mission: Impossible 2 goes from simple to insultingly dumb. Sorry I can't take this movie, it barely passes for the acceptable grad which on my scale is 5/10.",Mission - Impossible II
266,Jack_Yan,More John Woo claptrap,4,18 May 2003,"It's about time John Woo got back to making movies, rather than two-hour-long self-tributes. I used to be a fan when he put the moviegoing audience first and he gave us some great actioners when he first arrived in Hollywood (e.g. Broken Arrow, Hard Target). And for the first 20 minutes, in the initial scenes and those in Seville, it seemed like Mr Woo was back on form. Not for long.This, like Face/Off, seems a demonstration of Mr Woo believing the reason he was hired was to showcase his style. Either that or he is afraid we might miss his style, so we're force-fed it. It's not that I don't appreciate his genius, but I can only take so much of slow-motions, close-ups and two-gun Tommy getting in the way of the story's flow. Call me old-fashioned.With the greatest respect to a fellow southerner, Mr Woo's best recent work was his BMW commercial, The Hire: Hostage, starring Clive Owen. Watch that about 13 times back to back and it's a better way of getting the same quantity of John Woo style than trying to make head or tail of this Hollywood-moneyed insult to Bruce Geller's memory. The only sign of this film being distinguished was Tony Hopkins's brief presence as the IMF boss.Oh, it's nothing to do with the TV series. But you knew that.",Mission - Impossible II

To me it seemed that ever aspect of this film was overdone for more of a dramatic effect from the simple eye staring when Ethan and Nyah first saw each other to the outrageous bike chase at the end.Despite the fact that this was initially a t.v. series, I believe the pace of the films were set with the first movie. This movie totally went beyond realism and went into total stupidity. Am I to believe that at the end of the film when the bike chase was going on that and they were heading at each other at what seemed 90 miles per hour each / BUT WAIT, lets lessen that. Lets say they were going 40 miles per hour each. The impact that they hit each other when they jumped off the bikes would still be 80 miles per hour. LET'S GO EVEN FURTHER. Had they survived that hellish impact, they would not be able to jump back up and start pounding on each other in a full fight. Like I said it was too unrealistic.The music during the action scenes were also too much. Just shoot the damn gun and scream. I don't need the music to make it sound dramatic.
That is why I liked the first one so much more. It was believable, it had it's villains, as well as good guys. Then there were the people in between. It went to the edge of realism, but still kept you in the real world.

The only reason this movie isn't a 5/10 is because it has AWESOME action and a HUMUNGOUS twist at the end.The twist is so surprising! My mouth was open throughout the rest of the movie! That's about 20 minutes! It was also quite startling and disturbing, so don't let any young children see this movie!

There is a lot of intense chase scenes and sequences of punching and fighting and stabbing and rolling around and gunshots.

277,gbkimberley,They saw us coming,3,17 March 2012,"There was no Impossible Mission. This was just a vehicle for Tom Cruise' ego. I remember the original MI series (And the first half of the first movie) being about a 'Team' of people, all experts in particular skills, who would come together and, as a 'Team' would tackle an 'Impossible' mission.This was nothing like either the series, or even MI-I. Ethan Hunts 'Team' consisted of a communications expert who loses contact with him, an Australian (Presumably cast because it was filmed here) helicopter pilot and an internationally notorious thief who couldn't even pick a pocket properly.Action fans won't be too disappointed as Mr Hunt manages to kill all the bad guys from every manner of impossible position and situation whilst defying both gravity and physics. Fortunately in order to accomplish this he has acquired a gun that never needs reloading or cleaning and that is magically attached to his hand by an invisible force.Most filmgoers will be disappointed though as this movie is filled with clichés, bad acting from most of those with more than 10 minutes screen time, scenes copied from other movies and total plot cop outs.In conclusion I would say that after the success of MI-I Mr Cruise & Woo saw us coming.Glen Kimberley as gbkimberley",Mission - Impossible II

I wish I had fallen asleep or had to run to the bathroom 8 times during this 2-hour bore-fest.

Some might say, ""this movie rocks,"" and yes, the soundtrack is very loud and the editing is tight, but the story is about ten minutes of plot with lots of endless NOTHING GOING ON for a long long time.

280,ufo0001,Vanity show for Cruise,4,2 May 2002,"Pros: Action sequences.Cons: Score, overexposure of cruise, tries to be like James Bond.After the brilliant Mission Impossible, the series has taken a turn for the worse under the helm of John Woo. Cruise fans should love this movie because he is basically in almost every scene and always smiling. In the first film he acted, this one he basically just flashes his smile, what's up with that. The script is nonexistent and how many times do we really need a face-change sequence. John Woo has recently had a bad streak since he came to hollywood and this is his worst film. Cruise doesn't even assemble a team when he captures Thandy Newton, he basically does it himself. Ving Rhames who was good in the first film feels like his role is basically a cameo. This film has lost its roots from the television show and instead wants to be like James Bond. Thandie Newton is basically eye-candy, she isn't even needed for her skills as a thief but instead for her skills at seducing. Dougray Scott is a bad villian. What the h**l happened to the brilliant score of Danny Elfman, instead the score is rocked-up. The only saving grace of this movie is the motorcycle sequences. The fight scenes between Scott and Cruise is lethargic at best and seems like a fight out of WWF smackdown. Who cares about Chymera and Belereform. Hopefully Fincher can save the series.Premise: Hunt must stop a deadly virus.Mission: Impossible 2 was not nominated for an Academy award but it won MTV awards and was nominated for Razzies.Grade: 4/10 (Horrible).",Mission - Impossible II
281,baba44713,Dumb formulaic action movie,3,21 April 2006,"I was quite impressed with the first Mission Impossible. I half-expected a dumb Hollywood remake with some obscure references to a TV show I have never seen, but what I got was a semi-intelligent entertaining and spy movie with quite a few twists and surprises.I was actually quite eager to see the sequel. When I heard John Woo was directing MI2, I thought - great, instead of a good spy/action movie I will get a slow-mo fest with car wrecks and pigeons. Was I right? Unfortunately, one hundred percent.MI2 looks and feels like a 2-hour recording of a video game. Pretty people (people in question mainly being Cruise and his love interest) run, drive, shoot and generally do acrobatic things, almost half the time in slow motion. There is a generic action movie plot (villain steals thing X to do a dastardly thing Y and our hero has to stop him while THE CLOCK IS TICKING) right out of a B-action movie starring Steven Seagal or Michael Dudikoff, or an episode of Action Man cartoon series. No real team-based action, no spy angle, nothing. Just Cruise selling his hairspray commercial smile before doing some acrobatic stunt which should kill an average men ten times over.The flick really goes for the lowest possible denominator. No effort is spent into putting some logic or thought into the plot. The ""rubber mask"" shtick is so overused it is painful to watch. The action scenes never end, bullets, crashes and explosions are non-stop, yet the main characters never even get bruised. I could proceed but you get the point - this is a dumb formulaic action movie that uses every cliché in the book and isn't even entertaining.John Woo is a director with one trick up his sleeve and is seriously overusing his welcome. Tom Cruise obviously just wants us to watch his pretty face. Together they created a movie that is hardly worth seeing it for free, let alone paying for it.3/10",Mission - Impossible II
282,ShinKyo81,Where's the Mission Impossible?,7,10 July 2000,"I mean, where's the thrilling-intelligent-packed movie which was the first ""Mission:Impossible""? Brian De Palma made a fine conversion from the TV series, ya know, incredible ""James Bond""-type situations, suspense and elaborated plot... But this film isn't ""M:i-2"", it's just ""How to be a pretty action hero, kill some bad folks & win a beauty girl"".I'm not saying that ""M:i-2"" is crap. It's not. But I see it's nearer the HongKong-type films than the M:i TV series.Despite the result of the film like a Mission:impossible sequel, John Woo fans will love it. It has all the small things that make Woo's creations different: fantastic shooting scenes, incredible camera movements, spectacular one-to-one fights, awesome pursuits and, of course, a very good-smart-handsome hero and the bad-to-bone villain. And the pigeons, of course :)Just one thing: M:i-2 affirms that typical sentence: ""2nd parts aren't good"". It's not as good the first one, but it's not a bad film.

283,Mr.Uxo,Cruising for Action...,8,24 May 2000,"I give this movie an 8 because throughout the film I was cruising for some R-rated action, more than even Tom Cruise was able to deliver.  Don't get me wrong, this film was action packed; however, I feel the movie was directed this time at mainstream and young audiences thus the PG-13 rating.  Director John Woo is know for his all out violent and action packed films like The Killer, Bullet in the Head and Hard Boiled.  Here the action is thick and heavy with sweat rather then ketchup (blood).  The ending was less then desirable.  What saved this movie for me was Great Special Effects, Tom Cruise, Ving Rhames and the Aussie and a nice musical score.  My favorite scene would have to involve the pigeon sequence so don't get any popcorn during this part!",Mission - Impossible II
284,ksaelagnulraon,"Boring, long remake of the 1996 blockbuster",5,5 January 2002,"Many Hollywood ""sequels"" are merely inferior remakes, this being no exception, as our hero Cruise is introduced to many dangerous and death-defying situations, all of which he of course escapes unscathed.  The first film was good (at best!), the most distracting part being the frequent ""I'm not who you think I am because I'm wearing a mask so that I look like someone else"" trick, which unfortunately resurfaced in M:I-2.  This time we're ready for it, and it becomes less of a ""aha, they got me there"" trick, and more of a ""christ, will they give it a rest already?"" annoyance. Honestly, it's a copout gimmick that should have died with the original series.  M:I-2 is simply another 007 film under an assumed name, with a few minor differences: ""Bond"" (aka Cruise) actually falls in ""love"" with the female lead, and of course that whole pull-the-face-off thing. Interestingly it was voted a major bomb by audiences (who of course went to see it anyway because of its hype and because of the Cruise-Kidman connection) in Australia - the same audiences which love the Bond films!! ""Bond by any other name is not as sweet?""  I was surprised at the average user rating of M:I-2... 6.0/10 is far higher than it deserves, and I'm interested to find out why so many people seemed to like it so much.  We've seen it all before, ""it"" being a cross between MISSION IMPOSSIBLE (1996), any recent 007 film (say, TOMORROW NEVER DIES) and those dodgy martial arts films which try to back spectacular, anti-realistic fight sequences with intelligible plot.  And it goes on and on and ON and ON!!!  How long can a dumb action ""thriller"" get?  I suppose they did pad it with frequent, unnecessary slow-motion replays and a ridiculous, operatic score...there's no doubt in my mind that this is one of those films which benefits from IMDb's system of audience ratings, in that people get home from seeing a wham-bam effects-driven film on the big screen with their friends, immediately think ""gee that wasn't actually too bad"" and log in a vote of 7. In another five years this film will hardly be remembered: ""Didn't they make a movie version of the old MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE series?""  ""Yeah, it was pretty dodgy. Didn't it star Tom Cruise or someone?""  ""I think so.  Actually wasn't there a sequel?""  ""LOL. There must have been. It is Hollywood after all...""  Rating: 5/10.",Mission - Impossible II

286,jmoney-2,"A heart racing thrill-ride, John Woo at his best",8,28 May 2000,"In ""Mission:Impossible -- 2"" Tom Cruise's mission is clear -- make a sequel that stands out.  And it's Mission:Accomplished, thanks to the actor/producer's hiring of Hong Kong Action Master John Woo as the film's director.On the surface, the addition of Woo means Cruise's IMF Agent Ethan Hunt now fires two guns at once inside of one.  It also means that Tom Cruise, Hollywood Mega Star Pretty Boy instantly becomes Tom Cruise, Kung Fu Badass.But there's more to Woo's style than just slo-mo angles of double-fisted gunplay and ludicrously acrobatic karate moves.  The director brings an over-the-top, operatic melodrama to the standard espionage story that justifies the preposterously far-fetched action.   Woo's accent marks are all over the film -- from a scene very early on showing one character's split-second vision of apocalyptic doom, to a close-up of a fire reflecting in the villain's tormented eyes, and to -- perhaps most memorably -- a ubiquitous John Woo white dove preceding one of Cruise's most dramatic entrances.  The movie is much closer to Woo's classic films than to anything on the old '60s TV show.The film's last 45 minutes are a non-stop, heart-racing ride.  The sequence concludes with another standard John Woo feature -- two friends, turned mortal enemies, in a prolonged mano-a-mano slugfest death match in a remote area, in this case a rocky cliff above the ocean.  It doesn't get more dramatic than that, and movies don't get more thrilling than ""Mission:Impossible -- 2"".",Mission - Impossible II
287,DD-931,Action For Imbeciles,2,14 November 2004,"This movie is a prime example of the level of idiocy the Hollywood action movie has reached at the turn of the century. A ten-year old could make a more believable (and therefore more compelling) movie than this. How can people get caught up in the action sequences when they have no connection with simple laws of physics or causality? How can you think the hero is in jeopardy when he is beyond superhuman? Compared to this lunacy of a movie, the Connery Bond films were docudramas. I suppose if this had been tongue-in-cheek it would have been more tolerable, but Tom Cruise & Co. obviously expected the audience to take this garbage SERIOUSLY.I am glad to say the film studio didn't make a penny off me for this movie.",Mission - Impossible II

Granted, most of the film's action sequences are unrealistic, and slow motion shots are used entirely too often.But director John Woo sure knows how to make an exciting movie.  Even though I was certainly aware of the impossiblity of Tom Cruise's Double Dragon style fighting maneuvers, I was nevertheless entertained.

The movie went down a little from there and wasn't able to pick up again towards the end. Thandie Newton also was underused in this movie, I felt she had alot more talent that was portrayed in this film.

The action scenes are the most ridiculous, over-the-top, comedic, absurd, preposterous action scenes ever filmed. I laughed out loud several times. EVERYTHING explodes when Cruise shoots it...EVERYTHING - don't be surprised if you see wooden chairs exploding in this movie. Cruise does the most pointless stunts imaginable, like dragging his feet on the side of a motorcycle (COOL!!!!??) and doing nose wheelies across the street on his motorcycle (NEAT!!!!!) I was actually waiting for Cruise to do a dance after his K.O. on the sand, take off his glasses, crush them under his foot, then wink at the camera and do a thumbs up just in case. Cruise is also a master fighter, gunman, base jumper, biker, driver, and all-around perfect guy.Bad guys chase after Cruise, who is actually invincible in this movie, and die left and right in bloodless, painless deaths. It actually makes violence fun and cool! The bad guys outnumber Cruise and unload hundreds of bullets and can't even come close to hitting him, yet Cruise can do barrel rolls off of motorcycles while shooting his gun and blowing up trucks with ease. I was hoping he would've been blindfolded - wouldn't have been implausible. This might appeal to a 9-year-old. That seems to be the target audience. The 2-disc DVD has almost 10 minutes of bonus features! There's a skit, some awards show excerpts, and a very short documentary. That's it. Real pathetic cash-in.

The only saving grace was that we were thankfully not subjected to John Woo's (in)famous slow motion scenes continuously throughout the movie at inappropriate times.  There were a few, but they weren't too distracting.  Cruise wasn't his usually best, but he did an adequate job.  At times I found myself talking to my girlfriend... the movie was just not interesting between the lulls in action.  Don't expect any surprises, like part 1 had.

Mr. Cruise has proven time and again (see RAIN MAN, MAGNOLIA, BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY) that if given the right material to work with, he is one of the best actors working today.  Mr. Woo has proven time and again that he is a master of the action film (see HARD BOILED and THE KILLERS).  So what happened here?  My guess is that the script by Robert Towne is simply not good, and so even if one brings in John Woo there is only so much he can do.  To be sure, there are some very impressive sequences in this film, but you just don't care.

So when I heard that there was to be a sequel I was pleased- so trotted off to my local movie emporium to see it. The fact that it had John Woo directing it (whose other big Hollywood movie ""Face Off"" was great fun) just added to my expectations. Two hours later I came out of the cinema in silence. It was that bad.The main problem with it is the screenplay. It provides the crew with little sense of either character or substance. The plot is comically contrived and the characters are immediately dislikeable. Woo obviously decided to try and cover the lack of substance in the script with flashy direction. However this highlights the movie's faults even more with a hugely narcissistic opening sequence which makes Tom Cruise appear to be some kind of false idol. What this film reminds me of, is Armageddon, the ill-fated 1998 disaster flick which has inspired so many rants on the imdb.

The actions are cool and awesome. The drama is a little touching. Unfortunately, I don't really think that Thandie Newton is the right person to play the Nyah's role. No hard feeling.

I admit he is not one of my favorite actors, and despite the huge efforts that Hollywood made to include him in the big league I still have not seen him delivering a great performance. Certainly his performance in this movie is light-years from being noteworthy. With the help of a tiresome script, he desperately tries to be the ""anti-Bond"" cool cat, and the results are pathetic. But he is not even the worst thing in the movie. The storyline is... well, I would say ""predictable"" but that is an euphemism. All we get in this movie was seen before in other movies (mostly in average and bad movies, anyway). It is like a collection of the tiresome Hollywood standards for action movies. A futile love story, the usual bad guy that wants to do one of the standard bad things (I won't spoil it... just think of three things the standard bad guy from mediocre action movies would do, and you probably got at least two right).

Still even if this movie seems to be more Bond Then MI I still recommend it.  The only thing I didn't like due to lack of originality but the action of it was still good (and this may be a spoiler) is that the final showdown seemed very much like the end another one of Woo's movies yet this time it took place on land rather then water.My review is a 7.",Mission - Impossible II

The story feels rather uninteresting. John Woo directs seemed to not be sure what he was doing with this film. It feels messy all the way through. *Cinematography/Editing: Jeffrey L. Kimball does some disappointing work in this film. Much like the previous film, it feels like a home video throughout most of it. The editing is also poor. It was not as exciting as it should have been. It was hard to get drawn into the film. *Dialogue/Acting: The dialogue is a minor improvement from the first film, but is still corny at times. The acting improves. Tom Cruise does his job again. Thandie Newton does well, but the direction makes her seem less impressive than she really is. The minor role of Anthony Hopkins is well performed. The villains are a bit more frightening than in the first film. *Music/Sound Design: The music makes this film seem a lot better than it really is. It does not match well, because the music is more intense than the events on camera, but it does make the whole production seem a bit more professional. The sound design is about the same as the first film, which means it is slightly disappointing. *Production Design/Special Effects: The sets feel too much like studio sets. They are not immersive or real feeling. The wardrobe choices are still strange, but better than the first film. The special effects improve on what the first film began, but they have a long way to go.*Conclusion: ""Mission: Impossible II"" makes some improvements from the first film, but it is still a disappointment and feels too unprofessional in a lot of ways.",Mission - Impossible II

There was a fourth guy, i'm sure. That's so sad that I remember that.How can this movie be so cool and disappointing at the same time? Let me break it down for you kittens. John Woo fans (I count myself as one) should not be anything but thrilled by this movie. But here's the catch-- it's also a Mission: Impossible movie, and the two don't mix quite as well as you might think.I loved the first M:I film. Have no idea if it followed the TV show faithfully, nor do I care. DePalma and Cruise kick so much booty in that one. This is why I have problems with the sequel. This stuff has been eating away at me since seeing the movie, so it's good to get it off my chest. When, between the two films, did Ethan Hunt become James Bond? I wouldn't have blinked if Newton's name in the film was Youwanna Humpme. I was so bored by the relationship between Cruise and Newton in the film. When did they fall in love? I must have missed that part, I only remember the shagging. I didn't care for the new, self confident Ethan Hunt. I enjoyed his awkward moments in the first movie.Other things that didn't sit well with me-- when did Ethan learn to fight? Didn't old man Voight take him down with one punch in the first film? He's gotta be, what? 60? Since when does Luthor (Rhames) know anything except computers? I remember him hiding in the bathroom from the Swedish-looking guy in the first film, this one he's blowing up cars with a grenade launcher from a helicopter. Are these the same characters? Don't get me started on the Aussie...Dougray Scott is dull as the bad guy. A Bond villain, really. Everything about this movie smells like James Bond, I swear, I wonder if they had this 007 script lying around and decided to switch the names around. He pokes fun at Cruise and that big stupid grin of his. Yeah, what about that smile? A little of smiling Tommy boy never hurt a movie. Cruise is so serious in this film. I like Tom. Smile more, buddy!The action scenes were magnificent, except.... and I hate myself for thinking this, but.... I started wondering, ""What is the point of this, besides the fact that it looks cool?"". And I hate myself! I never question Woo's over the top action scenes, I just sit back and enjoy. Why did I question it this time? Because it's Mission: Impossible, and I don't know where the Mission: Impossible part came in. The first movie, you could break it down into three main scenes-- the embassy party mission, the CIA in Langley mission, and the train mission. This one has lots of shooting and kicking. I love shooting and kicking! But not in M:I. This movie really needs more brains.I had heard rumors that there was some conflict between Cruise the producer and Woo on set. This originally outraged me. How dare the big pretty boy star throw his weight around with one of my favorite directors? After seeing this i'm wondering, ""Maybe Cruise gave him too much room to play with"". The action sequences (especaily the last act) would have made more sense if the whole movie was a virtual reality game Ethan was playing. If he Wachowski's don't have the time to direct the Matrix sequel, Woo could do wonderful things with that movie, I think.Gotta wrap this up, did I write all this? If you're a Woo fan, you should love this movie. It probably tops all his other films for stunt work and action sequences. I expect his next movie will be even bigger.

Who cares?,10,8 July 2000,"Just to get down the negative critics list right at the beginning, so we can talk about the things that are good in this film (which is, in my opinion, a lot):1) Yes, the plot is pretty weak compared to the first Mission: Impossible. But activate your brain for a moment, would you? Do ""James Bond""-films have a great plot? What about ""Die Hard"", ""Con Air"", ""The Rock""? If you open your eyes and take a closer look you'll find that even ""The Matrix"" doesn't have as great a plot as most people claim, in fact it did copy a lot from other films. The story of M:I-2 doesn't have any major flaws and JOHN WOO perfectly covered up the weakness of the plot.2) Going into the same direction is the predictability of the film. It was fairly simple to recognize whether a character was wearing a mask or not. But the expressions on some of the person's faces were intentionally created in a way that would allow us to find out about the disguise before the characters did.Well, that's about everything negative I could possibly find.Now let me ask you, all you people who gave this movie bad ratings: DID YOU EVEN SEE THIS MOVIE? DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA; WHAT ACTION IS ABOUT?Action is not about blowing everything to pieces Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer style. It is not about shooting as many people as possible just to see that it's done. And it is definitely not about throwing some computer-generated effects & explosions at the audience.And what's that crap about the action in M:I-2 not being possible in real life? Of course it isn't! Otherwise, why would we go see films in theatres and pay money for it? Wake up! Get real! Name one big blockbuster action movie which was actually realistic! Anybody? Just because there is no Matrix (some of you would probably say: ""How would you know?"") doesn't mean the film s****!It's sad that the majority of people don't appreciate JOHN WOO's work. No other director did or will get close to what JOHN WOO has achieved. He's not just a simple director, he's more than that. He's a virtuoso, a master of his field. His films are PURE AESTHETIC ART! He's the only one with the feeling for it, the only one capable of doing anything like M:I-2. JOHN WOO is the best thing that happened to Hollywood in a long time.I am a big fan of JOHN WOO, actually I consider him the GOD OF ACTION, not mainly because of films like ""Broken Arrow"" or ""Hard Target"" but rather because of his Hong Kong masterpieces (i.e. ""The Killer"", ""Bullet in the Head"" etc. etc.). I always thought that he didn't reach the level of the aforementioned Hong Kong films in Hollywood yet, because those Hong Kong films contained not only lots of action but - even more important - themes like friendship, loyalty and love.""Hard Target"" was very good, ""Broken Arrow"" was visually astounding, and ""Face/Off"" was simply outstanding. For a long time I would consider ""Face/Off"" the best action film (along with ""Terminator 2""). Just a few hours ago JOHN WOO made me change my mind, when I saw the showdown of his newest masterpiece. I was amazed, the action and dynamics of the movie were way better than anything I had ever seen, it was gripping and at the same time BEAUTIFUL, it was SHEER BEAUTY that came off the screen right at me (and the pigeons are beautiful too, over and over again, this time even more than in his other films). This is JOHN WOO's first American film which can actually compete with films like ""Hard Boiled"" or ""The Killer"" (both by JOHN WOO, of course) in terms of action & choreography. I wasn't sure if I would ever be able to say that.Like I said: the action is beautiful. When there are cars exploding, they're not just flying away with much noise, filmed in a rather clumsy slow-motion as in Michael Bay's typical video-clip imagery (he's an excellent director, believe me, I like him, he's just nowhere as magnificent as JOHN WOO). Instead, in M:I-2, scenes like the car explosions are filmed in a way that's as close to perfection as it will probably get. The camera angles are well chosen, the cuts are at the right places in the film, and the camera speed fits perfectly. Also the beginning of the film where we see Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) climb up the wall, is perfectly filmed. Check out how wonderfully the camera moves in towards the actor right at the beginning of the scene!Another highly exciting scene is the shoot-out in the lab. The music (by Hans Zimmer, the god of soundtracks) is combined with the imagery so ingeniously that it felt like a dream, an ecstasy of pure beauty (again this word; sorry, but it's the word that best describes JOHN WOO's style).Many people have criticized the acting in the film. Of course, none of the actors will be nominated for an Oscar, but on the other hand the acting was not that bad either. Tom Cruise was very convincing, Thandie Newton did a decent job and so did the villain (Dougray Scott), although he was not as charismatic as movie-villains usually are. But if you hate the acting in M:I-2 so much, then let me tell you one thing: except for very few movies (one of them being ""Face/Off"") there are nearly no Hollywood action films with a superb cast. Take ""The Matrix"" (""Why always this film?"" you might ask. Well, because I think it is an excellent film but, in my opinion, generally overrated) for instance: Did this film have good acting. You think it did? Well I think it was just very good at pretending that it did by throwing in cheesy statements like ""it is the question that drives us"" and ""what is real?"" etc. trying to give the characters some profundity.Personally, I think M:I-2 should set a new standard for action in Hollywood (but I'm afraid it won't). I saw this film today and likely, I'll watch it again tomorrow.Overall: BEAUTIFUL, LOVELY, AMAZING, WONDERFUL...My rating: 10/10 (Thank you, JOHN WOO)",Mission - Impossible II
306,apocalypse later,Choose not to accept.,1,1 June 2000,"I loved the first Mission:Impossible film.  LOVED IT.  Beautiful European locations.  Complex plot that had to be experienced twice to fully understand (how refreshing!).  World-class cast playing well-defined characters, spouting witty, intelligent dialogue (Jon Voight!  Vanessa Redgrave!  Jean Reno!  Emmanuelle Beart!  Kristin Scott Thomas!) Magnificent set pieces (the restaurant explosion, the embassy ball, the high-security hanging-by-a-thread break-in, the high-speed train/helicopter/tunnel finale).  Suspense, humor, drama... and all of it involving and thrilling.Mission:Impossible 2 is exactly the opposite.  Stock characters, stock plot, stock actors, stock locations, stock action sequences.  Instead of suspense we get gun fights and car chases.  Instead of humor we get tired double-entendres.  Instead of drama we get ""Octopussy""-level heavy breathing.  Gone is the idea of Ethan Hunt being part of a M:I team.  Now he's a stock superman, invincible and therefore totally boring.  As is the film.  A shame.",Mission - Impossible II
307,vhilden,"Jackie Chan does James Bond, wearing a rubber mask?",6,3 July 2000,"I think M:I-1 had a much better plot. At least, it DID have a plot. If there is any plot at all in M:I-2, it's carefully disguised in a rubber mask. The formula for making this film was: get a James Bond film, remove all the girls but one, put in some Jackie Chan gymnastics, and add a few rubber masks. Anyway, those masks are great for the suspense, you never know who is who.For an action fan like me, this is a very good film, as one could expect from John Woo. Very dynamic, if you know what I mean. At several points, I thought ""Ouch! That must hurt!"". The action scenes are well distributed along the film, with the power steadily increasing to the breaking point at the end. The motorcycle chase, in particular, is among the best chase scenes I have ever seen in the movies.To enjoy this film, turn off your left brain hemisphere and activate all your adrenaline receptors. I rather liked it, but not too much. It's more like ""Mission: Frenetic"". And it should have more, prettier, girls. I give it a 6.",Mission - Impossible II
308,gromit-17,Sleek but instantly forgettable,6,30 May 2000,"This movie was masterfully executed but it lacks of the intriguing plot and suspense of the first one, a requirement for an intelligent spy movie. By the end of the movie, I was bored by the excessive shoot out, explosion, and the silly motorcycle chasing and fistfight. John Woo criticizes that the first MI movie is *too cold*. I think this movie is even colder (guns, cars, motorcycles). I admire Woo's talents of handling action sequence but some how his ego and personal style has got into the way (instead of enhancing) of a good story telling. The result is an unsatisfied movie experience.",Mission - Impossible II

310,cwpnewpaltz,Boring and unbelievable,3,6 November 2000,"What a turkey!! At least the first Tom Cruise MI movie paid lip service to the constructs and concepts of the original TV series. This was nothing but the conceit of Cruise's ego. A boring virus story (done much better in The Andromeda Strain and even Dustin Hoffman's virus movie of a few years ago) becomes the excuse for all the trickery of boring recent James Bond movies combined with the violence of Terminator II raised to the nth power. I put on the DVD and after ten minutes realized I'd rather read pre-election coverage in the NY Times, and THAT's boring. It turned out to be perfectly possible to read same and watch the movie simultaneously, missing nothing of consequence because there was nothing of consequence.And there are the special features of the DVD, which attempt to make us believe that Cruise did all these rock stunts in Moab HIMSELF, 2000 feet in the air, with no net or rope, and made the same unbelievable jump about 15 times to get the shot right. Oh sure. Tell me another one.",Mission - Impossible II
311,kxok630,Hilarious,2,21 August 2007,"Sidesplitting comedy starring Kryptonian super hero Ethan Cruise. He is impervious to bullets, and can outrun them too.Oh, this movie is bad. Really bad. The world's least exciting action hero and renowned James Bond wanna-be chases around for some miracle virus that can croak everybody. Originality such as that is on a par with a Scooby Doo cartoon, and remarkably, the story gets even stupider. There are about a hundred thousand faceless enemy agent guys for you-know-who to beat up or shoot up or blow up, while they fire thousands of rounds at him and.....miss. The lethal stuff? It of course is kept in a tiny vial that's designed to shatter if you look at it the wrong way.The female lead (both actor and character) is a paper doll cutout, apparently from a fashion magazine, who manages to act down to the level of our hero. Did I mention he's on screen about 100% of the time? When he's not delivering brilliant lines like, ""You won't die,"" he's having high speed motorcycle chase/fist fight with some guy, saving the world while moving in endless slo-mo shots, and staring blankly at other actors when they talk.What's so humorous about this trash is how seriously it takes itself. The hilarity factor raises my vote on this about 5 notches from its actual cinematic value, enough to give it a 2 overall. Laughter is great medicine, and in that respect, this movie is just what the doctor ordered.",Mission - Impossible II

Good thing I didn't see this one in theaters... I rented it months ago, and I really did not like it! For one thing, must they always have a cute little girl come in and bed the leading man? How many times have they worn that ""tradition"" out? Number two, while the special effects sure were special, I felt there was no pizzaz to them. What happened to the suspense and mystery? Oh well...I guess they can't all be winners.

313,Brawl_666,Woo takes it up the --- from Cruise,6,26 November 2009,"Powerfully lousy film-making. Lets see now, most good action films justify the pretext for the ensuing violence very well. Or they have some decent drama & emotion to prop up the action. Die Hard, T2, Speed, Point Break, The Rock are some examples that follow this basic template the best. And as such these are great, if empty, pieces of entertainment. You don't HAVE to be a teenager to enjoy these films.This film essentially has no organizing principle whatsoever. Cruise has hijacked the entire production. His ""ghost-direction"" is painfully obvious and proves to be the death knell for the film (and Woo). The whole thing is in thrall to his infantile pretty-boy narcissism (ugh!). The man STILL cant get over his looks. Cruise is *not* an authentic human being with genuine emotional response. You'll notice he has this weird thing going on in his films where his real life & thoughts creepily show up in whatever role he may be doing at the moment (Jerry Maguire, this, MI-3). And it usually has to do with his attitude to women. He turns into this psycho creep around them. His scenes in 'Lions for Lambs' with Meryl Streep made my skin curl. Oh, the horror.No more unkind words are left to heap on the hideous Mr. Tom Cruise. He's a madman, we all know that. You, dear reader, may be wondering why I'm wasting my time on such a wearying dud. I read Roger Ebert's review after watching this film last night, and it made me re-evaluate my perception of the man. The only way to make sense of that review of his is to look at it as some kind of Kaufmann-esqe parody where he's laughing at the viewer/reader. He uses some obfuscating, post-doctoral Derrida-speak to describe what is quite obviously a very bad movie. Surprisingly, for once IMDb gives this a pretty sane (though still very high) rating of 5.6/10.Marketing blitzkrieg saved this stillborn project. No wonder Paramount got fed up of Cruise.

The trailer had me very excited but when I saw it, I was glad my sister talked me out of going to see it in cinema, would have been a waste of my 20 dollars. What were they thinking by making Tom Cruise do some really lame a** fight sequences? Were they trying to make him look bad?! I think they succeeded. Several times, they showed him doing some really dumb and absurd moves!!! It annoyed me when I saw it, I just fast-forwarded!!Then there's Tom and Thandie (Ethan and Nyah). They were like a...""confused"". She particularly annoyed me with her stupid one-liners.One minute, they sleep together, then they are disagreeing! How annoying!! Then there's the villain, Dougray Scott (Sean Ambrose) who seem to know when and where Tom Cruise would be each time. Come on, John Woo, what is that?!! And what's with the wide angle camera shot at the beginning?!! Too cliche! Every action movie has that!!! And the most confusing thing about this movie, up to this day that I will never understand, is the scene where Tom and Thandie are driving and their cars start to spin parallel to each others. What..How..Who..When..?!!!! Huh?!!!! And Sean knew what Nyah was up to from the start! Come on, John Woo or whoever wrote this crappy script!! No!! And don't even get me started on the use of the face masks!! How is it that Ethan Hunt knew to carry a mask of Hugh (Richard Roxburgh) when he went to the place where they were exchanging the virus for the money?!!!! That is way too smart!!! John Woo should take a hint from the director of the ""Die Hard"" franchise. Now that is pure blooded action!! John Woo has failed in his attempt to deliver another masterpiece like ""Face Off"". May his English was so bad that Tom Cruise and the others decided ""what the hey, I can't understand him so I'll just do my own thing"" This movie should have been rated PG! The violence, my nephew was laughing at how stupid it was!!! There was no intense violence. Even a 2 year old child would pelt popcorn at the TV when this is going on because they think it is stupid!! The first movie was sooo much better than this pack of bulls***!! People only wasted their good money to see this movie because Tom Cruise was in it. I hope that the 3rd part is going to really bring back the real MI. Has the world gone mad when they were making this film?!! I would love to know who wrote this s***!! It really annoyed me! Tom Cruise, you disappointed me! That was not you! You can do much better. To movie lovers out there, STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU WANT TO GET A LAUGH BECAUSE IT IS MORE LIKE A COMEDY THAN ACTION (THE ACTION SEQUENCES WILL HAVE YOU LAUGHING IN ANNOYANCE OF THIS STUPID FILM).

318,danielloe,"Bad, just bad",4,16 June 2015,"*WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* The first Mission Impossible movie took an unexpected twist on the regular spy formula, and went in for investigation and suspense instead of action. This movie works more as a generic James Bond movie, think along the lines of Die Another Day. Tom Cruise goes from being the guy who is not skilled what-so-ever in hand-to-hand combat, to being... this. John Woo, the director, abuses slo-mo in this movie as well, making all of the fights... pretty boring actually. It's just watching slo-mo flips and kicks for the last half hour of this movie. If you look at the opening credits, the movie will make a lot more sense, because there you will see: produced by Tom Cruise. Okay, enough formless hating, let's sift through all the insanity, and talk about what does and does not work in this movie. Let's start with what does, because that's a much shorter list. Now, adding some action in was not a bad idea, maybe they might have handled it poorly, but we'll get to that in a minute. Adding in a villain was also a good idea, and making him an evil counterpart to Ethan Hunt was also a good idea, but once again, the execution was handled pretty poorly. I even think the idea of a genetic virus called Chimera could've been a good plot point, but... well, it wasn't. Now, I'd like to talk about what I always thought was the most glaring problem here, the complete change in styles. As I said, MI 1 was an intelligent investigation movie, and this is a rip off of James Bond movies. The two don't go together at all. And, yes I understand with the MI setup of different directors, you're going to have differences, but this movie isn't just directed differently, it's also directed badly. Also, let's be honest, this movie is little more than a Tom Cruise ego trip disguised as a real movie. And since Tom Cruise seems to think he has to just be some perfect agent or whatever, it's hard to connect to his character, especially when he's paired up with Thandie Newton, because the two have like the worst on screen chemistry. Dougry Scott, who plays the villain, does not give a good performance either, despite the fact that his character could've been a good villain. An evil Ethan Hunt? C'mon, how can you go so wrong with that idea? The plot, if you can call it that, seems like just a bunch of random events thrown together, and it is very confusing at times, but at the same time incredibly stupid, if that makes any sense. See, the first one was confusing, but this one just doesn't make any sense because it's so ridiculous. On one final point, I know that the first movie was very cheesy, and was just supposed to be entertaining, but this one doesn't have the lack of self-seriousness, it's like two hours of Tom Cruise going, ""Oh yeah, I'm awesome!"" Because, it's like they take all these ludicrous stunts seriously, so it's hard to have fun with the movie, aside from laughing at how bad it is. In conclusion, Mission: Impossible II is a bad movie, with a weak and under utilized cast, bad directing, a wasted story, and some very bad action scenes.",Mission - Impossible II

This is not Mission Impossible, but some sort of cheap (it wasn't cheap to make of course) James Bond rip-off. I really wondered why Tom Cruise finished this movie! It is totally dumb in comparison to his extremely well acted role in Magnolia. Personally, I think that John Woo is a good director when you look at the action sequences, and I know that he uses a lot of slow motion in these sequences. But, he used to much slow motion for me so that it became irritating and the action sequences looked too unrealistic! I liked John Woo's Face/Off and Hard Target, but this was a total flop and even more worse than Broken Arrow! Barbarella is still my number one worst movie ever seen, but this one will certainly enter the top ten of this list! What was Anthony Hopkins doing in this movie by the way?! I will conclude this extremely negative review by saying that I'm glad I only saw it on VHS for 2 dollars (I've had a bad feeling about this! (see Star Wars)) and that a lot of people were fooled by going to the cinemas to see this stupid piece of junk (see Star Wars)!!!!!!!!!!!!P.s.

I went to see it with a friend, he liked it funny enough, but i only think he said that due to being a big fan of limp bizkit. The only plus point was Thandie newton, she was absolutely stunning (that is looks and not acting).On a leaving note, did Cruise really need to flip himself so much to perform so many stupid stunts, i.e. kicking a bad guys gun out of his hand, so what does he do, thats right, he flips himself 360 degrees and just catches the gun.  What would it of looked like if the bad guy moved and he fell on his back staring up at the bloke pointing and laughing...we can only hope for a better 3rd??4/10",Mission - Impossible II

Of course barging in on Cruise why he is on vacation he is sent by Anthony Hopkins to retrieve th stolen virus before it is infected to everyone.

But this time he's against his toughest enemy - an evil alter-ego who... Oh, who gives a damn!  It's already become predictably cliched and I haven't even mentioned the love triangle OR that Hunt is acting to avenge the murder of a mentor OR the repeated face changes which were disarming in Face Off and are anally convenient here...Look, there's no doubting Woo's credentials (and he was the only reason I rented this movie!) and the action sequences are impecably executed and frequently exciting.  Unfortunately however, they go on for far too long - just like the movie as a whole.  A prime example of this is the big fight at the end.  Now it may feature some stunning choreography but there really is such a dictum as 'too much of a good thing' and by the end (in fact, considerably before that) you really don't care who wins as long as somebody does and quickly.  And I won't even mention the farcical nature of the hero being hit flush in the face with a jagged rock and not bleeding as a result! Oops - I just did...For those M:I2 fans who would choose to delve into the defence that I 'don't understand Woo or his ballet of violence' - get real!  Woo's Hong Kong films were neither as pretentious as this and nowhere near the length.  They were taut, economical expressions of a specific cinematic discipline (choreographed screen violence/action) and they advanced that discipline appreciably.  The key word here though is economic.  When the money was tight in the old days - a little action had to say a hell of a lot: And it spoke volumes.  In M:I2 however the reverse philosophy applies and consequently the action scenes say far too much - very little of which is worth listening to.Finally - the narrative and dialogue of this film are frequently trite and superficial: And by that I mean the love story!  As unbelievable as 'Face Off' was, it was clear from the outset that it was all Woo's movie (Cruise's influence here is unfortunately heavy handed) and in Cage, Travolta and Allen he had performers of a far greater calibre than he has here; and consequently they could manipulate even the most ludicrous dialogue or plot developments and make them slightly more palatable: something beyond the key players here.  Which is particularly unfortunate considering Dougray Scott's potential gravitas wasted in a cliche riddled, one dimensional monster.  I mean, even Jean Claude van Damme doesn't pretend he's in Hamlet!In short: There's little here you haven't seen before and most of the stuff that's new frequently teeters on the edge of irritation.  Woo is NOT Ang Lee and he should steer well clear of romantic drama.  Even if he's being bankrolled by an over-reaching star who's clearly unaware of the law of diminishing returns.  And I mean art - not bank balance!  Because sometimes I like to think that that's the point!",Mission - Impossible II

Thin plot, contrived action and the only redeeming thing was Thandie Newton, and if you want to see here in a REAL role, check out Beloved. Now THAT was a Thandie Newton movie.  The action is gratuitious, and unless you are a kung fu student, will be boring. I would recommend you do not waste your money on this sleeper.",Mission - Impossible II

I and four friends went to see it on Sun. and we all walked out loving it.  The critics didn't appear to like it.  That right there is a good indication that it will be good.  Critics never know what they're talking about anyway.  :) I recommend the movie to everyone.  It was exciting, suspenseful, action filled.  It was a nail biter.

I mean, guys, I know how cool Tom Cruise is and am very much aware of his sexual proweness,but c'mon! I wanted it to start off with a bang! Instead, we are given something half baked. The dialouge was very weak and there are some major holes in the plot.Predictable.Predictable.Predictable. The cast was good. They were a handsome and effective bunch. Dougray Scott was very impressive as the movie's villian, but he was weighed down by a bad script. The other thing that kind of made me upset, was that they took a lot from the movie Darkman!Those who are fans of the movie will pick up on this right away. The best thing I can say about this picture are the action sequences! Nobody does it better than John Woo! They were well staged and executed!

330,Rimmer-10,Good ole nonstop action,7,8 August 2001,"Well - you can't really expect this movie to be anything else but a gadget filled action adventure. And it is - and I found that it did a great job with a few flaws along the way.Tom Cruise has worked out - no question - but I somehow find it a bit hard to appreciate his Bruce Lee wannabe tendencies. Some of the villains that gets manhandled by Cruise are very, very slow. Their reactions (or lack of) to a sidekick/whatever from Cruise adds new meaning to the term ""a sitting duck"".All in all though - I liked the movie - I was entertained. However I would like John Woo (and/or the writers) to think about the following, if they would like to make MI:3.Why are villains bad shots? A villain with a machine gun was not able to hit Cruise with 100+ shots, but Cruise was able to hit the villain flying through the air, head down/feets up with ONE single shot.Why does villains have to talk when they have the hero on target? Why not just shoot the SOB instead of trying to talk him to death? The hero does not seem to have those tendencies when wacking the bad guys.Why does the ""number 1 villain left for dead"" have to wake up for the final scare?The above is so-so cliched I cannot believe that they are still used - and I would really appreciate a Hollywood action movie without them - they don't add anything to a movie - except annoyance.Rating: 7 of 10 - a good score - most of all because of the gadgets and Thandie Newton (woooohaaaaa).",Mission - Impossible II
331,Lanwench,"Tom and his Lovely, Lustrous Locks",5,6 June 2000,"Hey, like anyone else, I knew what I was getting into when I got tickets for this video game of a movie (and it's $9.50 in NY, so you gotta be a devoted moviegoer here) ... although I was certainly entertained, still, I must say that I was not entirely capivated. Tom tosses his hair back with the frequency of a drunk sorority girl. The rubber mask routine was entirely predictable after the first time. The slo-mo action got a little tired after a while, and Thandie Newton's character, which started out promisingly spunky, degenerated into a boring doe-eyed martyr. The plot is minimal, and even my generous willingness to disbelieve was challenged frequently by the outrageous violations of physical law. M:I2 owes quite a bit to the overblown Matrix school of camerawork (I loved 'The Matrix' but fear we are in for years of mediocre imitations). Still, it's a good matinee flick even at these inflated prices; the special effects are good, there are lots big exciting explosions and loud crashing noises, and Tom Cruise has grown into his face at long last. Plus, his hair looks damn good.As long as you aren't expecting anything profound, it's a decent Saturday afternoon popcorn-cruncher of a flick.

332,negeati,92 million dollars in the opening week-end? Are you people nuts?!,6,29 May 2000,"""Mission: Impossible 2"" is a huge disappointment. This movie is in serious need of originality. The film makers use exactly the same technology used in the original movie. This movie uses more masks than needed. When there isn't a plot, we get masks. Another thing that the movie has plenty of, is predictability. When Nyah has the virus syringe in her hands, I said to myself she's gonna infect herself. And what do you know, she did. Or when Ambrose's assistant brings Hunt in cuffs and unable to speak? I realized instantly that the masks were responsible again. There were times when I hoped not to be right. Even the simplest idea, something that wouldn't be obvious, would do. But no. Let me get from the plot to the musical score. Hans Zimmer, shame on you! What is this?! You used the theme music so many times, that it became nauseating. Your ""Gladiator"" music was a stroke of genius, and now you give me this garbage! The acting was good to OK. Tom Cruise is effective as usual and so is Thandie Newton. Even in action movie, she still impresses (she was very good in ""Beloved""). However, Dougray Scott needs a villainy infusion. He's very general and unthreatening. He requires villainy lessons from Tim Roth (probably the best movie villain) and Robert Carlyle (from ""The World Is Not Enough""). Even Joaquin Pheonix (from ""Gladiator"") was better.
Yet the movie has some suspenseful and cool scenes. Only for that, this movie gets a 6/10. P.S.: Want better action with a whole lot more of originality, and with a brain as well? Go see or re-see Ridley Scott's masterpiece ""Gladiator"". It will leave you much more satisfied.",Mission - Impossible II
333,SUGAR2TWO,Silly movie,6,16 May 2021,Just as in the first film the goofy/serious disbalance is present but overall this movie is way more consistent. The biggest problem of this one is the absurdity of most action scenes. The first movie was already over the top but John Woo brought some trademark action and overdid himself big time.The overpowered gadget from the first movie is still present so it's a big con. Still it's way more enjoyable film than you can assume. If you decided to watch the whole series don't skip this one.,Mission - Impossible II
334,Scream-11,What a great summer movie!,10,24 May 2000,"Wow.  This is what I think I've been expecting the Bond franchise to evolve into.  There's a damsel in some degree of distress (although she's quite plucky and can take care of herself most of the time, which I love), numerous gratuitous car chases (where the creators faithfully adhere to the law that any time a vehicle is struck while not currently being driven by the star, the vehicle must explode), fun gadgets, a pretty formidable bad guy, some great fight scenes...  Ah, it's awesome.  The plot is much simpler than the previous installment, but it's still got some elements that will likely confuse the crowd that kinda wants that.  It's got a nasty genetically-engineered virus, and there's even a part with Tom kind of giving a nod to fans who remember his scene from the first movie where he's suspended from a rope and must maintain his balance (of course, due to the nature of the sequel, this time the scene is even more action packed and audacious if not quite as intense).  Basically, this is just a caper movie with great technology and lots of explosions, which is what I think I wanted without knowing it.  There are no major life lessons, there's no uplifting love story... I kinda buy the Tom-Thandie chemistry a little, but mostly because I absolutely have to in order to really get the most out of the movie as a whole.  There's really no believable reason for these two to have any connection deeper than purely physical stuff, and once they are together, the chemistry doesn't really work for me.  But she is the Love Interest and as such does a great job, so I am content to nod my head at the screen, chuckle a little, and say, ""Yes, I know they're meant to be a great couple, Woo, thanks for the good try, now I'm ready for some more explosions,"" and Woo of course provides them.  So anyway, I highly recommend this movie to bring out everyone's inner 8-year-old boy who still wants to see stuff blow up and stare in thankful amazement at the show.",Mission - Impossible II

It represented one of the greatest frauds ever perpetrated upon the film going public. Since when is Mission Impossible about mindless action and simplistic plots? John Woo has turned what should have been a taut physcological thriller into an unwatchable collection of exagerrated, and therefore stupid, action sequences.

336,Dream_seeker,"if you want good intellect, Human aspect, and adventure watch the first mission impossible and Mi: 3 NOT this crap",4,8 May 2007,"Don't get me wrong, years and years ago when I seen the trailer for this...I thought, John woo directing this is awesome; then I saw this movie and from my impression not only I felt really insulted but also cheated at the fact that Mr. Woo added pretty much everything INCLUDING the kitchen sink to explode on impact with merely one bullet and some flashy moves. No disrespect to the director he really is good at his game....when he was doing old school Hong Kong flicks like hard boiled! Mission Impossible 2 (aka Mi: 2) was the long awaited and anticipated sequel to the 1996 sleeper blockbuster and based off the highly successful TV show also with the same name. But in all honestly, this movie didn't raise the bar it just made it worse and nearly almost screwed up this franchise if it wasn't for J.J. Abrams smart approach to the third installment. Tom Cruise returns as the now almost superhuman Ethan hunt who pretty much makes it clear that bullets can't touch him, he can scale mountains with his bare hands, perform flashy martial arts, and have time to woo the girl with his charms damn I'm surprise he's not playing the saxophone and surfing the stair rails blindfolded while shooting the bad guys left and right....wait a minute...I think he did do that!! The storyline is weak but simple, You see there's a virus that is capable of wiping out humanity and they gave it a code name: Chimera (oooh Greek roman history lesson somewhere) but in other to fight against this virus a anti-virus was created code name: Balerafont (cause even in viruses there are good verses evil battles!) so of course there's a race against time and they eventually needed someone who can get the job done but unfortunately superman/Ethan was climbing mountains with bare hands and another partner a sexy thief by the name of Nya (Thandie Newton)..oh yeah I forgot his team of Luther and Billy Barty (did I mention that both characters are hardly seen as much in this movie) and who can bring these guys together than Hannibal himself (Anthony Hopkins) which I think the was only there cause they must of paid him a lot but the look on his face said he was pretty much bored in this film but you be the judge on that.Lets face it the story was sub par bad (due to bad and lack of script), the romantic kindling between Tom and Thandie's character was VERY much rushed and obviously typical to the movie goer, and the bad guys were pretty much whinny little babies that can't shoot straight for the life of them but yet Ethan aka. The batman can hide in the shadows make, one shot an explosive one every damn time, can pop wheelies and burn rubber on the side with his feet while riding a motorcycle at very high speeds...did I mention he can cook too!? John Woo's approach wasn't bent on intellect like the first one and third, you can see him trying but it failed in many areas I mean DAMN even Luther (Ving rhames) didn't get that much screen time it was like Woo was saying, ""screw the black man, I want super white guy flashing his pretty hair every chance he gets"" I mean its not like woo hasn't done that before (The big hit and pretty much ALL his Americanized movies). The action scenes were pretty much IMPOSSIBLE I seen tom pretty much risk his ass in ridiculous moments in this movie it made me wonder, ""I wish I can do that!!"" but then was hit with reality and physics. This movie is pretty much a stuntman's dream with the white dove even at the climax I felt really cheated being that I could of sworn I've seen the dual shootout before (face/off) I could say more to why I didn't like this movie but I'm going to watch Mi: 3 on DVD now and be reminded on what could of been done to part 2.",Mission - Impossible II
337,TheDreadedChampion2019,JOHN WOO TRIES TO MAKE A HITCHCOCK MOVIE FOR SOME REASON BUT ITS STILL A LOT OF FUN,8,17 March 2019,"I Actually love this movie. Part of that is nostalgia and because I grew up with it but I also just unashamedly love it and the style of it. You will never see another Mission Impossible like this. With Limp Bizkit doing the theme song, this version of Ethan hunt, this dramatic, this style of action...True it Is the least like a classic mission impossible but it does feature an impossible mission and Tom Cruise is in it so that's good enough for me....and it's a hell of an entertaining and stylish spy action film....I never really looked at this as lacking action, I always thought of it as the most action packed, but the more I look at it it really doesn't start unleashing full on action scenes until the third act...and boy does it deliver. But the rest of the film is so stylish and fun that I don't care...Whereas in Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation, it kicks off with action, peaks in the middle, and slightly loses momentum coming into the third act...or in Mission 1 where it isn't even really a full on action film per say, and has only a few distinct set pieces amidst a lot of suspense and mystery...MI2 kicks off with a big bang, and then becomes a NOTORIOUS style love story and has some heist and mission impossibly stuff going on through out, but it really bottles up all the big action and stunts, saving it for the end, and then just unleashes it it all for the last 30 minutes or so....and its a great payoff. Best third act (Fallout comes close) of any Mission film and right up there with The Matrix as one of the best third acts of any action movie. Ethan Hunt jumping from that building, blatantly ripping off Last of the Mohicans (not to mention GoldenEye earlier in the film) and then building eventually into The motorcycle chase and the martial arts battle on the beach....John Woo is the Hitchcock of action films. He directs action with ease and grace and elevates it to an almost poetry. His style really elevates the material. The slow mo, the doves.... Its so great...Tom Cruise adapts perfectly to this style of action with his long hair and convincing stunt work with the guns, motorcycles, and kung fu stuff...its a movie of its time that people like to hate on. And they all raise good points. But for the style they're going for, I think this movie more than succeeds. Its entertaining and fun and cool.",Mission - Impossible II

I thought it was better than the first because it was easier to understand, and there is more fighting sequences. The motorcycle scene is by far the best scene in the movie. I own this movie on DVD, and I've watched at least 5 or 6 times. I don't get it with you people. I thought you were looking for a non stop action film. In my movie shelf this is one of the best ones. On DVD the sound is outstanding, the rockclimbing scene is awesome. The beginning of the movie is a bit hokey though, especially the tap dancing part. Another cheesy part is when Ethan and Nyah all of the sudden fall in love. When the mission starts, the great stuff starts. The thing I thought we were looking for, the action. The action is as great on DVD as it is on the big screen. So if you're looking for a movie that has great action, pick up MI-2 at the movie store on DVD if you have DVD. It has a simple plot. You people say that this movie has doesn't have a plot. If you want to see a movie that has a plot looks like a four year old wrote, see Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.

Possibly the most basic plot of all time provides the scaffold on which John Woo hangs the action in this second M:I film.Tom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt, sent to steal the Chimera virus back from baddy Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), with the help of master thief Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton).What follows from this is typical Woo; big explosions and balletic action sequences skillfully blended together.  Pure, unadulterated eye candy.The three principal characters put in workman-like performances although characterisation, like the plot, doesn't seem to have been top of the directors list.  Newton especially is relegated to a background roll pretty quickly, although she does provide a pivot around which the last third of the film revolves.  Scott as Ambrose is fantastic, although Cruise seems bemused at times by all the action going on around him.  An honourable mention must also go to Ving Rhames.The pace is frantic from start to finish, lagging only when the plot takes even a slight turn or when the next big action sequence is being lined up.A good film, but not a great one.",Mission - Impossible II

It's not a bad film, aside from the cliches. John Woo, master director that he is, has his touches to the film. But if you're looking for Woo's spectacular action sequences, forget about it, glory in the days of Hard Boiled and The Killer. Woo's symbolic touches from the mandatory doves to the poetic visuals to a character seeing what the other doesnt, are put in place of this film. His character touches however, don't seem to work as they are riddled with the cliches.

Part of it a plan to become a very wealthy individual in cooperation with a treacherous pharmaceutical executive. With the help of a former lover of the agent, Hunt infiltrates his operations and finds himself enraptured with his new romance, and driven by his job.The Review: I am nowhere near as good as the reviewer on the first page, but I have to admit, ""MI:2"" is relentlessly stupid, and borrows cliche after cliche, after cliche. There's nothing funnier than seeing the leading action hero shout ""I'm not losing you!"" to the damsel in distress, something we've seen in dozens of films in the past decade. John Woo, quite literally the best action film director today, adds a few deft touches to a film, that is just bad. It seems like all critics want to do is kiss a superstar like Cruise, right on the keyster because he's such a big star. ""Don't take it seriously."" they proclaim, as they do a direct hypocrisy of this statement with virtually any other summer film, because it may not have a big star. If you want a good action film, I suggest Woo's earlier efforts ""Hard Boiled"", ""The Killer"", and ""A Better Tomorrow II"". His poetry of violence is sprawled throughout these poetic films that are brilliant on their own level. ""MI:2"" is completely different from the DePalma film, in thought and action sequence. Grade: D+",Mission - Impossible II
343,wglenn,What Happened?,3,8 November 2004,"I was disappointed in the first Mission Impossible film but had heard that this one was better. John Woo directed it. The man who wrote Chinatown did the screenplay. Thandie Newton was in it. Everything sounds great. So what happened? MI2 is a mess, and not even an entertaining mess. For an action film, it's quite boring at times. There are long gaps between action sequences, and one has to endure some of the worst romantic dialog to come out of Hollywood in some time. Thandie Newton, who was so charming in the otherwise mediocre Truth About Charlie, is totally wasted here. I'm still trying to figure out how Robert Towne goes from writing Chinatown, which was so intelligent and stylish, to this dreck, which makes some of the bad, late-night, low-budget action shows on cable TV look pretty well-developed and coherent. An absolute flop of a screenplay. This was the first film I had ever seen by John Woo, and I can only assume that his earlier work is what gave him such a good reputation. When he finally does give us action sequences, they go on far too long and often seem ridiculous. If you find the opening sequence of the film - Tom Cruise ""rock climbing"" - silly and unbelievable, stop the video there and go on to something else, because it's not going to get any better. The worst combination for an action film is to be dumb AND pretentious, and that is what Woo accomplishes in MI2. His trademark use of slow-motion gets old quick and leaves you feeling like you're watching some slick perfume ad on TV. This is especially true towards the end of the film, when doves come flying out of the smoke and fire. Rather than care about the climax of the story, I'm wondering if a naked, anorexic blonde angel is going to appear and whisper ""Action Film, the new fragrance from Calvin Klein."" It's just silly stuff, with no sly, tongue-in-cheek awareness of its own silliness.And there are so many holes in the script... And those masks... What is it with the masks? It works the first time, seems old the second time and is just plain ridiculous the third time.I'm guessing Woo was an influence on the Wachowski Brothers, so I could be reading this wrong, but he seems to rip off several elements from The Matrix, which was released a year earlier. If only he had bothered to make MI2 as tight and smart as that film!If you're an action fan, get the DVD and skip to the chapters with the fight/chase sequences. The story doesn't make much sense and the actors struggle with the terrible screenplay, so you're not missing anything important. If you're a fan of the original series or of intelligent spy films, forget it. As bad as it was, you're better off watching the first Mission Impossible movie. At least that had some class. And I'm sure any James Bond film would be more enjoyable.",Mission - Impossible II

The tradition of not being as great as it's told to be follows in the sequel.  THere are huge characters changes in Cruise's Hunt, and his supporting team is rarely seen, the character's actions seem to belong to other people at time, and John Woo's action scene certainly aren't up to his par.However, there are several improvements from the original.  While the plot may seem rehashed, its much more tangible than the first one's, and does allow for a better villian, and a better sense of danger.  Also, the action scenes, though not great, have more action in them, but at the expense of the suspense of the first one's.

347,deltajuliet,The Citizen Kane of Action Films!,10,24 August 2006,"M:I 2 is the Citizen Kane of action films.I've heard a lot of bad-mouthing this movie, so hear me out on why it is good. Why it's great, in fact.CINEMATOGRAPHY Shots were beautifully colored in this film. Australia was bright and cheery. The Southwest's red land contrasts beautifully with the blue sky. The red-tainted Outback is that much better in the midst of a blood-red sunset. Biocyte's lab is a visual monotone of cool colors, which later pose a stark difference to sparks and explosions. M:I 2 had beautiful cinematography.PLOT I really don't follow why so many claim the plot is bad. It's certainly not as convoluted as the first, but I think that that's for the better. People speak of plot holes, but I didn't see any (nothing major, anyway). The premise was certainly more intelligent than, say, Die Hard (yippy-kay-yay, let's go kill all the motherfu**ers). It's not Syriana, but hey.ACTING There seems to be a rule in action movies that actors can't act. Now, performances weren't quite Oscar-worthy here, but this movie was really an exception to that rule. Dougray was menacing, a truly great villain. I don't think Cruise has ever let me down in the acting department. Thandie Newton was GREAT in that she wasn't the female just thrown in for the love story; she was a real person, darnit!, and she had emotions and facial expressions and wasn't just there to have sex! I mean, some have called the acting wooden, but I'll take this over Vin Diesel's monotone expression in xXx any day.DIRECTION/EDITING Very well done. M:I 2 doesn't suffer from quick cuts like so many other modern action films do. It succeeds brilliantly in its camera-work, allowing us to always understand what's going on, and giving us some very eye-pleasing shots in the process. Scenes inter-cut with each other (Cruise going into Biocyte/Ambrose explaining what he'll do, Cruise in motorcycle chase/Newton on bluff, etc.) were done not only so they wouldn't subtract from each other, but so that they complement each other and give us the bigger picture in a very well-done way.SCORE Yay for Hans Zimmer! Along with what many deem a genre change (btw, many seem to have a problem with this. I personally don't, and if you do, I'd simply ask you to go along with it. If you still disapprove, well, sorry.), Zimmer changed the theme from a more spyish tune to a much more actionesque theme that perfectly reflected the mood and genre of M:I 2. Also, ""Injection,"" the song played at the end of Biocyte Infiltration when Cruise jumps out of the building, is my favorite action song. It's a beautiful song, with vocals, strings, a drum, and if I'm not mistaken, some synth, too. It's a very ""deep"" song, perfect for a stylistic action scene that ended up being Biocyte Infiltration. It's doesn't bang you over the head with ""I'M HEAVY-METAL ACTION MUSIC!!!"" but is a soothing, ear-pleasing piece of art (yes, ART!), that adds emotion when needed, suspense when needed, and complements what is being shown PERFECTLY. Yay for Hans Zimmer.ACTION (ACTION!) Action is undoubtedly this film's biggest selling point. Some call it over-the-top, and it is, but it's nowhere near as bad as something like xXx. Also, everything shown is, though very improbable, at least possible (you've beaten out a lot of action movies, now, already). On top of that, it was AMAZING! Slo-mo when needed to add stylistic depth to Cruise running through a shot-up corridor towards an anonymous light source of hope as sparks soar through the air; a knife driving down atop Cruise's face, stopping abruptly mere MILLIMETERS from his eye (and, btw, this was done w/ Cruise for real; no special effects); Cruise lifting the rear end of his motorcycle up as a car hood passes underneath it, swinging his pistol around to shoot the gas tank of the previously mentioned car until it blows up and rolls very eye-pleasingly, etc, etc. (Actually, I think myth busters proved you can't blow up a car by shooting its gas tank, so I'll give you that; still, its a very minute detail and worth it for a very insane shot). This action is way up there, giving movies like The Matrix a run for their money.CONCLUSION M:I 2 is done so well in so many aspects that I really don't feel it should be written off as a stupid, over-the-top action movie. I mean, how many action movies in the following six years can compare in action OR plot? I think you'd run out of films before you'd get to the end of your fingers. Even if you included every action movie before it, I'd think you'd be hard-pressed to find a large number. Certainly, M:I 2 deserves more than its current 5.7 rating.",Mission - Impossible II

A Mission Impossible film has to have twists galore; surprises that don't make sense; a plot that nobody understands. Kudos to Brian De Palma. He got the genre spot on with Mission: Impossible and he was then able to flex his action biceps with the terrific train sequence and the awe-inspiring entry into the security vault. There was a romantic element to his movie also but it was always a supporting character. It aided but did not interfere with the spy movie.M:I2 wasn't even a spy movie. It was a romance first and an action movie second. The romance was destroyed by the weak nature of Thandie Newton's character. Though she began the movie as a superior thief, she quickly was reduced to no more than a damsel for Tom Cruise to heroically save.The action was also inferior to De Palma's version. Frankly, John Woo bores me. His incessant slow-motion shots were tiresome and what is his obsession with pigeons? The teaser before the credits was well done as was the rock-climbing sequence but the car chase and the overlong motor-race cum fight was to put it bluntly boring.Who cares if Cruise did all his own stunts? There weren't that many to do in the first place. I'm not bitter towards Cruise, in fact he is possibly my favourite actor when he is in a worthy movie (EYES WIDE SHUT), however this movie reaks of his interference as producer and if he did greatly interfere then his own vanity may have destroyed what could have been a successful franchise.",Mission - Impossible II
350,alexander.stroeck,Disappointed *spoilers ahead*,7,10 July 2000,"This average piece of celluloid isn´t what I was waiting for the whole summer. I had hopes, but now I´m 100% sure that Mr Cruise should have done only the stunts and leave the close ups for a REAL actor. There are only three variations of emotion in this pretty face: The smile (a favourite!), The I´m serious thinking-mask and The tight-lips hard boy face. That´s not enough to persuade me of all the super power skills that he is gifted with.I´ve seen all those uncomparable Woo-movies with Chow Yun-Fat and John Travolta. These actors are able to lift a action movie over the whole distance. I´m serious: I´m not a guy who always expects a Brando/de Niro/Eastwood/Connery etc.-personality to keep a movie going. But Mr Cruise ruins this wannabe Bond with his zero-personality.In addition this movie has the most predictible story of all Woo movies available. There is not a single surprise (don´t you think this mask-thing is a little bit overdone?).2/10 for Cruise, 3/10 for dialoges 9/10 for John Woo and the sound design",Mission - Impossible II
351,pieschel,Definitely a slight disappointment when compared to the first film,7,7 July 2000,"Mission: Impossible 2 is definitely not liked as much as Mission: Impossible was. The simple plot and strange characters bring the movie down a little bit in ratings. Thandie Newton has no idea what she's doing while acting as Nyah in this film. I would compare her acting to the acting of a dog! The rock climbing scene was exhilararting but extremely fake. As much as the articles will say: the junk about Tom Cruise really doing the stunt while being 600 feet above the ground with no safety net. His wife wouldn't have let him. Nicole would have hyperventilated like the director's in all her films do when they see her act. This movie definitely does not have the clever plotlines like that of the first one but still, Mission: Impossible 2 is an action-packed ride that will surely give action a new name.",Mission - Impossible II

And while the first one was already cheesy enough, this movie is simply on another level.Since MI2 is old news now, and probably no one will ever read this anyway, I'll just list some of the more ridiculous moments I remember:Implausible love line and how creepy Cruise is when he ""seduces"" the discount Zoe Saldana. Also how totally accidentally her perky tits are accentuated in half the shots. Sorry.The uncomfortably stereotypical Aussie dude in Ethan's team.Constant dramatic zoom-ins on the actors' faces.Constant dramatic slo-mo shots.Tom Cruise doing backflips and other Wrestlemania-style moves.Tom Cruise sliding on the concrete road while holding onto a bike.""That punk put a whole in my Versace"".How stupid it is that instead of calling in reinforcements to take down the Scottish villain, Ethan works with just 2 guys and keeps a low profile for some reason.How stupid it is that destroying the virus samples solves anything, like there the company has no data to reconstruct it at will.How stupid it is that Ethan apparently always carries a mask of himself and of the Blonde villain guy, as well as his voice modulator, in case he needs to do a totally unforeseeable switch-up in a critical moment.The beginning says ""music by Hans Zimmer"", but the music, just like everything else, is also pure trash.",Mission - Impossible II
354,Geoff-21,You've got to be kidding me,4,8 June 2000,"This movie was awful.  I feel like I've just wasted 2 hours of my life.  And my expectations going in were really high.  Tom Cruise, John Woo, Mission Impossible, what could go wrong? Well, plenty.  Too much slow motion (stunts and love scenes both, everyone in my theater was laughing when Tom Cruise and Thandie Newton were spinning around each other in their Porsches in slow, languid eye-locked embrace), plot holes you could drive a mack truck through (MINOR SPOILER: how did Ethan know which henchman he'd be tangling with to switch places with him?), and stupid villains (note to movie villains: when the hero is at point-blank shooting range, shoot him).  While some of the action stunts were cool, they drag on for way too long and wear any suspense out.  Sorry, Tom, Magnolia was really good and I'm looking forward to Minority Report, but this was not really that good.  And you're going to make about a $100 MILLION on this too. Hope Gone in 60 Seconds is better.",Mission - Impossible II

At least Days of Thunder generated some interesting characters and realistic conflict.The conventional wisdom is that people don't go to action movies to have to think.  The people that believe that will be more than happy with M:I-2. Nothing challenging about it, except for caring one whit about the characters.  Batman cartoons have deeper characters--and plots, for that matter--than this.  Was it fun?  Oh...yeah.  It's flashy, and got some cool stunts and whatnot.  It's decent matinee entertainment.But that's not what I expect from this kind of talent.  I expect sharp dialogue, layers of story, depth of character, texture.  It is possible for an action movie; anyone recall a movie called Raiders of the Lost Ark?  It's extra disappointing for something like this to be what it is.  I shouldn't have to consider whether it was fun or not with talents the likes of Cruise and Towne attached.  This could have been--*should* have been--so much better.  I'd like to be able to put all the blame on John Woo, since all his movies suffer from the same malady to varying degrees, but Cruise, nice as he is, deserves a hardy head-smack as co-producer.  In the end he had to sign off on it. Tom, Tom, Tom.  You coulda been a contendah.",Mission - Impossible II

Believe you me, if you have any usable brain cells at all, you will find this film slow, slight on content, and unintentionally--I hope--hilarious (as far as the action sequences of the third act go). I mean, come on, the glowing, pearly white dove was ridiculous! The female co-star spent the entire film in career enhancing close-ups and slow motion. And the chicken scene on the motorcycles was laugh out loud funny. My friend had to hold his head down in shame once the movie was over, but I did not tease him. There was no way in the world that he could have known the depths of stupidity and hokiness that MI2 would go.
Was directoral control taken away from the Great John Woo or what? I most certainly enjoyed his THE BIG HIT (7/10) more, yet I did not even think that that was all the good either. But at least THE BIG HIT in no way took itself seriously. I found MI2 to be so obviously bad that I was ready to leave after the first ten minutes (and I never walkout on films).

358,jerzeygrl,It's all about the Special Effects...,8,22 May 2000,"They should rename this movie ""Mission Implausible"" and flog the script writer.  The premise of the movie is based on a woman (Thandie Newton) willing to risk her life & reconnect with her bad-boy, ex-boyfriend (Dougray Scott) for a man she falls into bed with (Tom Cruise) after meeting him just 24 hrs prior.   The dialogue between the Newton & Cruise is elementary school level at best and they don't spark.  See ""Thomas Crowne Affair"" for an example of great chemistry.  You feel your eyes rolling every time the lovers make cows eyes at each other before speaking.  Look for Thandie Newton's wonderbra - it only makes one appearance.  Director John Woo uses his magic wand on Tom Cruise and tries to turn him into an American Chow Yun-Fat.  Although Dougray Scott fairs well as the progressively greedy, besotted terrorist, it's Anthony Hopkins who steals the movie with only 6 minutes of screen time.  Ving Rhames & John Polson (Cruise's IMF team) have little dialogue - shame.  The best throw-away lines are by Scott...    The magnificent performance by Tom Cruise in ""Magnolia"" is not repeated here.BUT if you're a special effects, action genre junkie, this will hold you over till X-Men is released July 14.",Mission - Impossible II

I really wasn't expecting much, but planned to be open minded...and was pleasantly surprised.Agreeably, the movie did not challenge the brain or inspire deep thought, but it doesn't pretend to.  The director intended the movie to be exciting, fast paced eye candy and that is exactly what it was.While I enjoyed the first movie (it was considerably more intelligent and required that you pay relatively close attention to the plot), I found it a little dry, and with the exception of the train sequence at the end and the scene where Ethan breaks into the CIA Terminal room, there was little in the way of excitement and energy.MI2 got off to an exciting start, and the action sequences (including Mr. Cruise's impressive stunts) were choreographed to perfection by the talented John Woo - complete with all of his signature trademarks.Yes, we can talk about the plot holes, the incredulous,  impossible to believe story and the over-the-top, implausible action sequences, but did anyone really come to the theatre expecting realism from a summer blockbuster movie?All in all, the fabulous action, beautiful scenery, high-impact sound track and the mindless story proved to be 2 hours of guilty pleasure...and don't we all need that once in a while?",Mission - Impossible II
360,thedudeabides-2,Woo's magic doesn't quite work here,6,31 July 2014,"There was a brief period of time when John Woo was considered the most exciting action director in cinema. His over the top style frequently includes balletic gunfights, slow motion and martial arts which are easy on the eye. It can prove quite distracting if you're not prepared for it, but for those willing to go with it, there is a lot of fun to be had.Unfortunately, in Mission Impossible 2, Woo has seemed to have forgotten that stylistic action is his strongest asset, with a lot of the movie feeling overly long and dragged out. It doesn't help that the plot is a simple case of stopping a virus from destroying the world; not terrible by any stretch, but you would expect more from the guy who brought us Face/Off.Tom Cruise puts in a decent performance, convincingly pulling off the action hero look, but the same cannot be said for those around him. Dougray Scott, despite his best efforts, is a bland, 2 dimensional villain who really wants to be more diabolical than he is, Ving Rhames doesn't really do anything and Thandie Newton is embarrassingly bad as the love interest. In fact, the entire love story proves to be rather cringe worthy throughout, with a number of corny scenes and absolutely zero chemistry between Cruise and Newton contributing to a sub-plot which doesn't need to be there in the first place.Thankfully, when the action lands it is every bit as enjoyable as you would hope, with a number of breathtaking stunts on show; the most impressive of which sees Cruise hanging from a cliff face with nothing but his hands preventing a grisly death, and a fantastic motorcycle chase towards the end which showcases Woo at his best before an overly long fist fight dulls the experience again. There is a frustrating tendency to overuse his trademark slow motion, and a few 'twists' stretch the limits of plausibility but if you can overlook these flaws, you will find a fun, but forgettable, action flick.An enjoyable action romp which tries hard to be much better than it is.",Mission - Impossible II

365,JasonS-5,Total Disappointment,1,8 August 2002,"I usually remember movies for a very long time after I see them. I think its significant that I barely remember anything about this movie except that I didn't like it. As interesting and exciting as the first Mission Impossible movie was, that was how dull and flat this movie was. It just seemed like they strung together a bunch of the bits that worked from the first movie and gave Tom Cruise's character long hair and called it a different movie.
There was a plot, I guess, I think, maybe. I remember it largely involved Tom Cruise being in Australia. As appealing as the characters in the first movie were, that's how cold, and hard to relate to as they were in the second movie.John Woo's style of film-making appeals to a certain type of person. I'm not entirely sure what type of person this is, but I don't know whether I'm anxious to meet any of them, because every movie of his I've seen has been cold, mean, and violent. I think that the best way to sum up MI2 is this: Suppose you were good friends with someone. You liked their company, you shared the same sense of humor, and had the same moral value. Suppose several years went by and you didn't see him, then one day he turns up uninvited at your house. He acts like a total jerk, insults you, hits on your wife, and finally demands that you loan him money. That's how I felt about ""Mission Impossible II""",Mission - Impossible II
366,chain67,Top Notch Thriller,9,25 May 2000,"Mission Impossible 2 is by far the best pure action sequel to come out in many years. What makes M:I-2 so good is are the action sequences which couldn't be possible without the excellent direction of John Woo. Woo makes the most out of every scene, trying to squeeze every possible inch out of each scene. Tom Cruise puts on a good performance as IMF agent Ethan Hunt. Ving Rhames in top notch as Luther Stickell. Rhames surprisingly gets the best lines in the movie. Thandie Newton is also very enticing as Cruises partner and love interest. But the main acting asset of this film is Dougray Scott as the main villain Sean Ambroce. Scott's performance is interesting and riveting. Surprisingly M:I-2 has a pretty decent plot which never gets slow or uninteresting.

371,Pelagia,Dumbed-down spy flick,7,26 May 2000,"In comparison with the original movie, ""Mission Impossible 2"" had a much clearer, easier to follow script.  Whether this helps or hinders the film comes down to how it is interpreted by the individual in the audience; which excites you more, crafty plot and shady characters, or state of the art action scenes?The action and f/x are no doubt exhilarating, the best Hollywood money can buy, but the script follows the basic action movie plan: a good guy, good guy's buddies, a bad guy, bad guy's buddies, and somewhere in between,  the mentor who sends good guy off to adventure, and the attractive love interest that provides a good reason to buy the movie poster (Notice that Tom Cruise is the only person on the poster!).Now, this is an action flick, and therefore character depth and development are not necessary themes the moviegoer should look for, but ""Mission Impossible"" exists in the world of the spy genre, where nobody can be trusted and additional viewings and a good eye are required to catch and fully understand the plot.  This film was far too simple to be considered in this respect.The filmmakers do attempt to add some spice, filming in exotic locations with some rather well-done shot sequences, but there are some shots that are done poorly.  For example, typically when the director is going to order a straight-forward closeup of an actor's face, the intent is to draw the audience's attention in to set up an important scene.  Here, close-ups abound to serve only as eye candy or deliver dumb dialogue such as: ""Damn, you are beautiful"".As I stated before, this movie was produced with no restraint on the budget, but as many big-budget films tend to be, this one is beautiful but shallow.7 out of 10.",Mission - Impossible II

Let's cut most of John Woo's violent poetry to a minimum; after all, a PG-13 rating means more success at the box-office! And to make the film seem like a thinking man's action movie, let's pretend to do some ""character development"" in the first half by including a romance that shall grind the whole movie to a halt.""And here we have it, ladies and gentlemen: another soulless summer turkey that most people dislike and some passionately hate (judging by the responses I read on the net), but which nevertheless will make more than $200 million in America and another $200 million overseas.What a waste of talent, this movie. Thandie Newton is an amazingly beautiful woman, but there is no chemistry whatsoever between her and Cruise; their relationship, which is supposed to be the heart and soul of the film, is never convincing or passionate. Her character starts out interestingly enough, as a smart, sexy professional who could be Hunt's equal, sort of like Michel Yeoh to Pierce Brosnan in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"". Then she quickly dissolves into the thankless role of a girlfriend, whose main purpose is to act as a helpless hostage and be saved by the hero. Her facial expressions seem to alternate between two main modes: staring longingly with a seductive smile on her lips, or looking worried and vulnerable.Dougray Scott is an AWFUL villain. His accent is so painfully ridiculous, he overacts so badly that I couldn't help giggling from time to time. The worst thing, though, is that his character is sooo terminally dull. We learn absolutely nothing about his past or the motives for betraying his former employers. His scenes with Cruise lack tension and intensity, the kind of ""we-hate-each-others-guts"" feel that underlines the best villain-hero relationships. Hunt and Ambrose do suit each other in a way that both of those characters have zero personality and believability. Which brings us to Tom Cruise and his hero. Ethan Hunt has to be the blandest, dullest James Bond rip-off. He has no visible personality traits or quirks, no particular reasons to like or admire him, he's a nobody, really. He looks good and grins a lot, but that's about it. And as much as I like Tom Cruise and admire him as an actor, I could never buy him as a John Woo action hero. He's way too short, for one thing, and all his attempts to act all macho and intense brought giggles from me and others in the cinema.Let's see, who else? Ving Rhames is totally wasted, spending most of his time looking worriedly at the computer screen and cracking unfunny jokes. Anthony Hopkins brings his usual charisma and dignity to the role of Hunt's superior, but his classy appearance is too brief to save the film.Don't get me wrong, I know that most of the action movies are not about good acting, characters, dialogue or plot. They can be as over-the-top improbable as they damn like, I'm not one of those nitpickers who roll their eyes during some crazy action scene and say ""yeah, right"". But when a supposedly action movie lacks any tension whatsoever, all the weak elements come to surface more clearly. I can ignore shallow characters, dumb dialogue and simplistic plot, but I can never forgive dullness and the lack of genuine excitement. And M:I2 was DULL with capital D.Apart from the motorcycle chase which was pretty neat, there was no action scene that didn't remind me of another similar action scene in a much better movie. It even rips the original M:I's most famous scene, with Cruise being suspended on a cord. I suppose it was intended as a wink-wink reference, but it comes off as trite and recycled instead. There's way too much slow motion, and what's the deal with those constant close-ups on the face?I went to this movie with no expectations other than having a blast of a time without putting any pressure on the brain. Instead, it disappointed me on every single level I could think of. I give it 1 out of 10.",Mission - Impossible II

The stunts, by comparison, are somewhat restrained, the plot not as convoluted or compelling (even if the script is by the revered Robert Towne) and the acting is anemic, a far cry from the over-the-top scenery chewing of Nicholas Cage and John Travolta. Tom Cruise, as hero Ethan Hunt, has a presence but only the right directors can exploit it (Paul Thomas Anderson comes to mind) and Woo's interests are far from acting. The rest of the cast is comparably weak, including Thandie Newton, Dougray Scott, Ving Rhames and, in a cameo, Anthony Hopkins. With no personal investment to speak of, the film comes off as cold and methodical, designed solely for big bucks at the box office.

380,Tkbn3812,"Definitely improves on the first film, with better action and a simpler plot",8,28 September 2016,"Mission Impossible II, the sequel to the original 1996 film, is a definite improvement in many regards. While the general consensus amongst critics seems to criticise the weak plot and poor characters, it doesn't focus on the positives of the film, namely the improved action, a simple narrative, and a brilliant music score.Mission Impossible I is renowned for a lack of action, with focus devoted to developing a plot so complicated no one has a chance of following it without pausing to think about it. Ethan Hunt is about the only person who gets any proper character development, and the film feels as though it drags on forever and ever (the theft of the NOC files felt like an eternity!)But Mission Impossible II is paced better, with an easier to follow plot, more character development and a music score that is far less boring than that of the first. Maybe the first has a more engaging plot (as confusing as it is), and the action scenes of this film may be unnecessary in some regards, but these aren't sins to the movie, and for the most part it is entertaining.The film stars actor Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, who, other than a new haircut, brings back the same stunning character from the first into the dangerzone. Tom Cruise, also acting as producer for the film, insisted on doing his own stunts, and does a brilliant job of portraying his character.The story is simple, which for some is reason for criticism, however I view it as a positive. Hunt is assigned the task of recruiting master-thief Naya (Thandie Newton), for a mission to take down suspected mole of IMF Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), who is planning to release a disease, Chimera, and charge a hefty price on its antidote. In recruiting her, the pair form an intimate relationship, one of which will prove risky in regard to the mission. Having recruited the help of tech-whiz Luther (Ving Rhames) from the first film, and pilot Billy (John Polson), the four travel to the land down under, Australia, with Naya sent to infiltrate Sean's mansion in Sydney, using a method other than her thieving capabilities. It is this that bothers many viewers, as Naya plays a role no more than a romantic interest for most of the movie. However, there was only one major female antagonist in the first movie who did little more, so this is still an improvement.The film takes place in Sydney, the largest city in Australia. Perhaps being my home city I am biased, but it is great to finally see Sydney in an action film. However, unsurprisingly, the errors in geography bother me. There is absolutely no way the team would have landed in the middle of a desert, near Broken Hill, a town more than 1000km from Sydney, when arriving. out of the way to be doing so. It's moments like these that would make people think Sydney is smack-bang next to the desert; it isn't even close.I cannot see how Sean and Ethan get onto a semi-rural road towards the end of the film in the motorbike chase. I don't believe there is any such road, at least near to the CBD, though I could be wrong. It's also a shame the Sydney Harbour Bridge isn't part of the motorcycle chase in some way. However, this would have made even less geographical sense than it already did. There is also the fact that Sean somehow gets his car into Darling Harbour, which would have definitely turned eyes in a pedestrian- only precinct, but we can disregard this minor detail.The film can be commended for its romance, which while not perfect, is far better than the sloppy attempt at one in the first film. It also allows for development of another character other than Hunt himself. Sean Ambrose is a fairly decent villain, and is at least known for the entire film unlike Job in the first, allowing proper development of his character. However, just about every character other than Hunt could have done with more development.Action in this film is far better than that of the first. Combat scenes are much more engaging, including most prominently the motorcycle scene, and the theft scene is paced a lot better than that of the NOC files in the first. As mentioned the plot is far simpler, although there are many plot holes. The film's original cut was at almost 3 hours, which explains why many parts of the film do not make sense.The film features a score by Hans Zimmer who, infamous for his intertwining of electronic instruments into orchestras, brings a stunning rendition of the Mission Impossible theme, with electronic guitars and percussion that bring out the most intense action scenes.It's a shame more Australians didn't star in this film; John Polson is the only actor who plays an Australian in the film, who unsurprisingly has a stereotypical Steve-Irwin styled accent, and says the word 'mate' way too much. You'll be hard pressed to find an Aussie who actually sounds like that. While Richard Roxburgh is an Australian, his character Hugh Stamp is (apparently) South African.Overall, this film is a good watch. Perhaps the plot is simplistic, with characters who need more development. However, the action is far better, with the movie not being as close to slow and boring as the first. The romance is also greatly improved. Setting the film in Sydney, a city little seen on the silver screen, was a wise choice.This film is well worth a watch. Don't expect the best movie you've ever seen, but don't expect nothing either; you will be rewarded.",Mission - Impossible II

383,Gordon-38,An improvement on the first movie,8,25 May 2000,"As the credits rolled, my buddy turned to me and said loudly, ""John Woo sucks!""  I replied, ""Are you kidding?  That was better than the first one!"" He spent the rest of the evening making snide comments about the movie and generally being baffled by the fact that anyone could even like the movie, let alone think it was an improvement on DePalma's ""Mission Impossible.""I didn't have nearly as much trouble following the plot of the first movie as most people seemed to - but the sequel certainly eschews the needless complexity of the original with a fairly straightforward plot.  There are some enjoyable twists and turns, but everything remains pretty clear.The stuntwork and action set-pieces are better this time around, too.  The laboratory break-in is clearly intended to top the fabulous computer vault break-in from the previous film.  It doesn't quite make it, but it's still a great scene.  The climactic scene is a spectacular chase with some stunts involving motorcycles that are every bit as impossible as the helicopter-in-a-tunnel bit seen in the first movie...but nowhere near as stupid.Tom Cruise, as always, is an appealing hero.  Ving Rhames is entertaining, if not given much to do.  The real strength of the movie, I think, comes from having a much clearer and more well-defined villain;  Dougray Scott projects menace and spits bile with the best of them.  Also adding a great deal to the story is the presence of a real love interest - Thandie Newton is gorgeous, and makes a good partner with Tom Cruise.My friend with the low opinion of John Woo just didn't care much for the style of the movie - the characteristic touches that make John Woo a recognizable director instead of a journeyman who points his camera.  The slow-mo, the odd camera angles...I thought it made the whole package a lot more stylish and visually enjoyable than its entertaining but visually pedestrian predecessor.Neither ""Mission Impossible"" movie works on quite the same level as the television series from which they take their name - about all they have in common is the name of the secret agency that the heroes work for and the ""This message will self-destruct..."" opening.  But in judging the movies in their own right, they are pretty entertaining.And John Woo doesn't suck.",Mission - Impossible II
384,DaWeas007,Great Job Mr. Cruise,9,24 May 2000,"This second installment of Mission Impossible was great, but not quite excellent.  It had all the elements of a great movie, intrigue, action, suspense, but there were at least one or more moments in the movie where the tempo more or less lagged.  However, it should be noted, that those scenes which lacked Action or Suspense, made up in Sex Appeal with Tom's Sexy Co-star, thus cutting the lagging scenes down to ones countable on one hand. Despite the few lagging spots, the movie did have some key moments. With Tom doing the majority of his stunts, possibly all of them, that in and of itself was quite amazing.  Add to that the motorcycle chase sequences, the crashing 747, and the main Rock Climbing Sequence at the beginning and you've got some high quality, well timed, and overall great highlights.  Not to mention, to add to the overall appeal of the movie, John Woo directed it, who previously directed such hits as The Replacement Killers, Face Off, and Hard Target, three great action flicks.      In Summary, if you are either a Tom Cruise Fan, a Mission Impossible Fan, or a John Woo Fan, this movie is a must see.",Mission - Impossible II
385,NDanger,This is NOT Mission: Impossible,4,26 May 2000,"I gave this movie a 4 simply due to it NOT being a 'Mission: Impossible' episode. In the TV, and even in the first movie, it was more of a team espionage show, but this was just another action movie. One major flaw was the recruiting' phase of the movie, where Tom has to charm Thandie Newton into doing the right thing. In the show, and even in different parts of the movie, they always use IMF members with those patented MASKS to fool the bad guys into spilling the beans. So why did they fell the need to recruit' an outsider? Well, that give Tom more screen time and the writers an excuse to put a sappy love interest in the movie. Weak.  On the plus side John Woo's choreography of fight scenes is still superb. Too bad they're used in excess, probably due to a lack of an intelligent script.",Mission - Impossible II

Facetime and aura that Napoleon I might think a bit much if he were the lead & the executive producer.Sadly, the writers didn't have enough plot to end the film, so it is completed with a very over-done TV quality fight scene.

388,emverano,One Long Self-Indulgence in Narcissism,1,16 October 2001,"Hey, Tom Cruise.  If you are reading this comment, I want to tell you that your recent movie ""Mission Impossible 2"" STINKS.  Tom, you and your sidekick John Woo (who is reputed to be a very competent director) seem to lack any common sense.  In this movie, your character, Ethan Hunt, is virtually Superman himself.  He can shoot from a moving motorcycle and hit a target without any problem whatsoever.  He is a martial arts expert, better than Bruce Lee, Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme combined.  He is a great lady-killer, better than Casanova, Don Juan or James Bond. I was amazed that he did not fire laser beams from his eyes.  Ethan nonchalantly does super dangerous things just for the heck of it and succeeds without any problem whatsoever.  Tom, let me teach you common sense.  When a character is so absolutely perfect and super-duper cool, the character becomes very boring and tiring.  Moreover, after Ethan repeatedly puts himself in danger for no rational reason (maybe just for the fun of it), I became sick and tired of his self-indulgent, childish antics.  Even worse, Tom, why did this movie focus so much on your character?  It looked as if your character dominated all the major scenes in the movie.   I saw you so much in the movie that I couldn't stand seeing your face anymore. Tom, don't you know that the fun of any drama--be it a film or TV show--is in watching the interactions of different characters?  There is nothing more boring than looking at one face and listening to one person for hours and hours.  Moreover, because I saw you so much in this movie, I know what kind of person you are.  Your ego is so puffed up that you wanted yourself and nobody else to be acting in this film.  That is, you wanted all the other actors, even greats like Anthony Hopkins and Ving Rhames, to be insignificant bit players.  I remember the old TV series ""Mission Impossible.""  Using the name ""Mission Impossible"" as the title of this film is a total rip-off.  Your movie ""MI 2"" is ""Mission Impossible"" in name only.  Your movie has no relationship whatsoever to the TV series.  ""MI 2"" does not have the careful planning or the finesse of the TV series.  It is just one long self-indulgence to satisfy your own narcissism.  Many critics accuse your friend Sylvester Stallone of making narcissistic movies.  But compared to you, he is a paragon of modesty.  Tom, you are a peerless narcissist.  In the future, if you want to admire yourself, please do it in front of your own bathroom mirror.  Please do not make a movie for the sole purpose of indulging in self-admiration.  Your ex-wife, Nicole Kidman, once remarked that you love nobody but yourself.  Judging from the narcissism of ""MI 2,"" you must be madly in love with yourself.",Mission - Impossible II

I often burst out laughing during the fight scenes. Story-wise they do everything to make a simple plot look extremely convoluted, but it doesn't become any more intriguing. Don't even get me started on the female lead that doesn't really do anything, but apparently John Woo loved her looks so much that half of the movie is just scenes where they point the camera at her doing nothing.

This movie wasn't a sequel to Mission:Impossible, not a sequel to the movie or to the tv series. It was a Bond movie. They'd should've just gotten Pierce Brosnan to play Ethan, changed a couple of names, and there it is, another bad Bond spy flick. I was disgusted at the ridiculously overdone action sequences. The fight scene at the end is laughable. Many in the theater I was in left before the end. Perhaps the most disgusting part of this film is Ethan's love interest. This is what makes it most like a cheesy Bond flick. Ethan meets girl, and within 10 minutes they're all over each other. Her character was supposed to be an expert thief, but she ends up being the dumb damsel in distress. Her thief skills NEVER EVEN COME INTO PLAY AT ALL!! Even the cool gadgets and technology weren't interesting this time around. The  exploding sunglasses at the beginning that were shown in slow motion as they blew up just seemed so cliche. This is the worst movie to come out since The Postman or Armageddon. Don't see this one. Save yourself some cash and go rent a movie. Anything is better than this disgusting work.

Anyone wanting some more of the semi-cerebral plot of the first movie will be. As with all of Woo's movies, the action scenes here certainly do not leave you wanting. They are on the whole quite simply stunning. Is there anyone that can combine John Woo's ability to produce great action allied to such beautiful choreography? Probably not but there is pretty much where the superlatives end. There's a paper thin plot, poor dialog and actors who seem to be going through the motions. Thandie Newton looks stunning and should go onto to better roles and there's some promise as a Bond Villain for Dougray Scott. Tom Cruise had just begun to build himself up a reputation as a serious actor, while MI:2 doesn't shatter it, it hardly enhances it.

For one I'm a HUGE fan of John Woo films, and I really enjoyed Mission Impossible 1, but when I saw the preview it just didn't grab me and make me say ""I have GOT to see that movie"". But none the less I paid the $7 and checked it out.First of all this movie is NOT like M:I1, sure we've got Tom Cruise running around with a bunch of cool gadgets but the similarities end there. What we don't have is the intriguing and complicated plot of the first movie, in fact I thought the plot was fairly bland and uninteresting. We also don't have the shocking plot twists, yes there are attempts at plot twists but they're all way too predictable to be even the least bit shocking. It felt to me like Woo just tried to palm off all the twists with a bunch of mask scenes (you know the ones where you think it's one person but it turns out to be someone else), I thought the first one was good but I found it very easy to guess all the rest.However, most of the action scenes, although extremely unrealistic, were exciting and well done. You can really see John Woo come out in the action, particularly the last scene. There are tons of big, cool explosions, gunfights, stand offs, and slow motion effects. By far his flashiest, but not his best movie. A downside to M:I2 was that it had to be rated PG-13, most all of Woo's other films have R ratings which adds a level of brutality to them, and in that, realism. I found it took away from the movie to have such obviously far fetched scenes in it. I mean come on, you expect us to believe that two men can collide in mid air at a good 60 miles an hour, fall off a 20 foot ledge and then proceed to get in a ruthless fist fight? In reality they would be extremely lucky to be alive, and I mean EXTREMELY LUCKY!!! But who really cares, it's not like action movies are about realism, and by no means am I saying that Woo's other movies are realistic, but they were certainly more realistic than this one.So what did I think of this movie overall? Well, it's not bad. I didn't leave the theater feeling completely ripped off like with Battlefield Earth. However I also didn't leave the theater already wanting to see it again like with Gladiator. All in all it was a pretty average action flick, nothing really special like M:I1. If you're a big action movie buff I would say go ahead and see it, but if you want another M:I1 by all means steer clear of this movie because you will be horribly dissapointed. I give it a 6 stars out of 10.",Mission - Impossible II
397,Wolf30x,"Wow, what a bad idea.",3,22 June 2000,"If John Woo released this as a regular movie, it would have been okay, but the fact that he tried to pass it off as being Mission: Impossible is almost insulting. What is definitely insulting is that instead of being one of those clever movies you have to see at least twice to see what you missed the first time, (i.e. Usual Suspects, Mission: Impossible 1), its a bland attempt at a James Bond flick. Speaking of Bond, the villain was ripped straight out of Goldeneye, and even looks like Sean Bean, (Actually he's named Sean too). The opening car chase sequence was taken right out of Goldfinger. None of the cleverness or stealthness and espionage from the first one is left in this movie. In fact all that is left from the original is the masks (which are grossly overused), a rip-off of the famous Black Vault scene (which also has Ethan gracefully stop short of smacking into the floor,) and the theme song which got sampled into a Limp Bizkit song. In other words, don't see it in theaters.

The beginning of the movie could have been directed by any number of action directors, but the climax is pure John Woo.  All the trademark visuals and stunts are here, although the violence has been toned down to receive a PG13 rating.  The criticisms that Woo tries to turn Cruise into Chow Yun Fat are unfounded and started by those who have only seen Chow Yun Fat in Woo's work.  This is pure Woo.

399,scubergmu,How the hell did this movie get made?,2,20 June 2001,"(This is a corrected version of the review already submitted)   I wonder if John Woo or Tom Cruise, or anybody associated with this film is actually proud of the product they created?  Do you think they were all tied to some contract and had to make it, or some guys from the studio would come and cut off their thumbs or something?  I'm really at a loss on this one.      This was just about the worst movie I have ever seen in my life.  Now I'll admit, I haven't gotten around to seeing Battlefield Earth yet, so that distinction may change, but for now, yes, the worst.  This movie embodies all the things that are wrong with big budget action movies in Hollywood. To start, it was nothing more than a vanity project on behalf of Tom Cruise. Like a lot of highly-paid leading men, his contract clearly stipulated that he not be in the film unless his character is the ultimate bad-ass of all time.  Forget the fact that there was no character to play, he doesn't even need a name, Ethan Hunt, forget it, just call him ""hero"".  That's all there is to it.  And wasn't the ""romance"" of the film so well done as well?  I mean, he did know this woman for a whole weekend before he was madly in love and willing to risk his life for her, so it all works.     Then there's our bad guy played by Dougray Scott, who, like our hero, is so generic and predictable he can just be called ""villain"", nothing more. Like all action movie bad-guys, he's only interested in money, and he'll just keep on blowing up busloads of nuns and clubbing baby seals until he gets it.  And he looks just like Tom Cruise when he's wearing a Tom Cruise mask, even though he, like most men, is a half a foot taller than Tom Cruise!  But hey, its an action movie, it doesn't have to make sense.  Oh but there's more... The plot of MI2 was so weak and subordinate to the action scenes that most reviewers at the time simply described it as ""having something to do with a virus"".  Yes that is definitely the way to put it, there's nothing more than that.  But since they had to pay $20 million for Tom Cruise's salary, they couldn't afford to hire anyone who knows anything about viruses as a consultant. So we get a movie that's on par with Armageddon where realism is concerned.   I could write a book about why this movie sucked, so let me just try and wrap it all up:   The plot was almost non-existent, the characters were derivative, one-dimensional, and uninteresting, the action was over-the-top, ridiculous, and generally an insult to the audience's intelligence (particularly at the very end).  Oh yes, and I almost forgot, occasionally brilliant actor Anthony Hopkins was in a couple of minutes of the film, further revealing to us that he'll act in absolutely anything, just so long as the check clears.     To put it mildly, all people associated with the production of Mission Impossible II should be deported to third-world countries that do not yet possess the technology to make motion pictures so they can't waste 125 million dollars on s**t like this again.",Mission - Impossible II

The plot in this movie is smart but not as complicated as the last which is kind of good because the first mission impossible was hard to understand. Ving Rhames returns as the only other member of the original IMF team along-side Tom Cruize. This movie has good action sequences and is an enjoyable movie to watch.",Mission - Impossible II

404,Gordon_Six_Echo,Probably The Best Sequel Ever,7,26 May 2000,"Mission: Impossible 2 is perhaps the best movie sequel to come from Hollywood. The first one was a great movie on its own, but director John Woo gives the franchise a new look and a brand of action that the first one didn't have. I still love the first M:I, because Brian De Palma delivered his usual brilliance in creating high octane suspense. This may be one of Mr. Cruise's finest moments, since he does perform all of his own stunts, most of which I'm suprised he even survived. Dougray Scott is a chilling presence as the cold blooded villian. The final hour of the film is high octane filmmaking at it's best. M:I-2 is one the year's best films. Congratulations, Mr. Woo, you've succeeded once again!!",Mission - Impossible II
405,Waltdog,Not a dull moment throughout,10,18 June 2000,"When watching this film in the theater, not once did I find myself waiting for something exciting to happen because there was always something good going on, even if it wasn't action.  The movie was extremely action packed and had a good storyline.  I think all the cast gave good performances.  I don't care what anyone says about the movie, I thought it was tight.  The story was great, the action was intense, and it kept me interested.  I give it a 10.",Mission - Impossible II
406,kg22384,A perfect 10!!!,4,27 May 2000,"That's right, if you like explosions every 5 seconds, gimmicky ""plot twists"", horrible dialogue, unintelligible accents, and absolutely no surprises, then you will love this movie.  And to you, it will be a perfect ten.  But, if by chance, you like intelligent movies with skilled acting (Jude), stuntwork that pertains to the story (Gladiator), in depth character studies (Magnolia), gripping plot twists (Fight Club), or anything else that classifies as art in the film world, you'll probably give this movie about a four like I did.  It reeks with cliches, and unlike the first Mission Impossible, it has a scattered plot that never actually redeems itself.  De Palma used confusion and a variety of locals scenarios to pull in the viewer to a thrilling climax on a speeding train.  Woo merely gets Tom Cruise to do some incredible stunt work and calls it a movie.  Yes, the special fx are great,  yes, the motorcycle scenes were jaw dropping, and yes, who cares that nobody could screech to a halt on the front wheel of their yamaha and still pick four passengers out of a moving car with only four bullets in real life.  But, I've said it before and I'll say it again.  No amount of spfx, stuntwork, or popular music groups on the soundtrack can make up for a poorly executed plot. And on a personal note, I usually enjoy Hans Zimmer's scores.  He's very versatile.  From As Good as it Gets, to Prince of Egypt, to The Thin Red Line, he is great at crafting the music to the visuals.  But fresh off the heals of composing the score for Gladiator, so brilliantly referencing ""Mars"", as well as utilizing Lisa Gerrard for the ethereal feel of the supernatural, Zimmer seems to copy himself with a similar sound that cheesifies the closing of MI2 instead of empowering it.It seems Cruise (Mission: Impossible 2) does better with De Palma(Mission: Impossible) and Cage (Snake Eyes) does better with Woo (Face Off).4 of 10",Mission - Impossible II
407,dalbuc,"Dreck, Plain and Simple",2,30 May 2000,"Ok, MI2 isn't going to be high art, no problem. Sure it will have improbable moments, no problem. I can accept all of those features. Bond films fall into similar categories and I generally like those. MI2 is simply unlikeable. The plot barely exists as a meaningful feature. The characters are hideous- one wonders how much Anthony Hopkins needed a pay day to show up in this one. OK, fine so the plot is swiss cheese and the characters stink is a good action film? No. The movie opens with the use of the all concealing rubber masks/voice changers and continues to overuse them as a plot device. These masks, BTW, have the incredible ability to make folks taller/shorter, thinner/fatter and come pre-scorched so they are just right for any scene. The device is not only hackneyed but obvious in every use. The martial arts sequences are again boring. Woo loves the spectacular but the fight scenes seem more designed to show off Tom Cruise's whipping hair than any martial arts skills (which I doubt Cruise of the villian-actor had much of). The motorcycle chase scenes are dull but include: an obvious computer animation gaff where the cycle hovers during a jump, a silly wire trick for a front wheelie and Tom's cycle becoming bulletproof while he hides behind it?!?! There are, by my guess, 2 action sequences (one which includes the trademark Woo two gun action)and the finale plus one short and pointless car chase in a movie that runs around 2 hours. The rest is a lot of talking by characters you'll struggle to care a whit about. Skip it.",Mission - Impossible II

I'm just saying that it was really friggin' cool to see Tom Cruise do a slow-motion cartwheel kick on Dougray Scott's ugly mug.  Now, if you wanna see action this summer, go see Gladiator.  If you wanna see special effects, go see Titan, A.E. or X-Men.  M:I2 runs the middle line--a fair amount of action, and decent-enough special effects... but this is friggin' Diet John Woo here.  Watch something of his WITHOUT all the kind, sugar-coated PG-13 censoring, and you get films that exude raw power from every sweat-soaked pore.  Believe me, ""The Killer"" makes this movie look like ""Elmo in Grouchland.""  Not-half-bad state or no, grab a bunch of friends and see this movie, in a theater with a big screen and good sound.

However, MI2 is just totally cliche - a cliche action movie, a cliche John Woo flick. I think John Woo was much better when he made low budget flicks because he had to help the movie out with other elements (plot, characters); MI2 is all about style and Tom Cruise. Ok, Tom is great in the action sequences, but other than that, who cares? I wasn't excited, didn't want to cheer, or anything.",Mission - Impossible II

You know, guns, motorcycle chases, big (and repetitive) car explosions and the like. The story line is not bad actually, and I enjoyed it, left the cinema feeling entertained. The actors did a good job and I had no problem with that (but still, watching Tom in action mode makes me laugh!)After closer inspection, you'll notice that this movie has a lot of flaws...but I am not going there. The thing is, it is way TOO predictable. And this makes it less exciting. I mean come on! They won't possibly let Tom Cruise die like he was an idiot, would they? The whole part where Ethan got caught and unable to speak is just too ridiculous. Who would believe THAT was the real Ethan? So he's not. And he got killed by the villain. I'm not going to say who the poor bastard is, but his little finger got chopped off.

412,fatehsmann,"No substance, and not too much style either",6,16 December 2010,"For all the hype, the marketing, and the trailers and Tom Cruise, this movie fell flat on its face. Nothing in this movie is bad though. The effects and the action sequences are okay, though nowhere near to the level expected. The performances are okay, though Tom Cruise fails to bring about the kind of performance that would have catapulted him among the legends. This was the kind of role that would have shown,(as Thandie Newton said during the movie), that he's not just a pretty face, similar to what Brad Pitt did with his mind-blowing portrayal of Tyler Durdan. But it's not Cruise's fault.The plot and everything is average and the movie tends to drag and it has a lackluster feel in it. Forget substance, even the special effects and the action sequences are no where near the level you would expect. Ethan Hunt never really looks like a super spy. And you're never really at the edge of your seat. There are far far better movies out there..go for something else.",Mission - Impossible II
413,behemuthm,John Woo Fails Again,1,25 May 2000,"If you didn't enjoy Broken Arrow for its terrible direction, be braced for worse in Woo's latest attempt Mission Impossible 2. I thought the first installment of the two was okay, but as is the case more often than not, the sequel turns out worse. More than anything, Woo's style of slow-motion and extreme-angle shots would be cool if it wasn't taken too seriously. The music is way over the top (read: big music rise when man grabs a scarf...). The sound effects editing is equally as bad (a woman slaps a man in the face and it sounds like a 70s kung-fu kick). It would be fair to say that if you removed all of the slow-motion scenes in this movie, it'd be about 35 minutes long. However, Scooby-Doo fans will appreciate Woo's obvious tribute to lame plot-twists. This film is basically an excuse to show Cruise with wind blowing in his hair with a little smirk behind dark glasses (Matrix, anyone?). I don't care how many freakin' Kung Fu movies this guy's made: Every American film he's been involved in has sucked bigtime: Broken Arrow, The Rock, Face/Off, and most notably: Hard Target (poo!). Don't get me wrong: I wasn't expecting Shakespeare here...but there's no law stating that if you make an action movie, it has to be really unintelligent. Look at the original Bond films, for example. This has never happened to me before, but about twenty minutes in, I felt like I was in a movie theater, not involved in the story. I had to try to keep focusing on the screen and try to get into it, but I just couldn't. So in conclusion, if you like to be insulted as an audience member or feel like staring at a 40-foot-wide slow-motion extreme low-angle of Tom Cruise trying to be cool or acting tough, you're sure to get your eight dollars' worth. Oh yeah, an abundance of big explosions from three hundred different angles. Yawn.",Mission - Impossible II
414,havana-2,MI-2 John Woo Style....,6,25 May 2000,"Tom Cruise has now proven that he can do what Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee have done. That is, star in a movie made by a Hong-Kong film-maker. Clearly, the plot is not so relevant in MI-2.  Rather, what is important is the action and pace. In this addition (in my opinion better than De Palma's Mission Impossible) Woo wows us with motorcycle and car chases. Gun fights, and the inevitable kung-fu showdown on a cliff. Most of the action in the film takes place in Australia, and what the distributors are indicating with this edition, is that the films will end up being very James Bondish.  In other words, they will feature the cars, the gadgets and the hot girls.  This edition's hot girl is Thandie Newton (Flirting, Beloved, Besieged)  She is hot.  She is a great actress, but I don't buy her as a cat-burglar. (I didn't buy Catherine Zeta Jones as a cat-burglar in Entrapment either)  But she's good to look at, now that her afro is gone, and her accent is normal (she is Australian, but has played Africans and American slaves recently) The main weakness in MI-2 is the villain.  He is unconvincing, and not scary. He is too similar to Tom Cruise which makes the whole mask thing work.  (They use lots of masks, fooling people into thinking they are someone else ... ie. Face-Off)  But, it doesn't make the story work. Anthony Hopkins is terrible. He shows up to the set to get his paycheck, but he didn't add anything to this film, except for his knighthood. The score is better than the first, it features a cool guitar lick by Limp Bizkit, some cool trancy stuff by BT and the usual genius score by Hans Zimmer. Check this movie out on the big-screen, but don't expect T-2 or Titanic, just a good laugh, and some cool action sequences. 2 fishies out of 5.",Mission - Impossible II
415,paulmg,Better than the original,8,24 May 2000,"Though it's become increasingly obvious that the Mission Impossible films have little to do with the television show they're derived from, that's not necessarily a bad thing.This film focuses less on action and more on the characters than the previous entry; or, for that matter, most action films of this day. Some will find this difficult to swallow, like a foreign food that the throat refuses to accept not because of a bad taste but because of the unfamiliar sensation it causes, which is too bad, because it actually makes for a great film, though not necessarily the one viewers will walk into the theater expecting to see.At center stage is the romance between Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and Nyah (Newton), the latter a thief whom Hunt is assigned to acquire for his next assignment. Their by-play and chemistry forms the heart of the film, and the manner in which the rest of the plot plays out really depends on how these two characters care for and react to one another.For action fans, there are, of course, the great stunt and set pieces that one would expect, the majority coming at the end of the film. Those looking for a mind numbing experience with as little thought involvement as possible might wish to skip the first half of the film and go straight to the big finale. But for those who want a bit more from their action films, the film should amply satisfy. Recommended.",Mission - Impossible II

Yes, she has pleasing curves on her face, but quit jerking me with that stupid chain on my brain! There were virtually no clever twists, though lots of predictably pulling off fake faces.In MI1, Tom (Ethan Hunt) had to out-think his IMF boss. Here, he has to out-action his IMF peer, the mean one, whose body so closely matches his own, that their boss chose the villain to pretend to be Ethan.I try to suspend my disbelief, but how is it that a carrier of a deadly weaponized virus isn't contagious at all, until exactly 20 hours, which is also when the anti-virus won't work any longer. Are those supposed to be causally connected? What do they think viruses are?This is the John Woo version, and there is a lot of action, very fancy, both martial arts and vehicular, but I know it is only dancing, and ludicrous dancing at that, no relation to actual fight moves that might save my life. I also know that it will go on till they run out of imagination or budget and then resolve whatever way they want.

419,eagle_owl,A poor excuse for a blockbuster.,2,22 February 2005,"The original Mission Impossible film, starring Tom Cruise as agent Ethan Hunt was a pretty good attempt to update the 60's TV series for a new generation. Sadly the sequel has failed to live up to the modest standards set by its predecessor. Tom Cruise reprises his role, but probably wishes he hadn't.This is a poor excuse for a blockbuster, with dull characters, and a plot that only exists as an excuse for some mind-numbing action. Its style is heavily indebted to the Matrix, a sure sign that nobody had any faith in this franchise's ability to compete on its own terms. This end result is a film that never really establishes an identity of its own. There are one or two effective moments, but they can't outweigh the negative aspects.As if that wasn't bad enough, this is a John Woo film, and so we can't get by without a few of his trademark doves flapping about the place. I've got nothing against the doves per se, but they're ludicrously out of place here.The performances in this film leave a lot to be desired. Tom Cruise goes through the motions, Thandie Newton's character is unmemorable, and Anthony Hopkins seems totally disinterested, as well he might. Worst of all though is Dougray Scott's horrendously over-the-top villain.What you're left with is a very lacklustre and severely disappointing film, where only the action scenes linger in the mind, and even these are barely original. It only serves to make the original Mission Impossible look even better by comparison.",Mission - Impossible II

I gave it a rewatch today and I'm sorry but I still love it! Yes I will agree the others like ghost protocol and fallout are better. After this one they tend to get a little more serious. You got to know going in that you are watching a John Woo movie. I love his other films as they are classic action movies. That is what this is. If you come in looking for a good 90's style action movie then you are in for a treat. For sure this movie has flaws (like things like the tires on the motorcycles that change from street to dirt tires in different shots). Again...It's a John Woo movie and it does exactly that. Over the top etc. personally I like it better then 1. Yes it is classic but the first one to me is more cheesy and in my rewatch before this one it's dated. The 1st and 2nd one are almost different worlds as at 3 they go in direction where they are now.Anyway...it's easy to watch and a good action movie and still one of my fav mission impossible movies.

I was relieved to see a mediocre 7.0 user rating for this movie. Did this script really come from the mind of Robert Towne, the writer who gave us ""Chinatown""? Now he relies on jaw-dropping, lame-o cop-outs. Over and over and over again, he had characters peel off rubber masks to reveal -- GASP! -- that they were actually someone else! Give me a break.

Richard Roxburgh was almost as bad (South African or New Zealander? - never could quite work out what that accent was meant to be.) Tom Cruise has been delivering the goods for a few years now - but this was not the same character as the first film. I had flashbacks to Cocktail watching this poor excuse for a performance. And what was Anthony Hopkins doing? Did Henry Czerny read the script and decide he didn't want to play Kitridge in this pile of rubbish? Good idea if so. John Woo has not made a good film since he left Hong Kong - Remember the good old days of The Killer and Hard Boiled? At long last, Robert Towne is being exposed as the most over-rated writer in cinema history.

424,Lag2Deth,"Crude, Clumsy Letdown",4,2 June 2000,"I liked the twisty plot of the first Mission Impossible movie. This movie is very different.This movie has a paper-thin plot intended only to provide an excuse for action scene after action scene.Instead of plot twists, we get ludicrous latex-mask-impersonation scenes - lots of them. Any self respecting episode of ""Scooby-Doo"" limits itself to just *one* of those scenes.MI2 clumsily tries to throw in a little romance to spice things up, but it does so in the form of a simply stupid car chase/flirtation scene that's about as sexy as a poke in the eye.So all that's left is action. That's too bad, because the action, frankly, isn't so compelling. A lot of it is so overdone as to be laughable. And there's a limit to how much of this stuff you can watch in one sitting without getting a headache, anyway.And, just to make things worse, the spectacle and noise of the huge explosions, the car chases, and the gun battles is exactly the kind of thing you have to see in the theater to enjoy at all.

If you want to see John Woo try to impress everyone with lots of slow-motion shots and watch Tom Cruise over-act in a tawdry melodrama, go see the first half of this movie and slip out before the second half.

I can approach each film with reasonable expectations, I just expect to be entertained on the level the director presents. This sequel is nowhere near as entertaining as the first. All Tom too much of the time. Can you tell he produced it? It's all ""been there, seen that"". Dangling Tom, grinning Tom.    I loved Face/Off and liked Broken Arrow. I know John Woo can do it, but he didn't do it here. The ""face-lifting"" throughout this one is OK at first, but Woo allows it to get old fast. His slo-mo fight sequences are tiresome after a while. I know he does it well, but he does it so much here. One fight scene near the end is intolerably long and, yes gratuitous, even for a John Woo work. Believe what you hear, there is no characterization. I would like to see other things Thandie Newton has done, they must be better. Tom Cruise just, well, cruises (sorry). There is no connection between anyone on the MI ""team"". Lots of action, guns and fights? Oh yeah. And the music is good and loud. But the music is good.

After all, the heroes are supposed to do things that look impossible.  The stunts are supposed to be over the top.  And they were.John Woo lends an experienced hand to direct this action movie, providing an alternative to the expected.  Some scenes, such as the ""white dove and fire"" shot, may have seemed a little hackneyed, seemingly irrelevant in a film with little other symbolism.

430,Bronis,What a MASSIVE disappointment!!!!,2,25 May 2000,"Mission:Impossible 2 arrives in theaters with a thud.  A noisy, preposterous boom, which is louder than any of the generic car crashes, bomb explosions, and gunfights, contained in the movie itself.  I would've never thought to consider the original Mission: Impossible as a good or even marginally good movie, but compared to this installment, the 1996 film is a masterwork.  We can only hope that Tom Cruise and his co-producer Paula Wagner decide against adding onto this completely joyless series.  John Woo takes over for Brian DePalma as director of this big-budgeted turkey which I implore you not to but a ticket for.After an opening sequence that gives hope to the audience, even as it leaves us feeling unusually empty, the film almost completely runs out of steam before the halfway point.  This time around, taking the NOC-list's place is some stupid virus named the Chimera that could wreak all sorts of havoc on the world.  Topping off Cruise and Company's obstacles are the villains: a corrupt ex-spy (Dougray Scott) named Ambrose and his gallery of inept goons as well as the bigwig pharmaceutical company president (a wasted Brendan Gleeson).  Not even Anthony Hopkins, in a totally wasted unbilled cameo, can entice us to not be annoyed. Maybe Hopkins had an idea how bad the film was going to be and took his name off it.Then come the unintentional laughs.  And I cannot believe that a talent machine like Cruise, mixed with the usually dependable Woo can actually deliver unintentional laughs.  But the sight of a white dove leading the way for Cruise as he walks through a blasted-open doorway was almost enough for me to get up and watch Road Trip again. At least that film had action.What the film does have going for it is the always-reliable Cruise and his love interest, Thandie Newton.  The excellent Ving Rhames gets next to no screen time and had better become a leading man soon before he gets stuck playing uninteresting sidekicks (see the first M:I, Out of Sight, and Entrapment).  It's strange to think that a John Woo-directed film would have a love story as the only real attention-grabber, but Newton is completely ravishing and her chemistry with Cruise (doing his usual smirking and staring) is moderately successful.  Yet even this love story is recycled from Alfred Hitchcock's classic Notorious.  Other plot twists, if you could even call them that, I found myself guessing minutes before they happened. The amount of genuine thrills in M:I-2 are almost equal to that of five seconds of Frequency (released earlier this spring- see it if it's still around).Which brings me to the lack of originality in M:I-2.  Not only is the romantic plot lifted from a film made almost 50 years ago, but also the action sequences in the movie feel insipid and totally unfresh.  We get carbon copy John Woo martial arts fist fights and shootouts by. John Woo. In the first M:I, there were a couple of decent thrill sequences (i.e. the safe break-in, the train climax) yet walking out of the theater, I couldn't think of one exciting situation in the whole M:I-2 film.  Never before has slo-mo been so completely drained of its worth (which isn't much to begin with).  Also, is Woo blind?  We get what seem like thousands of close-ups of our stars in the first half-hour alone.  Most of his film work just seems rehashed and distracting here, which may be what happens when you put two inflated personalities together in what they both think is their own film.God save us from M:I-3 because we, the moviegoers, deserve more than absolute junk like this. How could so much time, money, and talent be spent on such an unentertaining, inane, and completely disjointed film?GRADE: D-",Mission - Impossible II

The plot is ridiculous, and Tom Cruise's acting is enough to make you want to hurl yourself from a speeding motorcycle over a cliff, shooting pistols in both hands, while explosions are going off all around you and doves fly around in slow motion.
If you like looking at Tom Cruise's handsome face and body, then this movie is for you.  You get to see Tom Cruise run around, do flips, shoot guns, climb mountains, ride motorcycles, take out whole armies of bad guys, and most importantly: ***smile and look handsome***.   I mean, even the people who wrote the movie acknowledge this fact!! Here is a line that the villain spoke in the movie:Sean Ambrose: ""You know, the hardest part about playing you is grinning like an idiot every fifteen bloody minutes.""Exactly! The writers think its idiotic too!And don't get me started on this whole putting on a mask that lets you look exactly like someone else bit(which the above line is referring to).  First of all, its impossible. Second of all, it is a HORRIBLE COP-OUT.  You actually lose the TRUST of the audience in the plot.  All of sudden, ANYBODY could be a wearing a mask and a voicechip, so you are uncertain of who's who and whats what! Any minute, you are expecting the henchman to rip off his mask to reveal he's Tom Cruise, and Tom Cruise to rip off his mask to reveal that he's Thandie Newton and Thandie Newton to rip off her mask to reveal she's TV's Jay Leno.  HORRIBLE.  I feel bad for John Woo.  I have a feeling that Woo had very little control whatsoever in the direction of this film and was probably pushed around by Tom Cruise and the producers to make it in THEIR vision.  What Woo needs to do is go back to his roots and film a movie in Hong Kong or China where he has ultimate control like Ang Lee did with Crouching Tiger.   This is definitely nowhere near his previous efforts in HK, nor even Broken Arrow. Watch ""Hard Boiled"", ""Killer"" or ""Bullet in the Head"" and witness the true abilities of John Woo.  M:I-2 shouldn't be counted.",Mission - Impossible II
432,Einsiedeln,"Pretty good, but...",8,30 May 2000,"... it could have been a bit more believable.  In the first film, adrenaline and action was sacrificed upon the altar of (dubious and semi-comprehensible) plot and (Brian DePalma's lackluster definition of) ""style"".  Unlike many others whose posts I've read, I didn't care for M:I-1. It was slow and unstylish, despite the director's desires... and whoever did the research for the Internet sequences fubar'd them with cheesy, low-tech AOL-looking images.M:I-2 had the style that the first film was missing.  Settings and technology in this film actually appeared to be slick-tech, and portions of THIS film where certain characters were breaking into high-security areas weren't handled in as poor a fashion as the first.  (Poisoned coffee? Sensors which don't register the sound of keyboard typing, which is certainly louder than a whisper?  And above all, being able to hack into CIA's security systems?  Has no one heard of a firewall?)  Where M:I-2 lost my suspension of disbelief was the numerous car explosions (those not caused by plastique, anyways), proof that all film terrorists must be buying their automobiles from Yugo.  =)For the most part, M:I-2 was more coherent in style and comprehensibility, even if (or perhaps because?) it was possessed of a simpler and more linear plot than the first.  The action sequences were better conceived and filmed (it amazes me that people can be impressed by the poor-effects, yawnable ""hook the helicopter to the train"" schtick).  Overall, Woo is a far more capable director than DePalma seems to have become (with his last three directorial efforts, M:I-1, Snake Eyes, and Mission to Mars being particularly unentertaining).As for performances -- Tom Cruise turns in a decent performance, for an action movie.  =)  Dougray Scott is fairly solid as the villain.  Thandie Newton is, well, passable as a ""master thief"", although I wish she'd had more opportunity to show off her skills instead of simply being a face on screen.  That complaint also applies to most of the remaining support cast, but then, they ARE supporting cast.  M:I-2 is definitely a star vehicle for Tom Cruise, but in my opinion it's a fairly fun one.My rating: 8/10.  But be sure to see it in a theater with good sound; it'll lose something on video or in a venue where the speakers aren't high-quality.",Mission - Impossible II
433,Auselan,A unique work of art,9,18 July 2001,"Mission Impossible 2 was not appreciated by the critics because it was not understood by them.  As the culmination of the action epic - where the symmetry, usually found in poetry, is embodied by the violence - most modern cinema-goers were faced with something wholly new.  The Western intelligentsia, still hung up on the 1960's false division of clever female creativity from brute male violence, could not appreciate the profundity and happy sanity which John Woo's action engenders.The film opens with a panoramic view of the Moab dessert in Utah, before slowly focusing in on the small pinprick of activity which turns out to be Ethan Hunt (Cruise).  As he struggles with the hot sandy surface of the perilous cliff face, one of the film's main themes is introduced: man's struggle to overcome fire and earth.  Fire and earth being, since Biblical times, symbols of desire, pain and, ultimately, procreation.  Yet the theme is not gendered: sometimes it is male, sometimes female.  The violence of the Spanish dancers, dressed in red with their viciously clicking heels and aggressively sharp  though elegant  movements, celebrate feminine strength and sexuality.  As Naya executes her robbery, the clacking of her heels on the stairs and her sudden pose against the wall mimics the actions of the Spanish dance, thus her union with Tom Cruise on the cliff face, as their two cars, pinned together, pirouette towards dusty death, unifies the creative energy of the feminine Spanish dance with that of masculine danger. They become lovers.Hunt is obliged by his master' to give her up  to pimp her  and thereby entrap the villain.  At this point, the theme of fire and earth mutates as the pain, rather than the desire of its fecundity is explored.  This is visually conveyed by the horse image which begins to dominate  quantitatively and as well as qualitatively  over the earth image.  Naya is described by the villain, Ambrose, as a possible Trojan horse'  referring to the danger lurking behind her desirability  and the next scene is of horse-hooves churning up the race-track: a sinister mutation of the rumbling castanets and clacking heels of the flirtatious Spanish dance scene.  Naya becomes a pawn as the film delves deeper into violence, and eroticism becomes secondary or is subsumed into the beauty of explosive male confrontation.  Naya becomes less important while the arch enemy, Ambrose, becomes more so.  There is nothing salacious about this substitution of a female for a male combatant on the part of Hunt: a Freudian interpretation, while being a valid exercise in risky thinking, adds nothing to our understanding.  Instead of the tender mating ritual of the car chase, we have the bitter sparring ritual of the motorcycle chase: the two are similar in that they involve danger and heightened passions.The full-frontal motorcycle confrontation is the culmination of the horse image: it is a modern day joust, where the horses have become machines. The animal of the horse is civilized or contained within the sphere of technology, just as the film  with all its technological innovation  masters and is able to express through it's artistry otherwise uncontrollable inexpressible forces.  Like the Spanish dance and the car chase with Naya, Hunt's action scenes have a primal, yet also cosmic, elegance.  When he is kicking his gun from the sand with a sharp tap-dancing manoeuvre, pirouetting on the wheel of a motorcycle, or spinning away from gun-fire amidst exploding glass and red flames, the paradoxical creativity of violence is suggested.  Explosions occur and the camera pans out to afford a view of their blast radius, dwelling upon  and thereby suggesting the beauty of  these scenes of chemical destruction.  John Woo, through these explosive images, reminiscent of the origin of the universe (the big bang) is thus able to suggest one of the central paradoxes of creation: how life and creativity began in violence.",Mission - Impossible II
434,rkreitlein,Stick with Bond...,5,29 May 2000,"I must admit, I wasn't too excited about seeing MI:2.  When I heard that John Woo was on board for this film, I had the feeling that it would be something that I've seen elsewhere, many times before.  I was exactly right. This movie reminds me of one of the weaker Bond flicks of the 1980's...cookie-cutter characters, the usual ""one man against an army"" action sequences, and a plot that you've figured out by the time you start wondering why you didn't just go see Gladiator again... (15 minutes, tops). Bond movies can get away with the action sequences, but you don't mind as much, since the plot is invariably better than what we get in MI:2.  I think Cruise did fine as the hero, but next time, PLEASE give him some more gadgets and a better plot to work with.  I wasn't a huge fan of the first movie, but I'd rate it several stars better than this effort.",Mission - Impossible II

The movie does slow down briefly during the initial meeting with Cruise and Newton, but once the team is assembled, this movie rocks.  Much better than Woo's other films such as Broken Arrow and the Replacement Killers and ten times as better than the first one although it was great also.Mission Impossible 2 also shows that you can do action packed movies at the PG-13 level and not have all of the graphic violence, language and sex that most current movies do.  If your looking for a movie with the ultimate cliff hanger (literally) and thrill ride action, you need to see M:I2.",Mission - Impossible II

438,kejava,Mission Unlikely but not Impossible,7,8 June 2000,"While the plot of this movie is pure fiction -- a story that relies on technologies and coincidences that boggle the mind -- there actually is a self-consistency at work.  Once you buy into the basic story line (which, for your sanity, I advise doing early on), the rest of the movie flows nicely, with none of the jarring ""now what was *that* all about"" moments of the original movie.  The story centers on a doomsday virus which Ambrose has stolen and threatens to let loose on the world.  Hunt and the MI team must retrieve it; to do so, he enlists the help of master thief Nyah Nordolf-Hall (Thandie Newton) who was formerly involved with Ambrose.  Of course, Ethan and Nyah fall in love, making an oddly believable love triangle when she returns to her former lover and current nemesis.  The inevitable choreographed clashes between Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt and Dougray Scott's Sean Ambrose are poetry on film. John Woo's movies always intrigue me; his films are perhaps the most easily recognizable of any of today's directors.",Mission - Impossible II
439,mg!,"You can fool yourself, but this movie bombed!",1,31 May 2000,"Ladies and gentlemen, this movie was bad.  The high-priced glossy marketing lured me into a rush-hour show that left me more disappointed the more I thought of it.  Only Tom Cruise apologists can only be so forgiving.  If he had run around a pink dress and clown make-up they would still call this work of garbage as a ""rockin' movie!""  The acting was poor as its premise. And I don't appreciate action scenes that rewrite the laws of physics.  Even those who would dare vote a 10 of 10 on MI2 would have to admit the story was lame.  (another inside job, oh the originality!), the end was per formula (with the villain getting what he wants but chases Cruise down anyway, uh why?)  And the Tom Cruise's s-l-o-w--m-o-t-i-o-n--c-l-o-s-e-u-p-s was just t-o-o--m-u-c-h!  Only those who want to see his gruntal facial expressions up close will appreciate it greatly (again with the pink dress). Here is my final summary of MI2: * story (lame) * love story (don't be fooled by the marketing, there was none) * action (summary: Cruise kicks, lands on back, repeat) * ending (yawn) * supporting actors (they took screen time away from Cruise therefore all but eliminated) * acting (Cruise with uncomfortable facial gestures) * direction (I Woo never watch any of his movies again) * taking of my money (very successful)",Mission - Impossible II
440,Bschorr,The first one was better.,6,24 November 2000,"Definitely a John Woo film, lots of good stunts and action. Tom Cruise gets to do even more physical stunts Woo does a good job with that. Too many holes in the plot, though, and too long a film for as little ground as it covers. The acting is adequate, could have used more Ving Rhames.",Mission - Impossible II
441,Joe S.,"A visual delight, though I'm finding few people agree",9,26 May 2000,"I understood the plot of the original movie, though it would take too many words on here to explain.  However, the movie was too locked into a European coffee-house look that may work great for an intellectual character study, but drains the excitement from a spy thriller.  What immediately makes this movie better is the location.  Australia is a breath of fresh air from most cramped in hotel room espionage games, though the conventional car chase and horse race present themselves here-and-there.  The plot is a bit simple, but then again, it isn't completely spelled out either.  Exciting action sequences are laced throughout the movie, especially one break-in sequence that while not having as large of a scope of the original's break-in, provides astounding visuals especially of downtown Sydney.  The parts in between may have been a complete bore (and to some, they were), but two things saved them for me.  The first is John Woo's visual style.  While some may say it's self-centered direction, the movie provides many stunning visuals to push the emotional levels.  A scene where Agent Hunt first meets a female thief who must be recruiting for the mission, the camera plays tricks with their gazes and the spinning of Spanish dancers.  While too flashy for some tastes, it breathes life into a scene that by any other director's hands would be simply two people looking at each other.  The second is Hans Zimmer's wonderful score.  Though sometimes falling to the ""give the people what they want"" flair of Lalo Schifrin's Mission:Impossible theme, the rest of score is surprisingly emotional.  Since there are some points that lack chemistry between the characters, the music is key to the success of the movie.  The sensual yet rousing themes make the audience care about the characters without pushing the them into it.  Put it all together and it's an exciting movie that kept me involved from beginning to end, even if the lack of just one of above elements would make the movie fall apart.",Mission - Impossible II
442,bornyesterdayandtomorrow,Bored me to Tears,3,25 February 2006,"Spoiler? Yeah, right. Like we haven't seen a movie like this before. I can easily summarize this movie by relating it to Mario Brothers (the game): Mario kills the inferior bad guys before getting to Bowser, then he saves the Princess, with the help of Luigi and Toad.Sorry, Tom, but this movie really made me sleepy. I mean, come on, what happened to make Ethan grow out his hair? Too much stress? The fact he thought that he could impress the ladies? I have no idea, but...this movie bored me to tears.Tom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt in this slow, dreadfully boring, Spanish guitar playing, stupid slow-mo, Spanish-British loving movie whose action is like...the last 15 or 20 minutes.For the first hour, the movie dragged on with some pretty corny stuff. Why would anyone slow-mo a car wreck? We don't need to see Ethan Hunt toss around his hair like that guy on Shrek 2, do we? No. We want action. We want the Ethan Hunt on the first movie. The one who runs, screams on the telephone, and doesn't have such a serious relationship. If we wanted to watch a movie with so much love in it (it practically revolves around it), we would've watched Pretty Woman or something. This movie is supposed to have action--but where? Only at the end? I liked the bad guys more in this movie--at least they knew it was supposed to be action.This movie makes me tired just to speak about it.If you want a sleeping pill, go watch this movie.

I am one of the few people who really enjoyed the first Mission Impossible. This is one of Tom Cruise's worst films.

445,rux-2,"Changing the meaning of the word ""impossible""....",9,4 June 2000,"From the very beginning it seem to be a good movie. And to be honest, it was. It`s is true....it felt like it was getting a little ""slow"" around the midlle of the movie, but that didn`t last for long. Before I got to write this, I have read a few reviews and a few comments by others....and I got to say it: many people don`t know what they want. The 1st M.I. was too slow, complicated and it lack in action. The 2nd M.I 2 looks like a story written for a 6 years old. PEOPLE, make up your mind !!! JOHN WOO  is the best as far as directing action movies. Has the talent for it and he`s very ingenious...and for ALL those people out there, who think that JOHN WOO ""took"" some ideas from ""THE MATRIX"", with the slow-motion, let me bring you up to date. The slow motion scenes in the movie, directed by JOHN WOO, are pretty much his ""trade mark"" or his ""signature""... ""THE MATRIX"" was nowhere when ""THE KILLER"" or ""HARD BOILED"" came out, all of them directed by JOHN WOO. So, think about it....If you`ll ever watch one of those movies, you`ll see the ""signature""....and even in JOHN WOO`s latest movies (but movies that were made before ""THE MATRIX"") like HARD TARGET, BROKEN ARROW, FACE OFF....you`ll see all that. Second: the two MISSION IMPOSSIBLE movies were directed by totally different directors. The 1st M.I. was the work of BRIAN DePALMA, one of the best directors when in comes down to thrillers and mystery. So, you got less action but more mystery. The 2nd MISSION IMPOSIBLE was directed, as we all know already, by the one of the best action movie directors: JOHN WOO. So, you got less mistery and more action. If you didn`t like that, you can go back and re-watch the 1st one and if you didn`t like the 1st either then maybe you should be watching ""ALICE IN WONDERLAND."" However, after watching the movie, I got the feeling that the ""masks"" were used every time they got to a ""dead end"" with the script. But that would be pretty much the only thing I could say against the ""M.I.2"" This is definitely one of those movies you got to have, if you a movie collector.",Mission - Impossible II

However, it was still a good action film, as one expects from anything that John Woo puts his name on. The final bike sequence, and the resulting fight between Cruise and Dougray Scott were both very good, but several sequences lacked the typical John Woo flair and originality that marked films like Face/Off and Hard Boiled. Still, it satisfied my desire for a decent action film. All of John Woo's trademarks were evident, from the slow motion photography (over used I thought) to the appearance of a dove (a trend started in Face/Off) to the odd religious reference, which were good to see, although a bit out of place at times.The acting was decent, the characters were cast quite well (Thandie Newton is SUCH a babe!), but the major flaws were in plot and concepts. As with the first film, MI2 ignored the whole team philosophy of the TV series and concentrated almost entirely on Ethan Hunt, Cruise's character. The other two guys with Cruise were merely helping him along, they lacked any real cohesion or sense of working towards a common goal together. This was a disappointment, as was the threadbare obvious plot. A major highlight of the first one was that despite the lack of a team concept, you couldn't tell where it would go next. It did confuse a bit, and have one too many twists, but the unpredictability was good. Not so here, every last 'twist' I could pick immediately, as everyone I talked to also did. Yet another Hollywood film that pays little attention to script, plot, or screenplay and tries to cover these shortcomings with pyrotechnics and stunts.

I Believe the movie deserves much better than that.First of all, the soundtrack. Hans Zimmer who has done another great job, again. He just is a master of giving mediocre movies an extra shot of blockbuster nonsense to make them watchable and enjoyable. There is hardly a denying that it makes scenes vivid and exstatic, in it's own way.The action was pretty good too. Coming from a master of action like John Woo, wo would expect otherwise. Who cares about realism if you got Tom Cruise racing through flames on a motorbike? I don't, at least.And the sidekicks were cool. Ving Rhames, Anthony Hopkins, they were all small but likable parts making the movie feel more comfortable.I would love to see the 3 and a half-hour, R-rated version Woo intended to release, but was thrown away by the studios because they wanted a standard PG-rated title. A crying shame, if you ask me, because you could certainly smell something of a classic through the silliness that had this movie.But I still liked it. I liked it because it was edited so energetic, so vibrant, with so much allure and elegance brought to screen, that it is hard for me not to like it, and I forgive them for a lot of his faults and plot holes for that reason.

Definitely stamped well and truly with John Woo's trademarks and the whole film has a lot more in common with Hong Kong cinema than with the original Mission Impossible TV series (well except for all the mask switching that goes on).The only part I didn't like was the way the big romance developed - too deep too quick therefore unconvincing.

455,alcalde,Good action flick,5,4 June 2000,"I've read a lot of negative comments about this film, and all I can say is: lighten up!This is a motion picture. Fiction. From beginning to end, it is just a story meant to entertain, which is how I rate movies. I go to escape my dull and boring life, and be entertained.Ok...so there were some scenes that require the viewer to work a little harder to achieve a willful suspension of disbelief, but what the heck...we do that almost every time we sit down in a theatre.Yes, I agree that Tom Cruise could have been replaced by Pierce Brosnan, and they could have called it a Bond film without changing another aspect of the film. And I would have been just as entertained. Hey...I like Bond!And yes, this film deviates quite a bit from the '60's (!) television show, and I'm sorry for that. It could have been a much richer film. But in comparison, I was much more disappointed in The Phantom Menace than I was in this one. Overall, MI:2 keeps it's pace, and aside from a plot device (you'll know what I mean when you see the movie) that gets waaay overused, this gets a 7/10 from me. Go enjoy! Oh...one more thing...It's worth seeing on the big screen just for the sequence in which Ethan Hunt is introduced.",Mission - Impossible II
456,macenblu,where was the intelligence of the first film?,3,27 May 2000,"I understand that I, as one of the few who truly enjoyed Mission Impossible, am in the minority.  The plot of the first film was a little convoluted and vague at first, but upon my second viewing (and the mulitple viewings thereafter) I realized that it was not the density of the plot that confused me, but the intelligence of the writing, directing, and acting, an intelligence which is scarce in film today.That said, part II has none of that.  This film is an excuse to watch Tom Cruise flip around, throw punches, silly kicks, and perform every gravity defying feat known to spy-hood.  Perhaps Cruise is making up for the fact that he hasn't thrown an on-screen punch since The Outsiders, and i cannot honestly remember him ever toting a gun onscreen.  Maybe it is a smart move on his part;  after all, he IS pushing middle age, and the body can only take so much abuse past 35.A few points of comparison between the two movies:TOTAL # of punches thrown by Cruise: Part I = a couple, Part II = too numerous to count;TOTAL times cruise fires a gun:  Part I = zero,  Part II = 50 gazillion;TOTAL number of explosions:  Part I = two,  Part II = 25 gazillionThe intelligence of the first movies was replaced in the second movie by john-woo-explosive-gun-slinging and a corny romance (with an unbelievably beautiful costar), with Jackie Chan-esque stunt replays, zooms, and fight sequences.  The plot is so simplistic that every single ""twist"" is blatantly apparent 15 minutes before it happens.If you want to see Con Air/The Rock/Face-Off Part II, see this film (i am sure everyone will)...but do not expect to be held in suspense by the story, the acting, or, and especially, the IQ factor.",Mission - Impossible II
457,General Comment,More realistic than Mission Impossible One,7,8 July 2000,"Well, maybe not.But who cares? It was good simple entertainment, even if it did sometimes resemble fantasy more than fiction.The film contained stunning action sequences. Most of these were a bit too unbelievable, though, for me to recommend the film as a classic. There was no tension, no suspense, but it was a nice visual feast for the eye.The female lead was not a particularly strong part, and Ethan Hunt had to do most of the world-saving single handedly. If I was him, I would definitely buy a few lottery tickets, because he must have a high luck quotient to have avoided all those thousands of bullets.The head of IMF was not identified in the credits, but I think it was Hannibal Lecter.",Mission - Impossible II
458,Lord_Fug,Oh my good GOD!,3,9 July 2000,"OK, first things first, this film is not a comedy...so why did I laugh more during its viewing than I ever have before in the cinema? Let me tell you:  The major point of sheer humour was the ever shifting accent of the main bad guy's henchmen (who's name sadly eludes me).  It seemed to drift somewhere in between Irish, South African, German and Australian (perhaps he's a really frequent flyer).  The acting in the film is sooo bad!  From The female leads drunken stumblings (signifying the advanced stages of a super virus no less) to Tom Cruises' senseless mugging and the most hilariously over emphasised pronunciation of the word ""Loo"" from my favourite hench-goon.  The plot is possible the worst I have ever seen (and I am including every film I've watched through MST in this) and involves more 'characters not actually being who they look like but in fact wearing masks' than should ever have been allowed.  This film probably took about 15 minutes to write!  So, why oh why did John Woo ever decide to direct it?  In a film with about 20 minutes of decent action in its 2 hours running time, why on earth did he think he could make it worth watching? Woo is a superb director of action movies but a lot of the slow-mo in the more sedate scenes just seemed unnecessary  and down-right pretentious.  The final quarter of an hour was superb however.  The 'battle on bikes' was great and the final fist fight was entertaining if not really that impressive in terms of Martial Arts.  But then again, as soon as the pre-credits action ceases, the film falls into a pit of irredeemable boredom where the 'plot' is 'explained'.  My god, its so bad they even seemed to be apologising for its lameness by saying lines like ""Couldn't be simpler"" after explaining away some massive development in a few astute syllables. Frankly, this film was always going to be bad, but I was expecting a a piece of entertainment saved by its wonderfully entertaining action (a la Broken Arrow) but instead we have a wonderfully placid, souless piece of garbage based on classic Hitchcock with a smattering of entertainment towards the end.  Even the trademark Woo double gun action looked toned down in comparison with the ridiculously great, tile splitting, plaster showering lobby scene from the Matrix!  Now that the world has the Wachowski's, Woo has lost his originality and unique talents.  We now know that there IS someone else out there who can do it just as well as he. In all, if you're a fan of MST, go see this film for its unintentionally hilarious appeal, but if you're after an all out action fest you're going to be deeply, deeply disappointed.",Mission - Impossible II

This film is a mess for me for a number of reasons. A cliched plot, similarities to James Bond, and OH MY GOD THE SLO-MO SHOTS. Right off the bat, this film is a drastic change from the first one. It literally feels like a 2000 film. It's got that lightning and cinematography of the Brosnan bond films. Speaking of Bond, this film is very similar to a Bond film. I mean, Hunt falling in love with someone? That just screams Bond. AND CAN WE PLEASE TALK ABOUT THE SLOW MOTION SHOTS?! They are distracting in this whole movie and they are really unnecessary. Something tells me that John Woo wasn't the best director for this film. The praise I can give the film is the spectacular action sequences that Tom has done himself! The score is excellent, and it's unbelievable that Hans Zimmer made the score for this film. Overall, it's a watchable film. It's just that it's 50/50 for me on this one. If this film was like the Brosnan Bond films, this would be the ""Die Another Day"" of the series.",Mission - Impossible II
463,M0KUJIN,"""Squeeze a Child by It's throat.""",1,4 February 2006,"Devoid of any sense at all, this movie does its best to insult the intelligence of any living human whom views it. It's the type of movie that leaves a 12 year old orgasmicly gasping, while leaving any rationally level headed individual with a deep sense of the ""MISSING TIME"" phenomenon.The original 1996 ""Mission: Impossible"" movie showed just how an intelligent (while yet entertaining) espionage movie could be made, without a single gun battle, although with several good break-ins and chase scenes. The 1996 ""Mission: Impossible"" was about sabotage, agents, betrayals, heists, set-ups, shake downs and the mission. The plot was intricate and intelligent. It had twist's and turns. The conclusion was great, the ending was great, and the climax was intense. By contrast in this sequel, probably the only people in the world whose heads move fast enough to plan maneuvers like the ones CROOZE improvises in this film are the scriptwriters. Let me speak to some of the far more child-like idiotic elements of this movie that just left me completely embarrassed, and certainly anything BUT impressed.In an action sequence, in which a lone Tom Cruise is gunfighting with the villains at a biotechnology compound, the bad guys happen to be perched underneath some barrels labeled - ""DANGEROUS, HAZARDOUS / MEDICAL WASTE"". So what does our innovative Ethan Hunt (played by Tom Cruise) decide to do? He shoots out the barrels and ""KA-BOOM!"" they explode, eliminating the evildoers in a single engulfing explosion.Now what exactly do movie producers believe constitutes medical waste? C4 explosive? Napalm? How does a barrel full of petri-dishes, used diapers, test tubes, dirty syringes, tainted glassware etc, etc, all of the sudden become an explosive weapon of mass destruction, that takes out a fortified enemy position? If so, can we please kill two birds with one stone and just drop hospital medical waste barrels from B52's in George W. Bush's foreshadowing war against either North Korea or Iran, and save our tax dollars? There are numerous other inane parts but the above example is illustrative of the movie's approach which is -- F-CK any form of a plot, believability and any form of common sense - full speed ahead on CROOZE appeal and CROOZE facial close-ups with flowing of hair!!!If you can deal with pointless dialog and non-existent storyline enough to appreciate some CROOZE action sequences and constant CROOZE scenery, and more slow-motion than can be found in the complete catalog of John Madden's Football Highlights Specials, this might be for you.Otherwise save your time, do something more constructive, such as surfing the net for.....""STUFF"".",Mission - Impossible II

I usually can sense dreck like this before I'm tricked into paying for a ticket, but the rock-climbing preview seemed to promise a cool summer film. It wasn't...the movie consisted of bad acting, inane dialogue, stupid plot, horrid music, annoyingly repetitive explosions and gunfire, actors who aren't half as sexy as they think they are, endless staged-looking car crashes, too many aerial shots of Sydney, and dumb rubber masks being pulled off half the casts' faces.

468,slam163,Mission Implausible: the new Bond franchise?,4,4 August 2000,"A handsome secret agent, beautiful women, fast cars and fight sequences, plus a megalomaniac with a fiendish plot to hold the world to ransom: sound familiar? Yes, MI:2 is squarely in James Bond territory. In fact, I couldn't help wondering if MI:2 doesn't amount to a conscious attempt to take over the Bond market niche now that the Bond theme - despite the reinjection of Pierce Brosnan to try to kick some life into the series - is so clearly played-out.In fairness, this is a shrewder idea than having MI:2 follow in the steps of the first ""Mission Impossible"", a movie that tried to be dark and brooding and merely ended up tedious and occasionally baffling. MI:2 is popcorn, but at least it seems to want to be enjoyable popcorn. Unfortunately, the director doesn't appear to have any idea of how to achieve this: as a result, the film simply goes through the motions for a couple of hours, and then gives up.Centre-stage, as ever, is Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt. Or is that Ethan Hunt as Tom Cruise? The distinction between star and character can seldom have been more blurred, especially since Hunt doesn't appear to have any kind of personality to call his own. When Tom Cruise performs the free-climbing sequences - Hunt's idea of a holiday - are we watching Ethan Hunt's idea of a holiday, or Tom Cruise's? Of course Tom Cruise is an actor, not a secret agent. But Hunt seems to have so little character, and so few defining characteristics beyond Cruise's boyish good looks, that to all intents and purposes they might as well be one and the same.Cruise, to give him credit, does his best. He smiles and leaps and kicks people and runs and looks nice. Alas, the same cannot be said of Anthony Hopkins, who appears to be acting in his sleep. (He was very nearly acting in my sleep too, but I kept my eyes open somehow). The spectacularly bad lipsync that plagued much of the movie is also at its worst in Hopkins' scenes: I felt as if I were watching something that had been dubbed from German.Thandie Newton is another disappointment. The casting agency were apparently given the difficult brief of finding someone prettier than Tom Cruise for him to act with. With the heart-breakingly gorgeous Newton, they clearly succeeded. Her early scenes also suggest that she can act as well. She has the makings of an extraordinary, memorable Bond, er, Hunt Girl. Given free rein, she could probably have transformed the movie. But her role simply dries up partway-through, leaving her little more to do than look hurt and vulnerable for the rest of the film. It's a terrible waste.'Wasteful' would be a good description of the film as a whole. It's as if the director knows that he won't be asked to direct MI:3, so he's using up all the cliches in the genre while he has his hand on the clapperboard. If the MI series is the new Bond, it's peaking early: two films into the series, it's already fallen into the formula rut. It's also sloppily done: the 'need-to-know' information about the virus is repeated over and over to make sure we've got it (clue for Hollywood: audiences aren't as stupid as you think they are). The trademarks - Hunt dangling from a rope as in the first movie, and John Woo's pigeons - are fairly trowelled on, and the plot-holes come thick and fast. Most irritating of all, the 'face-mask' gimmick, where characters pull off a latex mask to reveal that they are actually someone else, is repeated over and over, without rhyme or reason. To use this trick once tests the audience's ability to suspend disbelief already: to use it as often as MI:2 does, in such implausible circumstances, is sheer laziness. After a while, you're all but expecting Thandie Newton to rip off her face-mask and reveal that she's actually Anthony Hopkins.Unfortunately, MI:2 takes itself too seriously for that: the only moment when it comes close to self-parody is when villain Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) gives a sardonic commentary on Hunt's plans to infiltrate a building. For the rest, there's little humor in the film (and several of the scarce jokes come across as oddly misogynistic). Tom Cruise's po-faced Hunt can never deadpan the way Bond would, which is bad news for the series: now that Bond movies have become thoroughly formulaic, the occasional dry wit is one of the few redeeming devices they have left. If MI:2 can't even manage that, future sequels will have little to recommend them.Unfortunately, car chases and explosions are no longer enough. Despite all the pyrotechnics and the slow-motion aerial kung-fu, the one truly vivid scene in the film remains the rock-climbing sequence at the start. Without any need for quick-fire action, with no enemies except gravity to fight, it's nonetheless genuinely tense and gripping. If Woo could have offered more scenes like that, MI:2 might have been superb. Alas, it's a solitary high-point: nothing else in the film ever attains that level again.If Mission Impossible wants Bond's crown, tarnished and tired as it is, the makers will need to do better than this. Simply repeating the usual cliches with nicer photography and a bigger special effects budget won't cut it, no matter how cute Tom Cruise may be. If ever there was a series in need of a new direction and some original ideas, this is it.",Mission - Impossible II
469,hollywood2k2,Overall an entertaining picture,7,11 June 2000,"So maybe the story was cliche and not too original. Maybe it wasn't Tom Cruise's most thoughprovoking film (but IMO it was a lot better than ""Eyes Wide Shut"") but ""Mission: Impossible 2"" was well worth my money. First in its defense, this movie falls under the action genre, which isn't known for it's deep philosophical dialouge or art house directing. You go to an action movie for the action and this movie had plenty. This movie was probably my most anticipated movie because it combined the talent of Tom Cruise and John Woo.John Woo in his own right is a god among directors. He's totally changed the face of the action film in Hong Kong and now the US. Maybe his US films didn't have the world's best stories (i.e. ""Broken Arrow"" or ""Hard Target"") but they didn't fail in the action department. I think ""Face/Off"" had a better story but it lacked in the action area. His presence is even felt in the films that he just produced (""The Big Hit"" and ""The Replacement Killers""). I'll admit that the only truly entertaining parts of the movie was the final 1/3 of the film, but then again that's what I went to the movie for.Tom Cruise is one of Hollywood's most popular, talented, and underrated actors today. He's been nominate for the coveted Oscar three times and each time he's been snubbed. I'm just praying for the day he's work is appreciated with the time honored golden statue. I think this movie was a good move for Cruise in more ways than one. First, it shows that he has no problem making sequels like some actors do. Second, it proves that he's a multi-layered actor. He can work in a drama, comedy, love story, and now an action movie (and yes I know he proved that in the first ""Mission: Impossible). It's important to find an actor who has more than one role and Tom Cruise is one of those actors.All in all I was entertained with the film. It wasn't a thought provoking drama but it was an action packed John Woo film, enough said.",Mission - Impossible II
470,ekwillow,An overrated sequel,7,13 January 2001,"This movie was extremely overrated from the praise it got.  I was really looking forward to this when I paid three bucks to rent it and now I wished I never rented it.  Most of the movie was boring,  except the last 40 minutes,  and like the original it was confusing.  Only the original was a little enjoyable with some of the action it had. 	This sequel was hyped to be an awesome action movie with non-stop action and I thought it would have a lot of action because John Woo was directing it.  But as usual the previews lie.  Even though the last 40 minutes were non stop action the rest of it was confusing and boring.  I know I shouldn't count the action for this movie being bad but maybe a little more action would've made it better since it was so boring. 	This is why I hate Tom Cruise because he's made so many overrated movies in his career (Jerry Maguire,  Risky Business,  Eyes Wide Shut, etc.)  And I don't even think hes that great of an actor because it seems like he plays the same character in every movie. 	If you wanna watch this movie for the ""non-stop"" action then you shouldn't waste your money on it.

471,Agaric,Average in all respects,5,11 January 2004,"WARNING: May Contain Spoilers     John Woo excels at pushing the envelope of both excitement and hyperbole in action films, but he doesn't handle emotion very well. Although certain scenes in ""Mission Impossible II"" don't fail to dazzle the explosion craving psyche, the entire movie has a hopelessly contrived foundation.  The characters are cliches, the plot recycled, and the dialogue is hammy as it comes.  A revelry of stuntwork, explosions and chases, but nothing more.     Tom Cruise gives his good looks, but not much else to the role of Ethan Hunt.  Whereas the original Mission Impossible contained intelligence and mystery, Cruise is forced to work within the slap-bang action hero mold. Dougray Scott is the typical insidious ex-secret agent turned renegade.  His overpunctuation of his lines is grievously apparent, and his one dimensional character practically telegraphs his direction and fate.  Thandie Newton, although extremely beautiful, is reduced to the ""hold me, hero"" love interest role for Tom Cruise.  Her character starts out as a highly capable and interesting professional thief, but degrades very quickly.  I don't even know why Anthony Hopkins was in this movie, but his role was tiny enough that it doesn't need to be discussed.     The plot is blatantly recycled.  A deadly virus is created and bad guys steal it, prompting a secret agent to be sent in order to get it back.  The scenes proceed in a stop/go fashion to the extreme, and hardly any tension is produced at all.  The chase scenes, though visually pleasing are predictable and rather over-the-top.  I'm normally not such a cynic when it comes to action movies, but couldn't any idiot in his right mind have hit Cruise with at least one bullet?  The kill ratio must have been about 80-0.     On the positive side, the locations were actually quite excellent.  The opening scene with Tom Cruise in the Moab Desert, dangling from a cliff face hundreds of feet high was very striking.  Also, the Spanish flamenco and candle-lit procession scenes exhibited very impressive lighting techniques. Woo's action sequences, though hideously hyperbolic at times, still display a degree of art.  In interviews, Woo has said that he retains some romantic visions in his films, such as how the motorcycle duel between Cruise and Scott mimicked a jousting competition between medieval knights.  I'm not about to challenge his contention, but he certainly has done better in his other films.     In sum, this movie isn't bad, but it's certainly not good.  Its simple plot, mega star actor, and flashy effects were enough to make it a blockbuster in 2000, but certainly not enough to make it memorable.  If you're an action fan, you could give it a rent, but there are many other fine action films which are more deserving of your view.",Mission - Impossible II

John Woo is stuck in the 80's, when will people see this. When cars bump into each other they explode and somersault. The good guys are excellent marksmen but the baddies can't hit a thing. The good guys can take a bullet in the fuel tank and keep on truckin' but guess what ? the bad guys find their car exploding, etc. etc. etc. I won't list other ridiculous, cliched moments, but I'm sure you'll recognize most of them from the A-team. That's probably where the writers found the plot too. It's so insulting.All of John Woo's films also turn into a single goodie against a single baddie, the rest of the cast turn into ornaments.

474,MrKearns-2,Don't knock it til you've seen it.,8,29 May 2000,"While many moviegoers will simply pass over Mission: Impossible 2 simply because it is another classic of the summer blockbuster genre, they will be missing out. Critics won't love this film, but they won't be able to claim that they absolutely hated either. Movie fans, and especially Tom Cruise fans, on the other hand, will find themselves seriously involved in it.Most of the discussion of this film has been a contrast to the original, Brian De Palma directed Mission: Impossible. In doing so, the point is probably missed. The difference between the films is more than just stylistic directorial difference, it is an entire genre switch. While the first MI might have passed for an action movie occasionally, it was primarily trying to be Sneakers (1992) starring Tom Cruise--a techno-thriller.When it came to Mission: Impossible 2 on the other hand, director John Woo was made aware that no one really wants to see Tom Cruise hacking at a computer. If anyone has to, it will be a character whom we experience only as a computer hacker--enter the other holdover from the original film-- Ving Rhames.Generally, there are moments when Mission Impossible 2 falls on its face. Tom Cruise and Thandie Newton seem to fall in love instantaneously, and so deeply that both would sacrifice their lives over a one-night stand. That simply reeks of convenience on the part of screenwriter Bob Towne, though the simplicity probably pays off in the end. The fact is that people who will enjoy Mission Impossible 2 aren't particularly interested in seeing a romance, and that's why this one is such a whirlwind effort.There are certainly other flaws, such as a repetitive use of the ""mask peeling"" that we saw overdone in the first film. It is used at every opportunity in this film, to the point that you almost expect everyone to be someone else, but, after all, John Woo made an entire film out of the idea (Face-Off), so should we really be surprised?The film is carried by a couple dynamic performances, a pounding score, and some Matrix-like action sequences that make everything worthwhile. Though the story is formulaic to the nth degree, in the end, it doesn't matter. Mission: Impossible was never about character depth and biting wit, it was about action and suspense. John Woo has brought these to MI2.Cruise, as usual, is effective, though probably too likeable to be real. Admittedly, he has taken a step down from some deeper performances in Eyes Wide Shut and Magnolia, but, frankly, it only makes sense. If it weren't for films like Top Gun, Days of Thunder, and the like, Scorsese, Kubrick, and others probably never would have heard of Tom Cruise.On its own merits, Mission Impossible 2 would get 4.5 stars out of 5 for the action genre. However, if we are basing it on quality of film, it would have to drop to a 3.5.

Every ""twist"" is seen in advance, every little crazy action sequence (excluding the cool hand-to-hand, which is obviously Woo's forte in that he makes Tom Cruise look like Bruce Lee) could have been scripted by anyone who has seen multiple Bond films, and every string tied to the romantic storyline is too sappy to be real.  The writers are obviously too used to half-hour storylines, and the director too good at Hong Kong action flicks to reduce himself to this trash.  Even the remade theme song deserves a knockdown.  I'm sorry people, but this movie sucks. Go watch the first one again, and don't bother with this lackluster attempt at filmmaking.",Mission - Impossible II
477,neo_jenner,"Not as good as the first, but John Woo saves it from mediocrity.",7,15 May 2000,"MI2 is a mixed bag. Overall, yes, it is a great movie. But compared to the first Mission Impossible or John Woo's Face/Off, it doesn't hold up. What hurts MI2 more than anything is the script. The threat of a super-virus is not only laughably lame, but about five years out of date. Also imbedded in the story is a romance between Ethan Hunt and a master thief named Naya that is particularly straining. Essentially, MI2 became a James Bond movie, but even the relationships presented in Bond movies never seemed this serious from the get go. There's even a scene where Cruise says to her ""Stay alive no matter what!"" as if it were ripped right out of Last of the Mohicans.Also, none of the supporting characters ever get a chance to grow. In the first MI, each character was fleshed out terrifically were in MI2 they simply stand by and watch Tom Cruise do everything. I think the only reason Ving Rhames is in this is because he was in the first one. MI was subtle, smart, and suspenseful. MI2 is loud, and over the top.So what was good about it. Trust me, after the hour long exposition, you will forget about every complaint I've said because the action that takes place is simply breathtaking. Visually, this is Woo's most stunning work so far and just as he did with Broken Arrow, Woo saves the movie with style over substance. The final motorcycle chase is flat out jaw dropping. All of the shoot-outs are staged to perfection and you won't even notice that PG-13 rating hampering Woo's style at all. If you've ever yearned to see several slo-mo shots of Tom Cruise walking/riding/jumping through flames, your prayers have been answered.However when it's all over, it just won't seem right. The original was unique in its ability to hold back from blowing everything up. In MI2 there is no holding back. And while that's okay to an extent, sometimes great tension and suspense can be a better payoff than ten-thousand bullets destroying everything in site.",Mission - Impossible II

Sure, the action scenes are great in that classic John Woo, ultra-choreographed way, but the plot isn't original or have much to it. Dougray Scott tries as the villain, but he's not scary at all, just sort of mildly irritable. After all, this is a villain who demands stock options as part of his bounty. (Truly, a sign of the times, and the audience laughed at that one.) Thandie Newton, who I had never seen before, is certainly beautiful, but she carries two expressions on her face through the entire movie, and resembles Ally McBeal in a tighter T-shirt. And then there's Tom. His character is more of a James Bond clone than the character is the original movie; I admire his guts and fearlessness for doing several scenes (especially the opening one), and the truth is, he's not bad.

Out of all the mission impossibles this i =s my favorite one, and tell you why. Let's start by the director John Woo who made action epics like Hard boiled, The Killer, Face/off,Hard Target and Red Cliff. This guy has a way of making action films seem more beautiful with the doves slow-motion . The soundtrack of this movie is by far the best out the entire series and Hans Zimmer did a great job mixing rock tunes that fit best for the scenes. The action sequences in here are pretty impressive for it's time, and consists of using stuntmen/Tom Cruise. I doesn't slow down for a bit and even if it does the story will keep you gripped. When I first saw this movie when I was a little kid back in 2002 and I was so amazed and scared at the fact the disease in here called Chimera can cause the blood cells inside us to deteriorate.

Mr Cruise and Mr. Woo should have hired a much more competent documentation team, and art direction team too. This is not a documentary about European traditions, but after watching this I can imagine a director from another ""undocumented"" country imagining a XXI century US where main cities has no skycrapers but small wood-made buildings, and a saloon with ignorant cow-boys riding on horses instead cars,thinking the earth is flat, and treating all bearded arabic people wear as terrorists.Moreover that stupid constant in Hollywood movies showing Spain as an undeveloped thir world country and its inhabitants as Latin Americans or Africans instead Mediterranean Europeans is somewhat funny, because it probably means that Hollywood thinks that the rest of the world thinks Spain is part of the Caribbean, Latin America, Africa or Atlantis (yes Atlantis, it exists it has borders with Syldavia .... )Thandie Newton looks African, not Spanish, many guys here probably are wishing more Spanish women were like that, but no, poor guys, here all women look so European....Anyway who cares, don't you think so?. Many spectators in Spain did not care too, some just watched this part astounded, some other could not help to start laughin and some (a few) felt indignant.

493,Chris-448,The behemoth of average action movies,4,22 July 2000,"This movie was one of the most hyped of the year, so perhaps that was why, on leaving the cinema, I was considering how appalling it was. The acting was reasonably convincing, which probably threw the whole saga an enormous lifeline, but the plot and stunts were ridiculous. Director John Woo slowed every stunt down to slow-motion, which was annoying the first time and inane from then on. Woo did bring some memorable set-pieces to the movie that will probably be spoofed time and time again, but these gains were bombed out of the water by the most ridiculous script I have ever seen.The plot was lifted straight out of a Bond movie, except that this film had none of what makes James Bond such an engrossing action hero. Dramatic stunts are supposed to astound the audience, not make them mutter, ""yeah right,"" under their breath. Why did the whole story revolve around face masks (a rip off of ""Face/Off,"" surely?). Why does the IMF have to shoot missiles at Cruise while he's scaling cliffs? Why does a truck, after smashing into and destroying a car, keep on driving? Why is one of Cruise's assistants prevented from escaping from a bomb because some small wires gnaw at his coat? Why does Cruise wait so long to destroy the last sample of Crimera? I was laughing at this film because, despite its gloss and its questionable Bond-by-numbers format, its essence (perhaps apart from the rock-esque soundtrack) was farcical.To be fair to M:I-2, the actors were pretty much top-notch. Cruise obviously fitted the role well seeing as the whole movie seemed to be made for him, but Dougray Scott and newcomer Thandie Newton (who was, sadly, reduced to portraying a stereotypical ""damsel in distress"") were both excellent. Sir Anthony Hopkins added his unique talent too, and grabbed the best line in the movie: when Cruise complains that Naya is untrained and shouldn't go with him on his mission, Hopkins replies, ""To go to bed with a man and lie to him? She's a woman; she's got all the training she needs."" But the characters managed at least to interact with one another, which counts for a lot in action movies were it is usually only the most muscular or robotic actors who are allowed in.So, some fine actors let down by miserable direction and some appalling goofs and plot holes as large as the Black Hole of Calcutta. That is what ""Mission: Impossible 2"" is. This movie is worth seeing simply because of what it is, but if you're looking for something with sophistication, humour and a touch of class, don't bother. This only manages a feeble 4 out of 10.",Mission - Impossible II
494,DaveyScan,Cheesy James Bond Rip-Off... Indeed very cheesy.,3,29 May 2000,"Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to suffer this movie. It's not mission hard, it's mission impossible.The plot is stupid, in hockey we use the expression, leaving the puck behind, in this movie they left the plot behind after the first 20 minutes. The action sequence are good, until the 20 minutes long look-at-me-killing-everyone-on-my-bike where John Woo show off why he sucks, and Tom Cruise ego is the only thing quite unmatchable. It's cool, then it's enough, then it's too much, then it's lame, then it gets very bad, then (spoiler) Ethan Hunt kicks his gun out of the sand to kill someone pointing a gun-- on his back!??! Good ol'e cheesy 80ies style. Two words: Way off. The directing is clever, but sometimes it seemed forever before the editing would cut a scene. And what about the slow-motion every 10 minutes, it's over-used. Woo should stay in Hong-Kong if he is proud of this movie. It's not even as good as Broken Arrow. The only thing this movie has is its truly cool villain. He is young, lethal and has fire in his eyes. Scott is the only cool guy in the movie. Sir Anthony Hopkins makes a cameo.I give this movie a 25% (3/10) (Stick with the original)P.S. Mission Impossible is about a team doing something without attracting any attention.

495,jonie v.,a dazzling but flawed film,9,8 June 2000,"Let me say straight out that John Woo's cinema has the power of filling me with positive glee. His images are simply dazzling, his choreography is exhilarating and his style is poetic. Having said this, I'm going to say what's wrong with M:I-2. First of all, the script is quite lame and the plot predictable. Secondly, some of the violence is so uselessly in-your-face and so protracted that I felt, more than disgusted, bored. Third, this film is clearly ALL Tom Cruise, which means that the supporting characters shine with futility, ineptitude, and insignificance. Fourth, the sexual politics are SO BAD: damsel is sexually exploited, pathetically ineffective, helplessly vulnerable, and in desperate need of rescue. Yuk.
In spite of all this, some of the scenes are filmed so beautifully, I gasped. The beginning scene in Utah, for instance: fantastic. The car chase between Tom Cruise and Thandie Newton, which transmutes into a tango dance: immensely creative and sensual. The motorcycle chase towards the end: breath-taking. Also, John Woo manages to capitalize beautifully on Tom Cruise's amazing screen charisma, to stunning effect. And he bends the M I trademark mask pealing to his penchant for identity swapping (see Face/Off, which could be the title of this film too), introducing some valuable thought-provoking elements into a script that doesn't seem to offer any to start with. Finally, I ALWAYS enjoy the bird/dove scene, a John Woo signature that expresses redemption and beauty magnificently. Terrific cinematography and amazing stunts. So, in conclusion, I loved this film. And I'll go see everything John Woo does. But he should try to work on his female characters.",Mission - Impossible II
496,guest150669,Pathetic. Rip off. Need I say more?,1,1 June 2000,"One of the worst movies I've seen in quite some time.  And considering I went in with low expectations, that speaks volumes.  It directly ripped off a scene from Last of the Mohicans, and ripped off its general feel from all the bond movies.  Not only is this movie not a sequel to Mission Impossible the TV series, it isn't even a sequel to Mission Impossible the movie. I'm not sure if I can say this movie sucked, but only because I think that comment might be censored.  This movie was predictable, lame and annoyingly plagiaristic.  I can't say enough poor things about this movie.  If I can help even one person from spending their hard earned money on this movie, then perhaps my misspent dollars are not gone completely in vain.Did I mention that John Woo (of whom I am generally a fan) did his worst work yet here?  His methods (e.g. slo-mo to build up drama and emphasize action) are tedious here.  The instant deep bond between the two main characters is ridiculous ('hey we almost killed each other!  Let's sleep together and form a lasting love bond') and all the other relationships are barely more believable.

The problem is that I was not prepared for such a bad movie. The first one had a great story and I really liked it, with a good dose of action. Now, what do we have in MI:2 ? A story that's been done thousands of times (scientists created a deadly virus and a bunch of bad guys steal it to become rich, doh), a flat love story for the girls, and last but not least 2 hours of completely unreal and stupid action scenes that make James Bond look like a kid. It's like a bad James Bond movie pushed to the extreme. When you see guys flying over bikes at 100 miles/hour that dont get injured when they hit each other you wonder if you are not seeing Robocop 10 or something... The biggest problem is the over used mask thing, there's a guy taking someone else's identity every 10 minutes and at a time he was wearing 2 masks on top of the other, and of course they are so perfect they can fool anyone right in front of them. We don't even learn anything on the characters, they are just like moving and talking muppets. Trust me, almost everything in this movie is bad, this is the perfect hyped piece of crap from Hollywood luring people in theatres.

Instead of building the movie around things that make the TV series so popular, such as careful mission planning, inventive gadgets, teamwork, and having a mission that is actually impossible, MI-2 relies heavily on slow-motion action, good looking sporty cars and motorcycles, exotic locations, which makes the movie look cheap artistically.Tom Cruise kept diving left and right in slow motion while shooting a few bullets at the villains the whole time.

MI-1 is so much better because the mission itself is impossible, but MI-2 looks like Rambo taking on a whole army by himself without being shot or even scratched.

501,catalystpaperbag,better than the first,9,1 June 2000,"I guess saying ""better than the first"" isn't really saying all that much considering how absolutely terrible the direction of Brian DePalma along with the lagging and occasionally incoherent script of the first film. But this one isn't bad at all. Not by a longshot. As a matter of fact, it embodies all that the past two james bond films have lacked: chemistry and involvement along with a slight unbelievability. The script is somewhat charming, although not anything totally out of the norm for your typical action film. I think we all know what really makes this film shine, although the script may be a secondary that by no means leaves it as a bad one. The true marvel? The stunts are all done and pulled off so well, you won't even find yourself thinking of how improbable it all is, if for not other reason than how wonderful it looks on screen after what appears as being so minute but must actually have been choreographed with a certain meticulous only a perfectionist like Woo embodies in the modern and fragmented Action blockbuster market. No one is really willing to take a chance anymore on action films unless they have a sure thing. I guess this was worth the large risk as Paramount has what is undoubtedly a sure-fire hit on their hands considering the lack of this type, or quality on the films released in the market at this time. I remember hearing that Cruise had bought the rights to the first and all M:I sequels shortly after the first films release. I thought he was just trying to get away with not repeating the same mistake three times, as he was reportedly signed at by contract. Instead, it appears he really does demand a lot of himself after all considering what a turn over it is from its predecessor...",Mission - Impossible II

Change the setting and the actors, and half the scenes in this movie could be substituted with ones from Face/Off (and vice versa) and you'd never be able to tell the difference.Fans of John Woo will find a lot to like here.

It has all the elements of a Woo film:  mirrored protagonist-antagonist, girl caught in the middle, even doves during action.  It also has an abundance of Woo-style action.  His famous slow-mos and superlative gunfire is all here.  It's a great ride for those who are looking strictly for action.  On the other hand, it has almost nothing to do with it's title.  The only Mission Impossible tradition which has been maintained is the disguises the hero (and villain) wears.  There is no ingenious sting, no avoidance and subterfuge - just in-your-face confrontation.I'm not saying it was a bad film.  For action fans, it's probably the best Woo film yet.

505,No 6,Simply the worst film ever made (Contains Spoilers!!!),1,25 July 2001,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first Mission Impossible. It was probably the only film that puts you into the mind of a secret agent as he tries to uncover a conspiracy that wiped out his cohorts. It had excellent twists, who would have thought that the hero of the TV series (Jim Phelps) finally turns into the bad guy.The sequel however has no plot, no interesting dialogue just mindless shootouts that would leave Gun and ballistic experts laughing in disbelief. John Woo is not a director he is a second unit director that got lucky. He cannot control his cast, he cannot convey any plot and he cannot stage believable action sequences.Woo seems to be directing (if you could call it that) in his sleep. The storyline seems to slightly mirror the original film in that a member of IMF goes rogue (not another one!!) and tries to release a Killer Virus called Chimaera on an unsuspecting world.Apparently IMF Boss (Anthony Hopkins) knows the whereabouts of the Villain's hideout and orders Ethan Hunt to plant the Bad Guy's Ex girlfriend in an attempt to undermine him. (Wouldn't it have been better if they just attacked the HQ with commandos etc)In the original film Ethan Hunt gets promoted to Jim Phelps rank within the organisation but in the sequel he is still a ""Point man"" jumping around in commando gear. Ving Rhames and his Australian colleague seem to do absolutely nothing in this film other than occassionally tap on a computer laptop keyboard and try to look serious. By removing the ""team"" element that made the series so great it makes the whole thing look like James Bond rather than Mission Impossible.An interesting point to note is that since we know that Jim Phelp's salary was 60K PA There is no way the Rogue IMF grunt in this film could afford a massive private army along with a beach front Condo.Some other laughable points in this film include:The painstaking attempt by Hunt to infiltrate a building by bungee jumping down a giant ventilator shaft while the Rogue IMF villain and his private army gingerly stroll through the front door of said building.The IMF villain must be unbelievably dumb to initiate a shootout (including explosions) with Ethan Hunt in a deadly Virus/Chemical research lab.The Second Unit Director's (Woo) laughable obsession with White Doves that seem to have more screen time than Anthony Hopkins.The throat elastoplast that enables people to talk like other people including perfecting their accents (South African, Scottish, American)And finally the car and motorcycle chases that seem to break the laws of physics rather than breaking the monotony of the plot.It is hard to believe that it took four years of rewrites and production/ shooting to create this sorry mess. Even the soundtrack by Metallica and Limp Bizkit is absolutely Tuneless and irrelevant to the film.Although it made an impressive opening weekend this film got so slated by critics and the media that it would be lucky to break even from box office takings. So do not expect an MI3 so quickly.This movie will have the distinction of earning a Golden Turkey award.",Mission - Impossible II
506,shalaka_shank,The spy survive only a girl not world,5,28 June 2009,"I watch this movie very interestingly. Movie is good. All Action scenes are superb. Story plot is well written. But I don't like the turning the story from a global matter to an individual. I mean that the spy was only running and chased by villain for survive a girl at the climax. It seems that the issue of world surviver from virus goes on and only remain on survive a girl. How foolish !. Therefore such a super spy movie made me disappointing last. I specially write this to read other readers. And let me know their opinion. Apart from this movie that ""Bourne"" series is best. I recommended ""Bourne"" movies to spy movie lovers. Rest movie is OK. The virus climax should have a long suspense.",Mission - Impossible II

508,haela,Tom Cruise and a few amazing sequences can't carry the failure of the rest,4,21 September 2012,"I'm a huge Tom Cruise fan, and I really wanted to like this film, but just couldn't.The romance was unbelievable, the plot poor, and the villain mis-cast. The dialog ranged from weak to cringe-inducing. During every action shot, a cheesy, hackneyed version of the main musical theme was played. Most of the fights were stylized and played in slow motion to the point of ridiculousness. One classic gadget was hideously overused. But my biggest gripe is that this is nothing like a Mission:Impossible movie. Gone is the stylish, slick, and very smart tone. Gone is our quick-on-his-feet hero with a magnetic smile. No more bluffs or playing sleight of hand with a 6 million dollar disc. Whoever John Woo thought his character is, he certainly isn't Ethan Hunt. And this movie sure isn't Mission:Impossible.Even if you can forgive the rape of Ethan and the franchise and hold this up to your average action flick, it still underwhelms.I don't blame the actors for this....they did what they could under terrible direction and with a terrible screenplay, Ving Rhames and Anthony Hopkins especially. And Tom always devotes himself to the film, managing here to be the only positive thing in the whole ordeal.Please forget this ever existed...go on to M:I:III and Ghost Protocol.",Mission - Impossible II
509,glasgow1873,"Not a bad film, a bit under rated.",6,13 January 2008,"I first watched this not long after it came out around about 2000. Back then my taste in films had yet to develop into what I now pride myself on. I enjoyed it back then. Great stunts, straightforward pop corn action story, good closure. I watched it again a few years back too and noticed a few more flaws that had gone past me before. From that point on I decided that this film was not a good film at all.My wife had asked me several times to buy the mission impossible trilogy as she had never saw them and was a Tom Cruise fan. I finally done this last week. We watched MI and throughly enjoyed it. I mentioned to her I was looking forward to MI3 but did not fancy sitting through MI2 again as I had saw it before and it appeared to be the weakest of the trilogy. Well...we watched it last night and I must say my opinion has changed again! This story is stupid. The script is wooden and Dougray Scott makes me cringe when I hear his Scottish accent on screen (not unusual for a Scotsman to cringe at his own accent!). BUT - the action is superb. John Woo makes for a completely different feel to the first film. This is a pop corn movie. Don't expect witty dialogue or the European feel to the first film. This is brain dead shoot em up material and its actually quite good.If your going to watch the trilogy then give this a try. Its not supposed to be real, after all its a suspension of reality (like most action films). Take it for that, ignore the poor script and you might just have a nice time watching it. Also, maybe its top flaw is the running time. 90 mins would have been spot on here. Instead we have close to 120 mins. I haven't saw MI3 yet - thats for tonight's viewing, but after watching this I am actually looking forward to it now.6/10",Mission - Impossible II
510,Hitchcock-3,Better than I thought,7,8 June 2000,"M:I-2 really isn't as bad as most critics are saying.  First of all, the action sequences are incredible, if overextended, and in a summer action blockbuster they're what matter most.  John Woo can direct anything as long as its got guns, cool cars, helicopter shots and stunts.  Tom Cruise is great as an action hero, and the movie successfully exploits his abilities. A few flaws: the dumb stunt with the masks got tiring before long; Dougray Scott is not a very intense villain; and the ending takes to long.  Besides that, Mission: Impossible is James Bond for the new millenium.  It might even be better than the first one (yes, did you realize that?  The first M:I movie is very good once you understand what's going on).Grade:B+",Mission - Impossible II

512,Paul M,Impossible story but beautiful action...,7,11 November 2000,"Unlike the first Brian De Palma Mission Impossible, this John Woo focused on the action. I have been a huge John Woo fan for some time and was pleased with the action scenes in this movie, some have complained about how over-the-top they are but does anyone actually go into a John Woo movie to see realistic action? The crew of MI2 developed the story only after several stunt sequences had already been plotted out and like most Hong Kong movies the story does tend to move along at a snail's pace until the last 30-25 minutes of the movie. All the Woo ingredients are here...the pigeons/doves, the hero brandishing two Berettas and elegant action sequence. For these reasons alone all Woo fans should see this movie.",Mission - Impossible II
513,Shingle,"Should've tasted better, but thankfully you can still digest it!",6,12 July 2000,"There have been so many TV Series' converted into movies. Though not many of the TV to cinema translations have been successful with the notable exception of Mission: Impossible.  An exception because this one now has a sequel.  The original movie made a massive profit even though it caused massive headaches with its confusing story. But this time around things have cooled down a little with a plot that can just about be followed if you give it your full attention. The mission here is to find and destroy samples of a new and deadly virus. Sounds simple enough, but this is of course Mission: Impossible, with the impossible element being that a group of terrorists being led by a former IMF agent (Scott) are also after the virus and need it for their own schemes. Things do get a little mixed up along the way but I don't think anyone is really going to care much to notice.  Things start off quite nicely with a hijack heist and then an impressive rock-climbing stunt! But moving on we then see that this is easily comparable to a Bond movie with a romantic relationship between all the action. Newton plays the love interest. She plays her role quite well at first as skillful thief, brought in to be part of Ethan Hunt's IMF team. But later she ends up having to be rescued in true James Bond fashion and doesn't do very much (or even talk) towards the end of the movie.  It's always good to see characters returning in sequels and Rhames making a comeback in this was a welcome sight. But, even though they aren't characters, there aren't a lot of those unique gadgets from the original, the kind you wish you had in the school playground, such as the glasses with a tiny camera and the explosive chewing gum. But to replace that there is an excessive amount of ""cool"" in this film such as fast cars and bikes, explosions, an array of sunglasses (which Cruise wears with great skill as they hardly ever fall off from his face). And then there's probably Cruise himself, looking impossibly like the whole ""cool"" package, getting whatever he wants (after all, he is also the producer as well as the main star). Unlike in the original he gets to use a gun this time around  actually make that two guns! With John Woo as director you've got all his trademarks thrown in such as his famous two-handed gunplay, innocent looking children, lots of slow motion shots and not forgetting the white doves! The action is there but things don't warmed up till half way through.  In the end we just have an action movie with a story that tastes like cereal with beer. It's pretty much style over substance but at least it's John Woo's style! It is quite a disappointment (you seem to expect much more from such a film) but it's still a watchable blockbuster, which is fun at times yet it's far from being great. Thankfully this is better then the first film though only just.My rating - 7 out of 10",Mission - Impossible II
514,sam2000,Good but not that good...,7,18 June 2000,"Pros: Great action, not overally complicated storyline, Thandie Newton and other overall cast, location of movie, the facelifting, cinematography and sound...Cons: Action scenes are at the too prolonged and very unrealistic, story is quite predictable at times, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise's character) is lost with identity crisis with James Bond and Jackie Chan.I personally liked the complex storyline presented in the prequel of Mission Impossible...it made me see the movie several times to understand it completely but I enjoyed...only someone like Brian De Palma could pull it off this ultimate story of deceive.Sure John Woo is the king of action but at the end 20 minutes of the film it becomes all pointless ... you know when there will be a macho fist to fist fight with the big bad guy, and hero wins, the villain fakes his death and rises up but the  hero is still a wiseass...and rescues the beautiful girl from the clutches of evil.Tom Cruise tries more to like the flamboyant James Bond rather the spying mole he played in MI-1. There were elements in the original series and first movie that I especially liked. These vital essence are missing in this movie.Otherwise the movie is quite ok, nice way to have fun and spend two hours time. John Woo fan will surely like it, but me being more interested the deciet, espionage and investigation prefer MI-1...compared to MI-2...At the end I give it 73 out of 100....the same score I gave ""The World is Not Enough""..",Mission - Impossible II
515,mhi,GoodMovie: Impossible II,5,14 September 2000,"The mission this time is not all that impossible. The fights, acting, masks, plot and other 'stunts' however are. It all wouldn't be so bad if this whole movie didn't take itself so seriously, but as it does it defeats itself and is reduced to a laughingstock. None of gadgets are really original, perhaps with the exception of the voice-altering foil (unless I missed that somewhere else). The trademark pigeons outnumber the actors and seem to get in the way. The CGIs have all been seen before and so has the stunt action. Okay, so I've never seen two cars lock up and spin like that - well, I'm not surprised. There aren't many films I'd expect to see a stunt with such low credibility in while taken so darn seriously.The very last fight scene almost had me in tears laughing, it was just so predictable and endless.

516,Drake-Z,Thankful I Only Rented It!,5,26 November 2000,"I never read these boards prior to seeing a movie. I like to walk in and out with just my own thoughts and expectations.This movie failed miserably for me. While I was impressed with Tom Cruise's athletic ability and the feats he achieved... The rest left me disappointed.The stunts were extensive, but the filming of them made them look like stunts. What I mean is.. Of course you know they could never happen, and I can accept that, but usually a film can make you believe it could have happened. Not this one. They were interesting, but just appeared to staged.The ""love"" story between Tom Cruise and Thandie Newton was ridiculous! Such strong love, trust and devotion from a 24 hour period?
Dougray Scott was the only redeeming factor in this film for me. He WAS believable and he pulled his role off perfectly.It was good entertainment for the time it was on, I didn't want to turn it off and forget it existed, but I am thankful it was just a 2.99 rental and not more.",Mission - Impossible II

The sequel is easier to follow the the original. Tom Cruise does well as an action hero.It doesn't deserve an oscar or anything like that. I thought that it was a bit like a James Bond film. I can't believe that Anthony Hopkins had such a small role. He has so much talent. I think that he should have been given a bigger role.In some parts of the film the action scenes are in slow motion like in Blade and The Matrix. The Matrix and Blade are better films. If you want a serious film then try one of the two I mentioned. If you want fun then watch this film.,Mission - Impossible II

Tom Cruise gives yet another self-aware, but interesting, performance.  Dougray Scott does his best with his cardboard villain, but comes off just as flat and colorless as his character.  Thandie Newton isn't given much to do with her character, except sleep with Cruise's character and some other stuff, too.  The highlight performance is the cameo by Anthony Hopkins, who, unfortunately, only turns up a few times in the film. Overall, certainly not a terrible film, but basically a waste of time.

OK, let`s go -BEFORE : I have been avaiting for this one to come as long as probably, everyone. So the moment I finally knew I`ll SEE IT NOW, was as anticipated as that One previous year (with the Star Wars Episode I). As everybody, I knew well and have myself expierenced numerous times, just how BAD sequels sometimes ARE. Anyway, I had several BUT, like John Woo`s superb action (who doubted it would be superb), Tom Cruise (has this guy made a BAD MOVIE through the last decade?) and a three years long being-in-production period. And, in spite of this, I doubted...AFTER : THIS WAS not THAT GOOD as Face/Off, but - THIS WAS    GREAT!  It`s exactly what I said to my friends after watchin` it, all I could say. To be honest, I tried to hate MI2, I tried hard, but I couldn`t ! I couldn`t hate the dialogues, in spite of the fact they were made just to give us a bit rest. I couldn`t hate several peaces, taken from the previous movie, mainly because I recognized them only watching the movie the third time. I couldn`t hate John Woo for making the SUMMER BLOCK and NOTHING MORE. But what do we call the SUMMER BLOCK ? Actors like Tom?  Do we? Action?  Oh my, after the MATRIX? Maybe, CGI then?  Please... We had a perfect Bond movie this Christmas and it seems like MI2 lacks all of its best : Cruise is playing alone, nobody to share the movie with him, finally, the plot was lost somewhere on the way to Paramount Studios. AND, ANYWAY, I COULDN`T HATE IT ! I think I couldn`t, because IT IS A JOHN WOO MOVIE after all, because Cruise makes his best in this role, IT has THAT THEME, and, finally, IT JUST TAKES YOUR BREATH AWAY !!!I must admit, I didn`t like the GLADIATOR at all, it FAILS to compare with all of the epic and historical movies I`ve seen. The choice is yours, but I think that the SUMMER has finally begun with the MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE II. & I recommend to see it all the fans of good entertainment, all the fans of John Woo - the Greatest action director of nowadays and all the fans of good films.",Mission - Impossible II

Tom Cruise and Thandie were great together!

The cast was fabulous and dougray made the PERFECT bad guy! Anthony hopkins of course was fabulous and since tom did all his stunts it was even better! Much better than the first one! on a scale of 1-10 I give it a 11! EVERYONE should see this movie!

I am just not one of those people that believe that you can create a good movie by choreagraphing a couple of elaborate fight scenes and then writing a some dialogue inbetween them.As amazing as it may seem, this movie is boring.  I can't get into the fight scenes because they are just too unbelievable.  They don't push the bounds of physics, they destroy the bounds of believability.
There is not a part of this movie that is redeeming in any way.  Things don't make sense, the characters are only developed so far as to become the most stereotypical hero/damsel/villian possible, and its an insult to the senses.I cannot stand John Woo or his approach to movie making.

Instead smarmy star superspy with high-tech gadgets and little support but opportunistic aide from sexy babe fights arch-rival to save the world. More like an unused James Bond script.It is all too cute and loses touch with whatever reality you can assign to such films. I don't believe the storage unit for the super-virus would be open to the air where a bird could poop on it. I don't believe a woman who has slept with both protagonists can't tell who is who even if they are wearing a mask. The mask bit was way too overdone.When the market is for fx and car crashes and explosions, this is what you get.

527,friedfysh,"Guilty Pleasure- Ethan Hunt ""American Bond""",8,7 September 2005,"When I first saw this film 5 years ago at the cinema I was a little disappointed. I enjoyed the film a lot but I was a big fan of Mission Impossible 1 and had seen the TV series on occasion. The first movie was a great spy film, with all its clever twists and turns and Ethan Hunt a sympathetic human character, here he is recast as action man or to put it another way the American version of James Bond, which would have been fine if not for Tom Cruise essentially being a completely different character than he was in MI1. But thats where the negative points end. This movie is, on the surface a big cheesy action film, the kind of thing Dolph Lundgren or Steven Segal would be in, only its good. There is a good plot despite many comments although you do get the sense that the plot was put in afterwards to facilitate the action. Essentially its about villains peddling a super virus and its cure so they can make money from making people ill and then selling the cure. Its really not that important, this movie shines in the action scenes and has some excellent cheesy dialogue ""This isn't mission difficult Mr.Hunt, this is mission impossible"" Overall this is the movie equivalent of eating an entire box of quality street to yourself in one sitting- you love it but feel a bit guilty afterwards.If you have the DVD be sure to watch ""Mission Improbable"" an excellent behind the scenes parody from MTV with Ben Stiller.",Mission - Impossible II
528,Hamza21,Idiotic.,7,5 September 2009,"It's hard to know which pejorative to open with to summarise this movie. Suffice to say that during the moments we were supposed to take seriously or be stunned by the choreographed action the people left and right of me were giggling, shaking their heads, or shielding their eyes with their hands. Sometimes all three things at once. And it's hard not to feel sorry for them: it's so embarrassing to have sit there and watch actors make fools of themselves. This movie is an excellent example of how it all goes wrong when you hire a director who doesn't premise his action scenes on real life, but on real life as portrayed in action movies. You basically get a double-dose of sickening unreality. Top five objectionable points: 1. During a hand-to-hand combat sequence, it apparently helps to leap into the air and rotate your body several times before planting a boot on your opponent's jaw. Ten times out of ten your opponent will not have ducked out of the way and despite having spun around several times for no reason, you will be able to land a perfectly accurate kick. Punching him may be quicker, but then the polaroids wouldn't look as exciting. 2. It's lazy. The movie makers have suited themselves at every turn and tossed any sense of reality out the window. Action movies were never meant to be true to life, but they knew where to stop before alienating their audience. This movie has no respect for its audience. 3. The film oozes the arrogant attitude of: 'Who cares about character development? The terrific action scenes will keep them happy'. Ahem. It's impossible to give a fig about the hero getting killed if you don't give a fig about the hero. So all suspense sequences instantly fail. 4. Leading on from that, the action sequences were *not* terrific. They were bombastic, self-satisfied and self-impressed. They looked ridiculous. You can tell the pivotal moment - you always see it replayed three times from different angles in slow motion. 5. The lovey-dovey scenes had about as much chemistry as an Arts exam. Thandie Newton has an annoying 'bloody' English accent and tries to look like one of the Corrs. Tom Cruise's slo-mo action moments could have been for a shampoo advert. Plus a plot that makes no sense, a villain who could equally have played a tax inspector, and not one - imagine - not one attempt at a one-liner.

In between lie the most boring two hours imaginable.  What little action there is looks so improbable as to cause the theater audience to laugh. Face masks coming and going. Apparently, Tom cruise carries around with him masks of all his enemies so that he can impersonate them on the fly. Then there is the acting -- better phrased, what acting?

If, on the other hand, none of this appeals to you then you should not expect to enjoy MI:2, but at least give it credit for succeeding in its intentions.John Woo's visuals blend harmoniously with Hans Zimmer's etherial score throughout the entire movie and it becomes apparent that this is a real work of art, it just happens to be packaged in the 'Mission Impossible' framework.

Now the biggest complaint of this movie by people is the plot. Well, let me settle things right now. The villain, Ambrose, almost has his hands on a super virus, and its cure, meaning he could make millions off marketing both. It's up to IMF to stop him.

Jim Phelps had to pull off some very subtle acts at times.  That very light-handed approach was why the missions were considered ""impossible"".
So what does Ethan Hunt do? Wreak havoc wherever he goes, it seems. No subtlety here, rather just an excuse to pack as much meaningless action into two hours as you can.

Instead of coming up with a super suspense action movie with a ""clever"" plot line we are reduced to seeing the rock and roll tidbit of her walking along the dock to her ex-boyfriend in slow motion and then if that wasn't painful enough we must then watch a sequence where he grabs the scarf as it goes flying in the wind as if it was such a powerful scene.  Agony!!!!! It's a bad sign when you're hoping that the girl WILL kill herself in the end just because she's been so annoying throughout the whole film as a woman who started out with promise and ended up being the wimp needing the man to save her.  Rubbish.  I hope no one decides to come out with a third one.  I don't think I could take another movie with MORE slow motion sequences.",Mission - Impossible II
538,kilgres_bloodmoon,Tom Cruise's Ego Trip,5,27 May 2000,"There's no real way to describe how I felt about ""Mission: Impossible 2"". Perhaps the only way to put it is that if the first film's glaring problem was that there was too much plot, the second film's glaring error is that there is too little plot. Bottom line, ""M:I-2"" simply can't be held afloat by its special effects alone.However, the action sequences are what makes this movie a benchmark for future directing. Employing bullet time photography (last seen in ""The Matrix""), the special effects team has created the most amazing action sequences this side of ""Gladiator"". As a requisite of the filmmaking techniques of John Woo (""Broken Arrow"", ""Face/Off""), ""M:I-2"" is chock full of heart stopping action, accompanied by the presence of white doves fleeing battle, and enough over-dramatism to make Baz Luhrmann blush.The main problem lies in the same fact that made ""Battlefield: Earth"" a terrible miscalculation: The ability of big name stars to produce their very own pet projects. Tom Cruise obviously had a little more than a lot to do with the way in which the film was put together. The entire plot revolves around his character, the neo-Bond IMF agent, Ethan Hunt. Cruise claims that the only thing that remains the same about his character is the name. He's right in that respect. Gone is the clean cut, debonair but calculating, and most importantly, vulnerable, Ethan Hunt. Arriving out of left field is the brand new, so fearless he's almost stupid, ""I would do anything for love"" Ethan Hunt.Just on an up note, the stunts in this film are simply amazing. I would like to extend my personal kudos to Tom Cruise for volunteering to do the rock climbing scene himself. John Woo wanted to make himself perfectly clear when stating that all the stunts were done old-fashioned, and were only ""slightly"" enhanced by CGI manipulation.I am personally unsure of what point was being made by the production of this film. What it boils down to is the shameless use of two hours and ten minutes as a vehicle for new special effects techniques. Making her appearance as Nyah, an internationally renowned thief and love interest of Mr. Hunt, is Thandie Newton. While Miss Newton CAN act, she can only do so in the respect that she's the perfect Woo heroine: spunky and sexy. The regrettable fact is that it feels throughout the film that they built a complex, promising plot and realized they had to shave away at it to jam in a hammed up love story.The presence of Anthony Hopkins is a plus, but it's obvious that he is only present to add another high profile name to the marquee. The sad truth is that Sir Anthony is only given a sparse four or five minutes of screen time.The final product: This film should have been looked over seriously before release. It's not half as complex as the last film, which will, regrettably, be a plus in the minds of most moviegoers. The overacting is anything but endearing, and the villain is nowhere near believable, but that's Hollywood. The special effects are amazing, but a tad over-the-top (see car chase/carousel ride). And we come to an end result that we should leave the acting to the actors and the directing to the directors. Sorry, Tom. Swinging for the fences doesn't always bring a home run.",Mission - Impossible II
539,Fruzzl,John Woo what did you do?,6,12 June 2000,"As a great fan of John Woo movies I was disappointed with his latest American film. The action was great, but what was the go with every action sequence having 80% of it in slow-mo? Secondly the love story thing has been done before and was too much a part of this weakly written story. This movie had less than quarter of the suspense of the first. One more thing to add, I feel Im speaking for all Australian's when I say that the Aussie actor (helicopter pilot) was too say the least, appalling, why do the American viewers have to see an Aussie with the worst Aussie accent we over here have ever heard? And the other accents were shocking, what were they supposed to be?Anyway, if they are going to make another some time they should really look back at the first one and think why that one was so much better than this second attempt.Stu",Mission - Impossible II

After having seen ""Mission Impossible 2"" I feel that I should have criticized TWINE a lot more than I did. In my opinion, M:I2 is -exactly- what a modern Bond film should be like.There will be plenty of lengthy reviews written by people more talented than me at dissecting this film, so I won't go into any details here.

541,James McK,"Apparently, making a ""new"" action film is mission: impossible",5,5 July 2000,"OK, we'll get this out of the way, first thing, I liked the first Mission: Impossible. A lot of people do not. I did. A lot. Mainly because it was tricky, it was unpredictable, it made something new by playing on audiences expectations of the old, but its these expectations of old that M:I2 sticks directly to. Right to a fault.You may say, hey, its a proven formula, why not stick with it. So, yes, M:I2 does have some good action, some great action. If that is what you came to see, that is what you are going to get. Some good action.The thing is, I expected so much more from John Woo. I knew he was going to destroy everything the original stood for and turn it into an action movie with kung fu, explosions, and who can forget, pigeons, and I was absolutely blown away by Face/Off, and excitied by the M:I2 trailer, so what then was the problem. Well... I suppose my expectations may have been too high, exciting yes, but new, different or special, no. Just above average really.Then the plot... uh, well, usually in action movies they spend as little time on the plot as possible. This, however is a Mission: Impossible film so you must, must include all sorts of espionage and hi-tech bits and pieces and face swapping (what do these people conveniently walk around with a bag with other peoples faces in it). So a lot of time is spent on plot, while it is paper thin they've tried to complex it up, but they still cannot save it. Just another terrorist thriller plot. Should have just left it as an excuse for more action. And the romance, the supposed backbone of the story, well, although Thandie Newton is one sexy lass, it is a thoroughly rushed, unbelievable, and subsequently indifferent romance. Who cares? I didn't. And John Woo, master of the over the top, who pulls of brilliant action scenes, explosions and slow motion hero shots in Face/Off, which was just over-the-top to begin with so it was a lot of fun, here though every thing is taken to seriously and Woo's direction just seems off the mark, tacky, and in the case of Tom Cruise's hero shots, dare I say, homoerotic. All this and the returning characters from M:I were bastardized along with the rest of it.

I had seen the first Mission Impossible and it was one of my favorite movies of the year. I liked how the movie was confusing at first but made sense towards the end. The scenes from the movie reminded me of a show called ""Alias"" which has just come out on ABC.But Mission Impossible 2 was an amazingly horrible movie.  I don't think they could have made a worse movie.  Besides the whole movie being about cheesy action scenes and stupid secret agent scenes, the movies plot was pointless.  The car chase completely copied a old James Bond Movie and Tom Cruise had a midiocre performance.  I was let down.I was shocked to find out that Roger Ebert gave this movie thumbs up!  How could he possibly recomend this movie.  Richard Roeper had given it thumbs down at the time and then later put it into his worst movies of the year list.This movie should be burned.  It is a horrible discrace to all movies. IMDB.com should have let you be able to give movies a '0' because this movie deserves it.  Unfortunetly I could only give it a one.",Mission - Impossible II

Recently I started from the beginning. The first one was a good film overall. The second however is a different story. Some of the trademark elements are on the top here, like the frequent use of lifelike masks and the top-notch action scenes. Still, I had a hard time watching this title throughout. Somehow the directing made it a chore to enjoy. Melancholia was a daydream compared to this. Otherwise, the story was pretty dull, the whole character and romantic progression was awkward. I did not feel the connections believable and rushed. Of course, this is an action movie, but still it needs to be coherent.

Notice, I'm not comparing this to ""great"" films, but to its fellow silly pointless fun action movies. This one is truly terrible. Like many action movies MI: II decided to rely on fancy new special effects instead of a plot that makes the slightest bit of sense. Now, an action movie's plot doesn't have to make any sense, but it'd better be damn enjoyable.Seeing people pull off their uber-realistic ""mask"" once, was awesome. By the 40th time (Ok, I don't remember how many times but it was far too many and was just a pathetic gimmick because the writers sucked)it is no longer cool, just stupid. Especially stupid since a mask doesn't magically make 5' something Tom Cruise over 6' tall. Apparently you never noticed your boss was so much shorter than you...Now, a bad plot, overdone special effects, that's not the worst thing ever. No, Mr. Woo saves that for the end.*****************SPOILER ALERT********************There will be spoilers here. And possibly some sarcastic comments. You can avoid both if you like and stop now.Mr. John Woo, the ""abuse of slow motion makes every movie better"" master really takes things over the top in the final hours, er, minutes of the film.

548,PugsMom,Exciting But Stupid,5,30 May 2000,"In terms of action, this movie will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat, but it had a high ""cringe"" factor. When I think of ""Mission Impossible"" I don't think ""love story"" and that's exactly what this movie is. I just couldn't bring myself to believe that Ethan Hunt would actually get hooked on a woman after spending one night with her. Ethan is too smart to fall for that and I was extremely disappointed by his bad judgment.The action scenes are well shot, the pace of the film is excellent, and the storyline is interesting. I love Tom Cruise as an actor (and as a male physical specimen) and he did a great job of playing Mr. Joe-Cool-Secret-Agent-Guy. But that's the problem...he's too cool to fall for a professional thief like Naya. I just didn't buy it. Speaking of Naya...she impressed me in the beginning of the film, but after the first half-hour her two or three limited facial expressions got a bit old. Keep in mind that most of the action sequences are so unbelievable you might just laugh out loud. But I guess that's the point???? Also, I got a bit sick of all the mask-rip-offs -- I could see them coming a mile away. Anthony Hopkins should have had a slightly bigger role because he's a brilliant actor and didn't have much of a part to work with.MI2 is worth seeing, but I my opinion the first one was MUCH better.",Mission - Impossible II

As a longtime fan of the original series, it was extremely disappointing in that it had no ""style"" - simply a hacked-together mess of action sequences.With the new movie, you have to understand and acknowledge that Woo has a trademark action style that you either love, or hate.  I think it worked very well in MI2.I'll say right out that I'm not a Tom Cruise fan, however he WAS good in this movie - this is the movie that the last Bond movie should've been.Who could end a MI-2 review without a note about the remarkable Thandie Newton, who I havn't seen before this feature.

550,fishpoo,A comparison of M:I-1 & M:I-2,6,11 May 2003,"Mission: Impossible 1 is a movie about an agent getting framed and then solving a mystery. It's more of a Thriller than an Action movie. Mission: Impossible II is a completely different kind of movie. It's just like every other average action movie: Lots of action, not much plot, a boring bad guy and a good looking woman.Mission: Impossible 1 is definitely a much better movie than M:I-2. But it does still have quite a few flaws. I often have trouble following plots. But after watching Mission Impossible twice I still don't understand all of what's going on and I don't think I'm the only person who has this problem. This doesn't stop the film from being entertaining, but it's a bit annoying. I think I understood everything in M:I-2, not that there is much to understand.What annoys me the most about Mission: Impossible 1 is the fact that Jim (Jon Voight), one of the most important characters, isn't around for most of the movie. So his character didn't really get very developed. As for Claire, I don't think the movie would be any different if she weren't in it.The characters in Mission Impossible II are more traditional. The villain is someone who used to work with Ethan but has now turned bad. He has a Scottish accent, to let us know that he's the bad guy. If Ethan's boss hadn't said anything, I would have never guessed that the villain and Ethan worked with each other. They seem like complete strangers.My favorite part of Mission Impossible 1 has got to be the bit where Ethan and his gang steal information from the computer in that room with all the high security. I've seen it spoofed in quite a few other things. M:I-2 doesn't really have anything like that. Except Ethan Hunt retrieving the disease. But that wasn't really the same thing and it just turned into a big action scene with lots of guns. Stuff like that isn't very entertaining these days. Most of the action scenes in M:I-2 also involve loads of slow motion. This is just annoying and not cool.Overall I give Mission: Impossible 3/5 and Mission: Impossible II 2/5. I hope Mission: Impossible 3 will be more like the first film.",Mission - Impossible II

How about a movie without you dangling from a rope? Or playing Kick-Boxer Guy? How about taking some of those dollars and investing in an original idea? You used to be something.

Would have made an ok James Bond movie, but didn't fit with the MI genre. Too much shooting, exploding and none of the teamwork and twists that marked the series.  And enough of the rubber mask effects, it got old in the first movie. And speaking of the first movie, I would rather have a convoluted, hole-filled plot than this plot built around action sequences.

554,evildead-13,Weak (spoilers),4,4 June 2000,"This movie had a few good action scenes, amazingly predictable plot twists, a few gaping plot holes and a sense of unoriginality. I had to wonder how Nyah Hall(Thandie Newton) could get from downtown Sydney to those cliffs so quickly. And this brings up something else, really Cruise is only fighting to save one person, so if she does get infected it'll just be her who dies. Though we're supposed to care for this character, it's just not that evil of a plan when only one person dies. Also according the laws of action movies the girl can't die, so you know she's not going to bite the chimera. I also have to wonder how Cruise can punch somebody once in the head and they're knocked out but he can punch and kick Dougray Scott and even smash his head into a pointy rock, and what's this? Scott is conscious. I don't mind Woo's constant firing and no reloading, but this just got plain ridiculous. Also with the face masks, how obvious was that? It also seems strange that Dougray Scott who is a couple of inches taller than Cruise can play Cruise so well. I thought the movie had a few good action scenes like in the lab and at the storage facility but overall just wasn't very exciting or fun. John Woo should stick to Hong Kong action, like the Killer and Hard Boiled. overall 3/10",Mission - Impossible II
555,sivartis,Trying to be something more.,5,29 May 2000,"Contains spoilers.Like so many movies of the past few years, Mission 2 seemed like a movie in search of itself.  It felt like it was trying to be many things that is just quite couldn't.  And more important to the detriment of the film, I kept saying things to myself during the film.  Things like, ""The fight scenes were good, but they were better in The Matrix,""  ""The choreography of the action scenes was OK, but they were more intense in Face/Off,""  or ""The gadgets were neat, but they were cooler in James Bond.""  One more thing I couldn't get out of my head - and don't take this the wrong way - was ""How did they get Tom Cruise's hair to be all silky and wavy when he flips around like that?""  Actually, I think Cruise got paid $25 million, and his hair must've got another $5 million at least, for all the acting it did.  The movie was enjoyable, don't get me wrong, but it lacked the *escapist* element.  The female lead, Thandie Newton, was terrific in her role as the thief turned spy.  And she almost had more emotion as Tom's Hair.  Um, that's supposed to be a compliment.  But it brings up another problem.  All the other actors seemed a bit under used.  Ving Rhames, at the time of the first movie, was on the verge of becoming a major African American film star.  What with his great performances in Pulp Fiction, Dave, and Out of Sight, you'd think he'd have a bigger role this time around.  But if anything, it was less memorable than the Hair.  (I'm sorry, that's really the biggest thing I remember about the movie now, 5 hours after seeing it.) And where did the other member of the IMF team come from, and what was his purpose?  My point being simply that the characters were very under used. Oh!  There's another thing.  The bad guy.  No, I didn't have a particular problem with Dougray Scott, he was supposed to look like Cruise.  But his henchman rubbed me the wrong way.  Mr. Stamp (a bit too close to Tomorrow Never Dies' Mr. Stamper) couldn't decide whether he was an intelligent killer, or a bad-a** thug.  I would have preferred the former, and liked to have seen Thomas Jane from Deep Blue Sea in that role.  He makes a really good brooding bad guy.  Another major part of the ""under used"" list was Anthony Hopkins.  He made a passable IMF leader, but he didn't look like he was enjoying himself very much.Ok, it was worth seeing, definitely.  I just think it should have concentrated more on the action than the romance, or the other way around.One last note. As a would-be filmmaker, I had to notice the over-use of the suddenly very popular slo-mo shot.  It was just short of annoying.  Let's hope for a return to more traditional film styles, instead of the ""so-different-it's-cool"" motif we're seeing so much of lately.  It's not that I don't like new and exciting, but not when it's used just because it's new and different.",Mission - Impossible II
556,UnclePaul,"The film that the original ""Mission Impossible"" should have been",8,26 May 2000,"Director John Woo is the epitome of an action film director.  His action scenes are choreographed like dances--Bullet Ballet, if you will.  He's also known for effective use of slow-motion photography, and all of his films have a very stylish look.  His best films were made in Hong Kong--rent ""Hard Boiled"", ""The Killer"", or ""A Better Tomorrow 1 & 2"" to see what I mean. None of his Hollywood films have lived up to that standard, but ""MI:2"" stands alongside ""Face/Off"" as his best American work to date.The original ""Mission Impossible"" made a ton of money, but the plot also made a ton of people say ""huh?"".  The nearly incomprehensible story took the steam out of the action, the cool score, and the even cooler gadgets. (Although I did find the 'chopper in the tunnel' finale a little too ludicrous.)  Thankfully, ""MI:2"" has simplified the story, and improved upon the score and the gadgets.  And the action sequences are visually more impressive and much more exciting.  In ""MI:2"", a fast-acting, lethal virus has fallen into the hands of villain Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), and Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) needs the help of a beautiful thief (Thandie Newton) and his computer genius buddy (Ving Rhames) to get it back.  That's it--that's the plot.  Not 25 lines.  Just one sentence!!  Perfect for an action film. In fact, rumor has it that the story was finished only after they decided on the action sequences.  I'd believe it--this isn't exactly an epic story a la ""Doctor Zhivago"" or ""Ben Hur"".Let's start with the action sequences.  They're amazing.  Woo is certainly the master of creating action scenes with the added benefit of great style. His use of slow-motion enhances the frenetic fights and chases, and there are many fights and chases.  To me, the original ""MI"" lacked the full-out action that I expected from the Impossible Mission Force.  ""MI:2"" did not leave me wanting.  It's certainly the most exciting film I've seen this year.  Many bullets fly, cars and motorcycles chase each other, there is hand-to-hand combat, and several different objects find ways to explode. The motorcycle chase finale is on par with the boat chase in ""Face/Off"", and the final fight seems to take up the last 25 minutes of the film as it transitions from one locale to another.  An extra bonus: you'll recognize Cruise in most of the scenes--he did a large amount of his own stuntwork. An early climbing sequence (you've seen some of it in the theatrical trailer) is especially impressive in this regard.Cruise is an underrated actor, but maybe that's changing since his well-deserved Oscar nomination for ""Magnolia"".  I count this as Cruise's first all-out action film, so it didn't require too many of those skills. But I'm sure it was quite a workout.  Several of his films have had action sequences, but he's not flying a jet (""Top Gun"") or driving a race car (""Days of Thunder"") in ""MI:2"".  And he's really quite good.  His role in ""MI"" was more dramatic than aerobic, playing the cold and impersonal Agent Hunt.  Cruise actually gets to show emotions this time, making Hunt a much more enjoyable character.  He also does the main thing I wanted to see him do in ""MI""--kick a lot of butt.  He's like an American James Bond: charming, intelligent, and ruthlessly lethal when necessary.  Newton's character is similar to the best of the Bond girls: she's sexy, has attitude, and brings something to the table other than just screaming ""help me"".  Newton debuted to great reviews in 1991's ""Flirting"", but this should be the film that gets her widely known (except for the 25 people who saw ""Beloved"" in 1998). Unfortunately, I really didn't sense a lot of chemistry between her and Cruise, and her role pretty much disappeared in the final quarter of the film.  Rhames is excellent as always.  He's been good every time I've seen him--a filmography that includes ""Bringing out the Dead"", ""Entrapment"", ""Out of Sight"", ""Con Air"", ""Rosewood"", and ""Pulp Fiction"".  This movie also has some humor, with most of the good lines going to Rhames and a helicopter pilot who might remind you of Murdock on ""The A-Team"".  One thing I'll say for Woo's American films--he's always had a showy role for the villain. (Lance Henrikson in ""Hard Target"", John Travolta in ""Broken Arrow"", and Nicolas Cage/Travolta in ""Face/Off"").  And ""MI:2"" is no exception--Scott (probably best known as Drew Barrymore's Prince in ""Ever After"") really chews the scenery as the villanous Ambrose.I've made a few James Bond references because this film has all the elements of a good Bond film.  Dastardly villain threatens the world, and it's up to the daring secret agent to save the day and the girl who's in the clutches of said villain.  He must defeat the 'bad guys' through fights and chases in exotic locales, helped by numerous gadgets and a few trusty allies.  In fact, ""MI:2"" reminds me of ""Thunderball"" (1965), one of my favorite Bond films.With all that praise, why does it get 3.25 stars instead of 3.5 or 4?  For a few (fairly minor) reasons.  I've already mentioned the lack of chemistry between Cruise and Newton--they're certainly easy on the eyes, but the relationship wasn't really believable.  They 'met cute', and their interactions never grew more interesting after the first 15 minutes.  Also, the first 45 minutes were plagued with way too many slow-motion shots of people walking.  That's it--just walking.  I can understand it for action sequences, but just watching Cruise or Newton walk through a room or down the street?  It actually got a bit annoying.  Anthony Hopkins appears very briefly as Hunt's boss, but their interaction didn't interest me as much as the usual ""M sending 007 off on the mission"" scene at the beginning of the Bond films.  The first 45 minutes are worth 2.5 stars, but it ends big--raising the overall film to 3.25 stars.Buy your popcorn and prepare for a real thrill ride, and I don't think you'll be disappointed by ""MI:2"".

Mission Impossible 2 not only defeats the first Cruise MI,  it defeats any other action movie out as it is released in theaters.  Woo's style is obvious throughout the film,  from the birds to the sunglasses,  to all of the action done in his style.  The beginning contains little action,  as Woo tells a story much less complicated than the first but enough to get you interested.  The 2nd half of the film contains more action than all of the 1st MI movie combined.  There are tense situations,  hand to hand fights,  and the usual Woo standoffs.

Whatever you do, don't watch this film in the hope of another story of betrayal and mystery. Instead this is a film of action and is more likely to interest fans of James Bond than MI.The problem with Mission Impossible 2 is that it starts well but soon slows down to a crawl as the story is built up, this does serve as an introduction to the story but after a couple of viewings this part of the film becomes tedious. In fact when i am watching this film i often find myself skipping these bits in order to get to the end.It is the second half of the film where the film works it's magic, starting with a tribute to MI1's most famous scene. The film from here on in is full of emotion and action (As well as a clever twist). these scenes are also lent a hand by an amazing soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer.However another thing that you must be ready for if your going to watch this film is that this film is by no means original (evil man gets virus)in fact it is often comparable to James Bond (especially the car duel at the start which stinks of Bond's duel with Xenia Onatopp in Goldeneye) This film is by no means groundbreaking and doesn't deserve to win any awards but it does provide a reasonable story (although slightly overdone) combined with some brain and a lot of brawn.7/10",Mission - Impossible II

But this sequel's plot is so simple that you could get absolutely bored out of your mind, and I see why a lot of people don't care for M:I-2 at all.Thankfully John Woo knows how to direct action scenes (and doves) and the last 30 mins really hits hard. From explosions (about every 30 secs) to Tom Cruise rolling around while shooting, to Tom Cruise jumping around while shooting, to white doves flying around while things are shot at (and while things explode) you have a great popcorn flick here. Big thumbs up to the great stunt work, but maybe work on the story this time around? I mean anytime you have a character mention how simple the task at hand is going to be you gotta know your in trouble. Tom Cruise is always awesome (yes I love him-- as an actor) and Thandie Newton was very impressive as Cruise's love interest but Dougrey Scott was just OK. At some moments he was good but at the end I just couldn't wait for him to die... and not because he was so good at being evil... he just got downright annoying.But still I found myself enjoying this ride of explosions, Cruise's long hair, and doves.

This one...well it was over-the-top.There are no memorable action scenes, no memorable characters, Ving Rhames was annoying as hell in this, and the romance was really forced. Ethan (Cruise) tries to hook up with this girl (Newton) after he busted her on her mission and nearly got into a fatal car crash with her.

570,ctseeker,There is no Team in this Mission,2,9 October 2005,"Well if your into Tom Cruise and nothing else then this is a flick for you.But if your looking for the TEAMwork of the original series, it is totally gone. The first incarnate of the movie versions had some team, but they killed them all off right at the beginning.I now see why none of the original TV cast would not even touch these Cruise vehicles.Basically these efforts are for Cruise, by Cruise and of Cruise.The overall plot line of any IMF mission is to overcome some evil with cunning, planning, individual skills and TEAMWORK, all brought together to mess in to a win over evil.With these movie versions we have one Hero, Cruise, who has ALL the skills, talents, and knowledge to overcome the evil doers. In this case a combination of terrorist and businessman to black mail the world thru the use of a germ agent. The funny part is Cruise's portrayal of his battle with these evil villains and plot is nothing more than a personal ego boost for himself. Even a James Bond or Superman where never as full of themselves, they where confident but did battle for god and country not for themselves.There is of course the race against time to save not a TEAM member, and t the world, but Cruise's love interest. Preventing the world from getting the virus always seems less important. It always seems to be what is in Cruise's best interest.If you are a fan of the old TV series, where disappointed with the first MI movie, i.e. making PHELPS and a team member the villains, this vehicle will make just make you even more disappointed. I can only imagine what a MI3 would be like.I swear these efforts are trying to erase the original IMF TEAM from our fond memories.",Mission - Impossible II

To say I disliked this film really does not go far enough, I truly hated it. Normally I can find a positive out of a film and I like films of all genres, especially good action films.This film was surrounded with a lot of marketing hype at the time it was released in the UK about how it was a fantastic John Woo action movie packed with excitement. The ""action"" scenes were what disappointed me the most, they would have been laughable apart from the fact that this film took itself so seriously.Most of all this film was boring, boring, boring! Not what you want or expect from any action film. I can accept no plot and bad acting as long as there is some half-decent action in a film. This film was just dull and irritating with terrible action scenes (the motorbike chase scene is just stupid).I think this film must be Cruise's worst hour, even if he tried to act worse I don't think it would be possible. The more I think about this film the more I realise it was probably the worst film I have ever seen.I'm not being spiteful, I enjoyed Woo's Face Off and I thought Cruise was good in The Last Samurai.

There were so few elements of the series - the elements that made it unique - and the ones present were so poorly used, that there seemed little point in badging a fairly exciting spy action film with the M:I2 name.

(WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD)Of course, things that happen in an action movie don't always refer to reality, but there's a certain point where it just becomes ridiculous. Take for example the _three_ times when a character is not the person he seems to be, but (gasp!) someone else wearing a face mask (two of these are applied within seconds by Cruise's character, who seems to have an instant face mask generator in his pocket). Or consider the motorbike chase:  things like these _don't happen_. When Roger Ebert reviewed some action movie the other day, he observed that the action scenes could as well be performed by Bugs Bunny, because you're always aware that no human being will ever perform these moves without massive support from the vfx department. That's what I thought here, too.Apart from that, you'll find about every movie cliche you can think of... (I'm still waiting for a movie where the good guy kills the bad guy and _makes sure_ he's dead. These secret service guys can disarm a nuclear weapon with a paper clip and some gaffa tape, but they can't kill someone for good - hmm, they can kill dozens of nameless thugs with single kicks, but not _the bad guy_.)About the only strong point I found was that the movie looks great (i.e., it looks _expensive_). - Save your money and go rent some of those Bruckheimer flicks (The Rock, Con Air).

578,pmwgreen,"Loved this film, Woo tries to be Hitchcock, Succeeds?",8,1 June 2000,"I loved this film and will go and see it again.Firstly, you have to understand this film is at the very least a homage to Notorious, if not a remake. I don't know how the studio let them do it. That film, made just after WWII, is the kind of film that just doesn't get made anymore, it's not bloody enough for your average teenager. I love Hitchcock, my favorite is To Catch A Thief, and I see a lot of Hitchcock in this film. I'm sorry that so many people don't think there was enough killing in the first half of the film, but there isn't supposed to be and frankly I enjoyed it. I think Woo gets a pretty good level of thrill out of people NOT falling off cliffs, NOT getting caught in a secret meeting and shooting their way out, etc. I'm sorry there wasn't more of the sort of action seen at the race track, the slight of hand and people dodging around behind each other. People talking to each other on secret mikes while watching each other through binoculars just gives me a big grin, I don't know why. That said, I think that the original ending of Notorious is pretty lame, you almost feel sorry for Claude Rains. Woo gives us, well, a different one.Secondly, and this is just my theory, the first time you see John Woo's work it hits you between the eyes. You're not quite sure what you saw, or why you thought it was so amazing, but you know you have to see more. And then it never seems quite as striking after that. It's good stuff, but you start looking at everything except the action. Lots of people seem to be complaining that they saw Face/Off and this isn't as good. Frankly, I thought Face/Off was an atrocity exhibition and not nearly as good as Broken Arrow. MI-2 has just the right mix.",Mission - Impossible II

Whereas the original was like the TV series, this is an action film in the style of -- yeah, guess who.After my initial distress at not getting something like the previous movie passed, I learned to like this. A lot. Just don't go to the theater expecting M:I. Expect John woo making an action film.A nice touch was what my brother and I called ""The Love Story"" of the film, involving of course Tom Cruise and Thadie Newton.And the addition of the doves (if you haven't seen movie yet, you'll see what I mean) seriously reminded me of Face/Off, another great movie directed by -- yeah, guess who.Yeah.

MI:2 wasn't like the original movie, but that in no way is a bad thing.  Mission Impossible was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The dialogue was laughably bad- ""Asta Lasagna, don't get any on ya."" And, if you didn't understand the plot the first time you saw it, then you have no right to critique any film.  I find it hard to believe that anyone under the age of 10 didn't understand what was going on.  Those are probably the same people that are saying how bad the sequel was. Mission Impossible: 2 was designed to be an implausible movie.  Of course there were unbelievable stunts, like when Ethan did a back-flip while running forward.  But that was the point!  It was supposed to be a bunch of crazy stunts.  No one ever questions the fact that James Bond dives off a cliff after a falling plane, or when Arnold lifts up an incredibly huge gun after getting shot in the shoulder!  It's supposed to be mindless action. Do you really think that John Woo thought the motorcycle chase was 100% realistic? Everyone is complaining about the fact that Cruise and Newton fell in love after one night.  Is this the FIRST time we've seen this in a movie?!  Of course not!  Did anyone question that whole fact in Titanic?  That whole movie was based on the fact that two people can fall in love immediately, and it is the most popular movie of all time.  Why doesn't everybody lash out at James Cameron because HIS movie was unrealistic? Anthony Hopkins' role in the film was most probably a volunteer job.  Lots of actors like to volunteer for a movie that they would really like to be in, without being credited.  Emilio Estevez wasn't credited for his role in the first Mission Impossible.  It happens a lot more than people realize. Plus, Hopkins gets to give one of the coolest lines in the film, ""This isn't Mission: Difficult, Mr. Hunt, it's Mission: Impossible.  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you."" A lot of people were saying that Ving Rhames didn't have a big enough role. Did you even see the movie?  I've seen it twice now, and he's in it the whole time! I don't understand why people can't just sit back and enjoy movies these days.  John Woo has come out with another winner, and I will continue to enjoy his films.

586,kylezombie,This movie is incredible,10,24 May 2000,"I do not understand all the negative feedback about this film.  It is one of the best action/suspense movies I've seen in a long time. First of all, the original movie was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting was so incredibly bad, and the so-called ""confusing"" plot seemed very mainstream to me. When I first heard of the sequel, I groaned, but then I learned that John Woo would be at the helm.  My animosity soon turned to anticipation. While Woo's early American films (Hard Target, Broken Arrow) couldn't even compare to his Chinese movies (A Better Tomorrow, Hard Boiled), his latest movie, Face/Off was a real winner. While keeping the suspenseful MI style scenarios intact, Woo also adds his ultra-cool action sequences.  Seeming to not be restricted by the PG-13 rating, he makes his fight scenes almost like a ballet, and his trademark ""violence as poetry"" is better than ever. The unbelievable motorcycle chase was exciting and fun, in that James Bond-esque implausible way. The love scenes that spark between Cruise and Newton after their car chase were very good, and nothing prompts good passion like a near-death experience. Now, while some scenes were fairly predictable (like all the masks), Woo keeps everything pretty fresh; with the exception of some of his trademarks, like the doves, the slow-motion, and the gun-play that he used to use with such candor with the god-like Chow Yun-Fat. I don't understand all the negativity that this movie has sparked, especially since this was made for pure entertainment.  It's rare that you see a movie like this that is smart as well as action-packed, and John Woo once again delivers.  I hope that his next movie, ""King's Ransom,"" will be just as intense and exciting. I definitely recommend that everyone check this film out.",Mission - Impossible II

I cringe every time I hear them, and I've been living in Australia all my life!The stunts were great, there were loads of explosions and Ford Falcons being destroyed (much to my satisfaction) and lots of shootouts, but the dialogue was non-existent, the acting was not much better, and the leading lady managed to de-robe herself to the wheezing of various diva tunes on more than one occasion.

All hype, all filler....this wasn't MI2, this was ""Tom Cruise wants to be James Bond, or Matt Helm or Derek Flint, but not Ethan Hunt..""The first movie, ostensibly was centered around Cruise as his team was annihilated and he was the fall guy for the bad guy (Jon Voight). His team before the ""hit"" and the disavowed one after, had some decent plot complications and character interactions...This Turkey (and I do Mean TURKEY..dont bother to stick a fork in it, cuz its been burned) was so OVER THE TOP it was unbelievable...change that to ""non-believable""....John Woo ought to stick to making movies with Jackie Chan and other ""Pacific Rim talent"" than trying to reinvent the wheel on this one. And a royal raspberry to Tom Cruise for helping produce this one too...you can tell what parts he wanted to go into the film, if you have seen a decent number of Woo's films....the sequences with the Girl (Nyah?) useless slow motion shots...reminded me of bad arthouse TV Advertising for the Infinti Automobiles in the 90's.... The supporting cast, is unnecessary and wasted. Considering the gratuitous gunshots, martial baloney and hooey, Who needs a IMF force, with Tom? You could probably drop him on the Moon in his Birthday suit, and he would eventually make his way back to earth..... Folks, this is not Titanic. This is RAMBO 3....without the supporting characters. It a ""ME"" film...Mr. Cruise is a narcissist, plain and simple, and this is the action film that he wanted to play with Mission Impossible. This time he got his wish. There are so many gaffs and goofs (the motorcycle sequence goes from knobby to street to knobby to street tires over and over again...fight scenes last far too long, etc. The packed house that was with me groaned in nearly every scene.Don't get me wrong. I am a TOM CRUISE fan. I own most of his films, all the way back to TAPS. I want him to continue the Lestat series...if he is willing to do a sequel to that....he can go over the top in that one...Lestat did it in the book....But Mission Impossible is an Ensemble Cast effort, that was completely overlooked and wasted in this movie. See it, only if you love Woo's OVER THE TOP style....cuz this is a signature moment for that classification.Sorry, Tom....you should have skipped the sequel curse on this film....",Mission - Impossible II
593,drxym,Snorefest,4,21 April 2002,"Some of the stunts in MI:2 are great but that's all can be said for it. The dialogue is terrible, the plot is boring and the twists and turns are laughably far fetched. John Woo made a terrible career move when he directed this clunker.What plot there is involves stealing a virus before the bad guy can get it but it does so in such a ham handed way that you just don't care. Nor for the zero-chemistry romance between Cruise & Newton. Worse yet, there is hardly any originality here, all the Mission Impossible tricks are ripoffs from the first movie - rubber masks (employed multiple times), computer hacking, dangling on wires, breaking into a building etc. It's just desperate how cliched it all is.",Mission - Impossible II
594,jcroucher,"Some exhilaration, but unsatisfying",6,10 July 2000,"I was expecting to be satisfied seeing a polished John Woo action movie.  It was certainly polished, and there was a lot of action, but the movie was strangely unsatisfying.  Sydney was a strange choice for international genetic terrorism.  The relationship between the two leads lacked chemistry. The chief evil-doer was not really that evil.  The fight scenes and Woo's trademark choreographed action were impressive in the trailers but seemed to go on a few punches and explosions too long.  The film certainly had its moments, some of it was quite exhilarating, but most of it left me unmoved, and that helicopter pilot left me annoyed.  My recommendation: see the trailer three times.",Mission - Impossible II

596,Asimov_X,Mission Improbable,2,15 January 2001,"I rented this movie with three other people and we ended up laughing at it. If it wasn't for the fact that we were all having fun laughing at it, I would have turned it off or fallen asleep. There was NO chemistry between our two romantic leads and some of those corny lines would have done quite well in a daytime soap opera. We all concluded it was the worst movie we had seen in awhile (but at least we got a laugh out of it).Also that ridiculous mask swapping business, this was asking us to suspend disbelief a tad too much. ""Hey I need to imitate the bad guy, I'll just use the fully realistic latex masks I happen to be carrying of both the villain and myself""..geeeesh..The action scenes were good I must admit especially the bike scenes but sadly they could not save the movie. The rest was just too bad. As far as I'm concerned all the special effects in the world won't save a movie if the script, plot, storyline and acting are terrible and believe me all of these were terrible in MI:2.",Mission - Impossible II

598,iamolc,Pity the Middle Child,2,25 August 2007,"It's been said that the middle child often has more adjustment problems than the other two. In film trilogies, even unintended ones like I suspect the MI franchise of being, the middle film often falls short of either the first or the last. A classic example is Back to the Future II, which was as dark and repellent as I and III were attractive and whimsical.MI:II is the film to avoid in this trilogy. MI was intriguing in its exploration of the classic film question ""What if?"" What if Jim Phelps had tired of always being the underpaid civil servant and gone for the gold? Brian De Palma develops his answer in a wonderfully nuanced and compelling way. The scene in which a resurrected Jim tries to film-flam Ethan Hunt is delightful. As Jim describes Kittridge, the alleged force behind all the violence, as tiring of his 60K yearly salary, his rotten marriage, and his obsolescence, Ethan realizes Jim is describing himself and everything falls into place. The later chase aboard the TGV is almost believable.Hardly anything is believable in MI:II. Worse than that, the plot is derivative in the extreme. Besides recapitulating Hitchcock's Notorious, director Woo draws on Star Trek for the opening scene in Moab.....Terminator II for the shootout in the Biocyte lab.....Star Trek again for the infected person who needs the antidote.....Terminator II again for Luther blowing up cars with huge cannon shells. The love triangle is an old one that wastes Thandi Newton's considerable talent. The motorcycle chase near the end reinforces the too-widely held perception that all riders are psychotic yahoos.Still, the film is OK for what it is: A third-rate shoot-em-up. The photography of Australia isn't bad, either.",Mission - Impossible II
599,muntaqaakhan,Mission Lackable II,4,19 June 2021,"When I saw the first Mission Impossible, I loved it. Great Action film. The moment I saw Mission Impossible II, I loved the action sequence,
delivered by John Woo, and the performance of the cast.The problem was the film's story. It lacked screenplay and filled with holes in the story. The film was so predictable. I only see the film beacause of the action scenes.",Mission - Impossible II
600,Apollo_Tweed,A sad attempt at an action movie in the Post-Matrix era,2,25 May 2004,"I borrowed the DVD of this from a friend (whom I no longer speak to) (only joking!).Among other things this movie pornographises violence (as I understand the term) for the sake of cheap thrills by showing that the human body can take so much more punishment than it actually can. There is no way that 2 people can smash into each other at 120mph, then fall 40 feet onto a beach and then stand up and then stand up and have a fight with each other for 10 minutes (unintentional laughter abounds). It sends out the wrong message to kids who might be unfortunate enough to be watching that this can happen. Hopefully, kids are more sophisticated than I think.There is no dramatic tension in this movie at all and the plot, what plot? It self-destructed 5 seconds before the movie began. The characters have the depth of cardboard, which is an insult to cardboard and many good actors, including Cruise, are wasted - Anthony Hopkins appears to be wearing a grin during his scenes that seems to just be saying ""I'm getting $1 million for saying 12 lines and being in the film 3 minutes. I love this job!"".Did I mention the unintentional laughter? This movie has it by the shed load. I kept expecting Charlie Sheen to appear during the endlessly absurd 'action' scenes and Tom Cruise tries desperately to be cool and stylish but comes off looking like a prat. I defy anyone to watch the scene where Tom walks past the burning doorway while the dove flies past and Dougray Scott says ""Run that b*stard down!"" without laughing. I sure as hell did.I liked Face/Off and I generally like most of Mr Woo's other movies but this one should just be flushed down the pan - it is just a 2-hour commercial for crassness and stupidity.I gave it a 2, I would have given it a 1 except for the added entertainment value of the unintentional laughter. You deserve much better than this so don't waste your time or money. No wonder that now, only 4 years after its release it is occupying the bottom of DVD bargain bins. Recommended only for people who thought that 'Armageddon' was a good movie.",Mission - Impossible II
601,kingcooger,Where have I seen this before?,3,19 October 2002,"I really liked the first Mission Impossible film.  It had a very good spy/thriller feel to it and actually seemed more like a Mission Impossible t.v. episode.  This one was okay but it should not have been called Mission Impossible 2.  It's nothing like what Mission Impossible is supposed to be. It feels more like another version of James Bond.  I notice so many are trying to copy Bond these days (and most of them unsuccessfully).  This is a decent outing as a James Bond copy, though it still bothers me that it wasn't just given a different name.  Also another complaint is that all of the mask stunts and even the cigar cutter thing were copied straight from Darkman.  I would recommend that any of you who thought the mask stunts were good to go out and rent Darkman (it's a lot better at pulling these stunts off).  I will give this movie credit for acting.  It had better actors than the typical action film.  So if you want to see this movie then fine but i would still recommend Darkman or just a Bond flick more highly.",Mission - Impossible II
602,tom_owens_182,Serves it purpose.,8,1 May 2010,"Let me start by saying I enjoyed this movie. As my summary suggests, it serves it purpose as being a mindless summer action movie for people to enjoy. Therefore I watched this in the mindset of wanting to be entertained. Not educated.And y'now what? I was thoroughly entertained.First of all, the plot is Cliché no.4, a virus is created and has to be stopped. So nothing original so far. It does provide a basic premise that is easy for many cinemas goers can understand. It depends on your point of view whether this is a wise move or not, but as I've mentioned, people just want action from a movie such as this.The characters serve their purpose but add little depth to their motives or actions. They just seem to do things. We are given some back story into some of the characters but it is not conveyed very effectively. For example, Thandie Newton's character is supposedly a thief with no conscience. This is ""effectively"" portrayed by her driving recklessly and generally pouting. But never does she try and gain advantage of her situation (like a thief would). Why not pocket a bit of that cash for yourself? The camera work and special effects are Woo trademarks in this movie. Especially in regard to the slow motion shots with unnecessary amounts of emotion thrown over like sprinkles.Overall, I would say this movie was always destined to receive the reviews it did. With similar regard to it's box office totals. It was a summer movie action movie staring Tom Cruise which was a sequel of a much loved 1996 spy movie. What could you expect? This movie was never going to undercut The Godfather or Citizen Kane, but it was supposed to make a lot of money. And that it did, and probably entertained a lot of people along the way. It certainly started the 2000's of to a good start in terms of action.So what the hell. Stick your mind in neutral for an hour and a half and enjoy Mission Impossible 2.",Mission - Impossible II

Actors seem uncomfortable as though they are fighting within themselves and appear almost amateurish. The films seem disjointed. They don't flow well. M. I.2 may be the best example. Look at Hopkins .Newton. Gleason even. Rhames. You reckon they put this outing on their C. V's Scott is probably the only one who does!The film itself is the weakest in the series. Not clever. Original, inspiring and drawn out at 2 hours that feels like 2 1/2. The opening scene of M. I.3 contains more credible acting than its predecessor's entirety.",Mission - Impossible II
604,agapesophy,Action Porn.,1,16 July 2013,"The movie has no plot, some people think the movie actually has a plot, it does not, its much like classic seventies porn having endless lame justification for action, what drives the action is meritless. Much like some old porn movie, its not realistic, but it just invents something very lame to get naked and do some action. This movie is no different than a lame porn movie, except most lame porn movies have better plots than Mission Impossible Two. The movie is packed full of action, each action scene is very visually beautiful, however each action scene is nothing more than a plagiaristic cliché from just about every action movie that had any merit. The movie has the creative insight of a turnip or some other vegetable, that has no proved creative insight. It is artistic, however plagiaristic clichés.

I guess it was because of the mixed reaction from moviegoers and reviews but i thought that john woo's style is out of place here and near the end of the film is the best part of it but as a whole a little uneven and one uneven part of it is (what's the tension between cruise & hopkins they never explain it in the film ) but the music is also a little out of place, unlike the 1st( which is far more better in my opinion) and i know it's a different film but to really change the feel of it was too much of a change for me. but cruise once again displays a real focus in another performance.",Mission - Impossible II

Are these fights or outtakes from the X-Games?I supposed the technique is de rigueur in the Kung Fu genre, and it was pretty funny in ""Big Trouble in Little China,"" but I hope this particular trend is otherwise short lived.  It makes the participant look cartoonish and stupid, not what you want from your ""Mission: Impossible"" hero.",Mission - Impossible II
609,theo47,not Mission much,3,28 May 2000,"Can Tom Cruise and John Woo put their respective egos aside and deliver a fun summer spy movie?Mission: impossible.The sky is the limit in the 007 genre, but ""M:I 2"" (ugh, I can't believe I used the acronym) ends up a bloated, retreaded mess. Early proof: Cruise is introduced climbing a cliff, an ooh-it's-really-him-climbing moment a la William Shatner in ""Star Trek V,"" a scary indication of where the movie is headed.The movie then rolls over and dies, desperately in need of an editor and delivering exposition slower than Woo's patented slo-mos. The villain is yet ANOTHER rogue agent - apparently, psychological testing is not yet part of the IMF training program. There is an attempt at a Dougray Scott-Thandie Newton-Cruise love triangle, but the boys are so deadly dull that it's a wonder that Newton gives them the time of day. Newton is all dreamy-eyed, amazing-cheekboned, smirking sexuality; if one good thing comes from this movie, it's that she'll get more work (in better movies). And remember how imposing and dangerous Ving Rhames was in ""Pulp Fiction""? Here, he's behind a laptop again, when he should be mixing it up with the bad guys, right along with Cruise.A lot of familiar ground is covered. The villian apparently saw the first ""Mission: Impossible,"" as he correctly guesses that Cruise will penetrate a high-security building by lowering himself down on a wire. (If he does it again in ""M:I 3,"" I'm walking out.) Then he's a moving blip on Rhames' screen, sneaks around, and blah, blah, blah.Stuff gets blowed up real good when we finally get to the last half hour. We're treated to the same high-flying two-gun John Woo Nutcracker that you've already seen a dozen times before. It's entirely inappropriate for the genre, something the 007 movies have been guilty of as late, also. Our spies used to outthink their opponents and ingeniously escape deadly situations; now they just mow the bad guys down with a submachine gun. Thanks to new back-end deals, Hollywood screenwriters are making bigger bucks now than ever before; the studios should demand smarter scripts.Even so, I'm afraid that even those of you just looking for a summer ""popcorn"" movie will walk out disappointed.

610,Blim,Yuck,3,28 July 2000,"Extremely disapointing. What made it worse was that with John Woo's trademark slow motion scenes we were forced to stare at the boring images on the screen for an even longer period of time.

611,Funkyleg,Pure John Woo C**p,3,5 June 2000,"This movie was terrible.  The plot was laughable and extremely predictable. Woo's attempt to turn Tom Cruise into James Bond was a total mistake, as was his leaving any sort of suspense or plot twists out of the movie.  I mean, what is Mission Impossible (or any action movie) without a few moments where the story takes a sudden turn that you weren't expecting.  The constant slow motion, techno-drenched, swirly camera shots were ludicrous once you realized that most of the action was practically impossible or not nearly as exciting as Woo wanted you to think it was.  Woo's deal is that he tries to amaze you with his camera work in an attempt to divert your attention from the paper thin plot and characters.  And seriously, that gun just happened to be buried at his feet in the sand?  How creative.  To sum up, Mission Impossible 2 is a brainless pseudo-action movie which plods along in a series of slow motion shots and shallow love scenes before exploding into a horribly unrealistic  case study in idiocy.",Mission - Impossible II
612,henny-4,Very disappointing,5,2 June 2000,"Apart from a few of John Woo's trademark beautifully constructed action sequences, this film has nothing to recommend it.  The plot is pedestrian and the writing is disappointing - quite a bit of time is spent explaining the blindingly obvious and supposed ""plot twists"" are telegraphed to the audience so far in advance that you're bored before they happen.  Although the special effects are an improvement on the first movie, this is the first time I have been in danger of falling asleep during a John Woo film.  The representation of Australia is cringingly embarrassing - apparently we all speak with very broad accents, call everyone ""mate"" and hang around sheep farms.

613,Draftback,Exasperating twists and tiresome escapades makes MI:2 a dull boy,2,29 July 2001,"In this action filled flick Tom Cruise and co-stars battle desperately against not only sinister villains but also a hopeless script filled with annoyances and plot holes. ""MI:2"", although making top dollars at the box office I'm sure, only succeeds halfway in being entertaining, leaving large holes in desperate need of filling. Numerous attempts to fill these holes are made using well choreographed action scenes, I'll give them that, and hopeless, yes they are, plot twists. This results in a mildly entertaining movie with a lot more to be desired.In general, sequels to action movies and the likes, such as Mission Impossible, although not winning any Oscars per se, still often manages to be entertaining in the ""Hey, honey, that was an hour and a half well spent, I had fun"" kind of way. However, Mission Impossible 2 does not succeed even at this, and should therefore be left alone.

However, Ethan prevails again and manages to save the worldwide population from total annihilation.Is there a written rule somewhere that summer movies must be loud and violent?  I think that there must be because it seems that all summer movies rely on special effects that are much to flashy, action stunts that are way beyond reality and corny catchphrases that even make Al Gore's seem interesting.I am not going to waste much of my time writing this because the bottom line is that if you like the first one, you are most likely going to want to see the second.  However, if I can save just one movie patron his $7.50, than I have succeeded in at least saving one poor soul from the dripping lameness of this lengthy monstrosity.

615,Number8,All Tom Cruise and little of everything else,3,23 June 2000,"I never understood the first MI movie.  I got lost between plotlines halfway and at the end I was very confused.  Unfortunately, the plot in this sequel also has problems.  This time it is too simple with no twist and no surprises.  I practically could guess what happens next through the entire movie.Second of all this movie is all Tom Cruise.  While Ethan Hunt had partners, their participation in anything is minimal.  Everything happens only to Cruise in this movie, and all you see is Cruise on screen.  The ""team"" aspect is what made the Mission Impossible show so cool.  This movie felt like a spy flick a la Bond, James Bond.Third of all I was not impressed by the action.  Maybe I was spoil by the Matrix, but I think this movie is rather tame in the action department. With John Woo at the director's chair I expect so much more.  There really isn't a memorable action scene in this movie, which is rather bad for a supposed action movie.  Maybe I am just being picky here but I believe that more could be done in this category.Of course, with Tom Cruise in the lead role this movie is a guaranteed success.  I just hope that when the sequel comes out (and I am pretty sure there will be), it will have a more exciting plotline.",Mission - Impossible II

Of course Tom Cruise's character is somehow ""larger than life"" just like Rambo and there are scenes that just couldn't work (for example, when he kicks the gun lying in the sand and it flies directly into his hand) But after all this was an highly entertaining and thrilling flick with loads of brilliantly choreographed action sequences - typical for John Woo. So if you liked Face/Off you'll love this one. By the way, this second installment has nothing to do with the original - so don't care about seeing first one before watching M: I-2 in case you missed it.

Excellent facial expressions, and gorgeous eyes. The Aussie side-kick has a small role, but he's a funny guy. Ving Rhames was definitely underutilized. This movie was about TOM CRUISE.If you're comparing to the TV series, there is one scene you will really enjoy.Overall, I really enjoyed MI2. The plot was mostly simple and predictable, but there were a few times where I thought that I knew what was going on but my wife did not, so the surprise elements really worked.The final fight scene is not to be believed, but it sure was fun to watch!

Do not see this movie even if Tom Cruise rings your doorbell and threatens to wave his long hair in slow motion as he did so often in film if you don't view it. It has absolutely no redeeming qualities about it at all. The tape inside the film's video cassette is to thick to use as dental floss, To long to work as a belt. Also This movie is not only awful, it is a total knock off of Notorious by the incredible director Alfred Hitchcock. The following parts of Notorious were completely stolen and screwed up by Tom: Cary Grant and Ingrid meeting at the race track and her boy friend becoming suspicious of them. Cary seducing  Bergman and then using her in his spy work. Ingrid having to go under cover and marry the bad guy, who is in love with her.

For example, the IMF, the team that worked together through ingenuity and teamwork, has been scrapped in favour of Tom Cruise going solo. Another appealing element of the original M:I was the way in which all missions were accomplished through inventions and situations that seemed far-fetched and realistic at the same time, but in M:I 2, this too is forgotten in favour of 'magic' face and voice changers, that can somehow turn absolutely anyone into absolutely anyone else.Another appealing feature was the way the team consisted of gritty hardworking people, just trying to get the job done, and not worrying about how they looked doing it. John Woo's vision of Ethan Hunt is almost the exact opposite, it often looked like the chase scenes were straight out of a shampoo commercial, and the ""scars"" looked like they were applied by Estee Lauder.In the famous motorcycle duel scene, I couldn't stop thinking about how a member of the original crew would most likely just pull a head fake and double back and run the guy over after he flew off his bike, or just shoot the guy when, near the end, he is caught without a weapon (John Woo opted to have Ethan throw down his weapon. I guess his thinking was: The enemy died, but at least he died thinking ""Wow, Ethan, you fight with honour"").",Mission - Impossible II
625,daniel1974nl,A very typical John Woo movie !,7,1 July 2002,"I just saw another movie of John Woo, called Hard Boiled. Probably one of the most violent movies ever reached the screen. I think thats a trademark of Woo, and not to see in this movie. What is typical Woo is the way of filming, the slowmotion things for example, the release of white pigeons - from Face Off.  I think it shows us what Woo can do with a big budget, which he surely had for this film. Woo is and remains one of the actions experts of Todays Hollywood. Look forward to see his next film Windtalkers.",Mission - Impossible II
626,tubley,Barely watchable and insulting,3,1 April 2009,"First of all, what is with the somersaults?? If I had to choose something that annoyed me the most about this movie, I'd have to go with the somersaults. WHY so many damned somersaults? They were completely unnecessary and annoying? Overall, this movie shows a profound ignorance of the culture, language and geography of the country it was set in.Australians DON'T say ""mate"" every 5 seconds, nor do we have such a ridiculous accent. John Polson, as an Australian you should be ashamed of yourself, showcasing Australian English in such an idiotic and exaggerated way, quite different from how you speak in more respectable films, such as ""The Boys"" (great film).Note: ""Downtown Sydney"" is NOT in the middle of the bush.Let me say it again, ""Downtown Sydney"" is NOT in the middle of the bush.At the time this movie was set, the population of Australia was NOT 17 million. You're about 3 million short. Now, 3 million may not seem like a lot in a country such as, say, China. But 3 million would be more than one seventh of our population. That's a huge factual error in my opinion, and one that could have been easily resolved by 2 minutes of research.My point: If you're going to spend millions of dollars making a movie, get the facts right.The attitude that was shown by Luther and Ethan towards ""this guy"" (the Australian) was horribly arrogant. The Aussie was cast as a damn painful fool that the other characters seemed to look down upon. But the real foolishness was the presumption that we could or should believe half of the outrageously far-fetched action sequences crammed into this pointless film.",Mission - Impossible II
627,toolate8,All gunfire and no substance!,1,15 May 2006,"Mission impossible II is undoubtedly one of the ten worst movies ever made; with the exception of the climbing sequence, at the beginning of the film, it is completely without excitement or any other merit. The endless stream of explosions and gunfire is a poor substitute for a plot or for interesting and engaging characterization; this is not an action movie, it is more like a small-town fireworks display. The female lead comes across as having as much personality as a sack of wet fish; what little she does say is delivered with all of the emotion and enthusiasm of a fast-food order. Mr. Cruise is a competent actor; however, you would never know it from this film--nobody would have been able to deliver a compelling performance, considering the insipid dialog, abysmal writing and first-year film-school-caliber direction, in this mess. The gimmick, with the masks IS cute and would be a nice addition to a movie, which contained some real intrigue, however when it is as over-used, as in this film, it is only silly.There should be a secure institution, located far away from Hollywood, where untalented writers and self-indulgent directors, like the fools who created this garbage, can be locked up and kept from bothering the public with this kind of silliness.",Mission - Impossible II
628,Wayori,Alfred Hitchcock called. He wants his movie back.,3,24 August 2008,"I was tempted to check the ""Contains spoiler"" box before writing my comment, reason being that if you ever watched Alfred Hitchcock's ""Notorious"", you have already watched this movie. Well, to be fair, there's the face-switching and explosions and inferior acting to the previously mentioned masterpiece that make Mission: Impossible 2 a little different. I don't know if any lawsuits were brought up during the release of this film, but they should've been for the cheapening of a Cary Grant classic. I would think that a sequel to such a ""notorious"" action film would have just a little more originality. Had the plot not have been already used, the score would be a 6/10. The action was a little fun, and the face-switching never gets old. But with the knowledge that this movie is a blatant rip-off, the experience is a little depressing.

629,jillvesta16,Tom Cruise Stars in an Action-Packed Infomercial for Rubber Masks!,3,9 July 2013,"Did you enjoy Mission: Impossible 1 and got excited when Mission: Impossible 2 came on your TV? Well, if you're one of the few people left that haven't seen it yet, STOP! What you are about to see is another demonstration of how sequels can manage to vary greatly from the originals.I'm not a Mission: Impossible hater, and I don't despise Tom Cruise as an actor. I loved Mission: Impossible number bajillion. Okay, 4, but who's counting? MI:3 was fairly decent. The original was awesome. But this one was just disappointing on all accounts.The original Mission: Impossible was so good because of its complicated plot. You had to think. And it moved quickly. This one started out okay, but with a pulling off of rubber masks, it doesn't take us long to figure out who the bad guys were.Cut back to Spain, where Ethan Hunt takes a break from climbing rocks and spends about 20 minutes attempting a so-called relationship with a ""mysterious"" thief. He also has great talent at delivering unforgettable lines (""Just stay alive!"" and ""I'm not gonna lose you!"" were especial favorites of mine and very thought-provoking) and incredible skills at martial arts (refer to the impeccable fistfight scene at the end).Along with these awesome additions, we get multiple bad guys! Multiple explosions! An unlimited supply of rubber masks utilized over and over again! Absolutely useless cameos by doves! Honestly, it was just an overdrawn mess. The movie lasted about 40 minutes too long, and by the time you brought all of the slo-mo scenes to regular speed, that 40 minutes would easily be spared and we could return to a Chimera-free lifestyle more quickly. The characters (or lack thereof) furthered the borefest. Luther seemed to be recuperating (perhaps from reading the dull script), and this new no-name sidekick had about as much personality as a sack of potatoes. Nyah started out as your typical ""mysterious"" character and ended as your typical ""implausible"" character, all but whimpering at the edge of a cliff as the countdown to the virus' infection of her wound to, yes, the near end. But don't worry! They'll save her, as this film is nothing short of predictable. The villain(s) were just forgettable.It's a great difficulty to stop the spread of Chimera? What are we talking about?

630,killy_nl,Great action movie,8,6 April 2005,"This is one of my preferred films. Although I am not a fan of Tom Cruise, I think his role playing here is excellent. The first ""Mission Impossible"" was OK, but not convincing (e.g. the helicopter stunt in the tunnel). But this one has beautiful pictures, impressive stunts and a suspense atmosphere. Just take a look at the opening scene, when Tom Cruise climbs up the cliff: fantastic colors, great view, very good sound background. I like to sit back and enjoy this scene on my 100 cm 16:9 TV again and again, pushing my surround-receiver to the limit. Another great scene: the car-ballet between Tom Cruise and Thandie Newton (it is a pity to see these car crash ). John Woo did a really great job here as director !",Mission - Impossible II

The narrative is the same in any action film (good guy triumphs over bad guy). The acting is quite good, the normal Tom Cruise superhero, a good turn by Thandie Newton as Nyah Hall and EXCELLENT acting from Dougray Scott as Sean Ambose the main villain of the film due to his mean attitude to everyone.The action is excellently derogated the Hong Kong MASTER of action John Woo. There is a shootout,short car chase, a motorbike chase and also lots of hand to hand fights,plus a Fantastic score by Hans Zimmer .This film is worth watching but if you are a fan of John Woo and you want to see a excellent film of his go towards his original Hong Kong films (The Killer is the best one). Better hurry up before the third comes out.",Mission - Impossible II

But no... it wasn't hot at all.  It was in fact a disaster. Less than half way through the movie I knew there's too much slow motion shots and that just ain't cool.  It becomes annoying.  The shots are all too close up, up to the face kinds of shot, and that ain't too good either, especially for the action sequence.  Plus too many of those slowing down during an action scence, for example the car chase Tom chases the girl, when their two cars got close and it slow motions then the boy looks into the girl's eyes, plus that music, oh man is it nasty! I gave it 3/10",Mission - Impossible II
635,thewatcheruatu,What happened?,4,27 May 2000,"What was this movie? It wasn't Mission: Impossible. It was kind of like a very poor attempt at James Bond, with a little more kung fu thrown in for good measure. The only problem was, apart from the action sequences -- and I will confess that John Woo directs some very inspired fighting sequences -- this film had no point. Why was it made? Why did Tom Cruise allow this script to be filmed? And why did he buy into the very popular misconception that John Woo knows anything at all about directing a coherent film in the English language? Let's look at this closely, shall we?Mission: Impossible belongs to the spy-thriller/espionage genre. If you take a look at the previous film or the television series, I think you will find them easy to classify. This...well, this was some kind of weird hybrid, save the world, over the top action, explosion, car chase extravaganza. I don't know how to classify this. All I know is that this wasn't a spy movie. It had nothing at all to do with espionage.But perhaps more than anything, however, the success of the Mission: Impossible franchise relies upon the interaction of the ensemble casts. Sure, Cruise was the obvious star of the original film, but he would have been nothing without great support from the likes of Ving Rhames, Jean Reno, and Emmanuelle Béart, all of whom played integral roles. Who the hell did he have in this movie? Okay. Ving Rhames is back, but why? He was a piece of furniture, placed in the film to make a joke here and there about wardrobe or sheep dung. That Australian guy? Who was he? I don't even know his name, that's how unimportant he was. Anthony Hopkins? Why was he in this movie? And how much did they pay him for his 3 minutes of screen time? Thandie Newton was actually quite good in M:I-2, but like all the characters, she wasn't a person. Just somebody for Cruise to react to. The relationship between them was entirely unconvincing, and more than once, she simply served the function of a catalyst for some sort of future action which would, undoubtedly, make no sense.Woo wanted to give Mission: Impossible a heart? Then why are all of the characterisations so poorly done? The villain is just a raving lunatic and everybody knows it. John Voight's disgruntled and unappreciated civil servant mentality from the first one made more sense. Why in hell did IMF use Ambrose to double for Ethan Hunt? They had to know he was unstable. Cruise is super-man. He can do anything. No longer is he the smug spy that he was in the original film. He's Jet Lee. He's Chow Yun Phat. He's anyone but Ethan Hunt. Woo never really even attempts to establish a believable character or limits for this character. The whole rock climbing scene? What does this say about Ethan Hunt? Please. Don't get me started.And the whole thief with a heart of gold thing has been done better about a million times. I have no reason to believe Nyah would fall in love with Hunt, and Woo doesn't seem to care that he never bothered to explain how that happened.The plot? Whatever. This movie had no plot. The only attempt anybody made at recapturing the espionage feel of the series, was the obvious rip-off of the Langley scene from the first film. In M:I-2, Langley happened to be Biocyte or whatever it was called) headquarters, but the scene completely fell flat. The suspense so deftly created by DePalma in Mission: Impossible is nowhere to be found, as Woo seems to just let his effects do the talking.Not a horrible movie, but a tremendous let-down. Don't go into this film expecting Mission: Impossible. Go into it expecting a mediocre action film that really accomplishes nothing and basically serves no purpose in ever having been made.",Mission - Impossible II
636,agray,Almost bad enough to recommend just for how bad it is,1,26 May 2000,"I remember thinking about 20 minutes into it ""Okay, the acting is terrible, but the plot's okay"".  An hour into it I was thinking, ""Okay, the plot sucks too, but the action scenes are good.""  By the end, even Woo's trademark ""bullet ballet"" couldn't redeem this movie. The entire audience was laughing at just how cliched and obvious this movie was.  I go a long way on ""suspension of disbelief"" when watching action flicks, but this movie ate up my reserves and left me on empty well before the grand finale.  It became a game to see JUST HOW MANY tired cliches they could fit in at the end.Except for the fact that characters actually DIED, the stunts and action seemed better suited to the A-Team than to a modern thriller.  It would have been far more effective if it at least had Mr. T and George Peppard -- or better yet, Peter Graves and Leonard Nimoy -- people you EXPECT to see in cheesy over-the-top cartoonish tripe like this.Maybe the low budget of Hong-Kong films is a GOOD thing.  I usually love John Woo movies, but if this is what happens when he gets his hands on a major studio budget, I wish he'd go back to the chop-socky stuff that made him famous.This movie is almost bad enough to be recommended on that score alone.  It's no Plan 9 From Outer Space, but it is stupendously awful.",Mission - Impossible II

MI2 is nothing but a bad attempt to make a bond-like movie: mission failed on all but one points. The camera work was good, but -like the rest of the movie- too slow.What's the point of stressing the fact that action-scenes are not realistic by slowing them in slow motion?What's the point of having a female counterpart in the movie if she does not contribute to ANYTHING in the movie? (apart from the obvious, she being a babe)I must say, it is possible that I missed some relevant information because I fell asleep in the first part of the film.Let's hope the director of this movie knows that this movie attracts people only because the prequel was OK.

The rocking soundtrack plays over the credits, so don't expect that during the film. This is a let down, as i was sitting there waiting for a little Limp Bizkit to rock the cinema! You have to put up with some shoddy semi-operatic tosh instead.Also, avid watchers shall study poor continuation, with irrelative angles being used for the same conversation. This happens twice. Dougray Scott talks to Thandie Newton in the back of a car, and some lovely dubbing with no cheekbone movement (normally required for speech) is heard and not seen.

Other than that, there's lot of neat action stuff, some cool motor-bike scenes and some fighting that made me wonder if I had accidentally gone to see ""The Matrix"".If you want to see a good action flick, see this one.

I haven't seen anyone remark on the similarity of the plot of MI-2 to the plot of Hitchcock's ""Notorious"" (1946, Cary Grant & Ingrid Bergman). Both feature a male spy falling in love with a less than virtuous woman. Both have the male spy reluctantly asking his new love to seduce an old boyfriend for the sake of the cause. And both films even feature scenes at the racetrack where the woman meets up with the male spy to pass him information. Of course Hitch didn't have quite the same action punch. ;)",Mission - Impossible II

I go to the movies to enjoy the hard work that the cast and crew put into their films. This is one of those such films. I will openly admit that I have not liked all of the films that Tom Cruise has done. To be honest I wanted to see Shanghai Noon the day I saw MI:2. But as soon as I sat down and the movie started I was quickly on the edge of my seat. For I will have to say that this is definitely the best Movie I have ever seen Cruise in.I thought this one was much better than the first. I thought the first one was a little too dark and gloomy. I actually found myself not able to take my eyes off of Cruise and Scott.This is only the second film I have seen Scott in. The first being Ever After.

MI:2 Comes through better than I had expected.  Jon Woo's influence upon this movie is readily seen via the action sequences (which raise the movie to new heights in the Action genre) and while the storyline at times formed slowly or incompletely (The first 30 minutes or so) through gratuitous action, I'll admit I was completely entertained.",Mission - Impossible II

Tom Cruise's smoothness and remarkable compusure are qualities that I wish dominated my personality.  The abilities of the characters to use super computers and computer chips to constantly monitor people seems too far-fetched, but in the Mission Impossible movies it strikes me as too cool.  When I criticize movies, I tend to argue that they are too implausible or their characters achieve feats that in all likelihood would have not happened realistically.  However, when I see a film like Mission Impossible 2, I put aside these criticisms because the ambience of the movie encourages these ""impossible"" scenes and characters, and makes them entertaining to watch.  From every bullet that miraculously misses Cruise to the satellite which monitors the whereabouts of the villains, I just enjoy the whole fantasy of the film.  Of course, any fantastical movie is hindered if its plot is too ridiculous or unbelievable, but the intricate storyline of Mission Impossible 2 interested me almost as much as the incredible fight scenes and car chases.  The plot of this impossible movie is much better and more cleverly crafted then the plots of most movies that try to project a more realistic atmosphere than Mission Impossible 2.

Of course keep in mind that the 1st one had no plot, and the fact that this one HAS a plot makes it much more interesting.  Tom Cruise does a pretty decent job, although if you want to have fun count the number of unnecessary flips he does in the movie.  The quintessential villain isn't all that great an actor, but he does his job so its believable.  However, Mr. Woo, we dont need 10 sequences in the movie where Tom and his leading lady stare at each other for 2 minutes in slow motion making faces at each other.

This film manages to avoid that pitfall, offering a plot that can actually be summed up in one sentence. In the spirit of not giving the plot away, I will forego writing that simple sentence. Just be assured anyone can follow the plot without too much trouble. The stunts are spectacular, and it appears as if Tom Cruise does a good deal of his own stunts, enhanced no doubt with a large amount of computer enhancements. Thus, my only criticism: A stunt has to look as if it is possible to actually pull off in real life. Most of these did not. You truly must suspend reality, and accept the superhuman feats which Ethan Hawke manages to pull off.And oh yes, Mission Impossible still has the greatest theme song ever put forth in a film.",Mission - Impossible II

There are 30 people shooting at him and he manages to take care of everything without getting hit or hurt.  And then he is moving fast and good as in Matrix.

Second Let me mention this movie did NOT fail because it is a sequel I believe, but it insults the audience.Mission Impossible 2 has great music, great sound, great actors and intriguing ideas yet shallow Story line.  But the complaints come from 2 parts.  The story line is shallow and then it is repeated. there is enough flashbacks in this MOVIE (which they seem to forget they are making) you might think you were at a Grateful Dead concert, and some of those flash backs intertwining two different dialogue.  It is hard to tell what is what. Is it so hard to remember the FIRST scene? why do they insult the audience that way, not all of us are morons.  Then they remind us of the MAJOR key scene in the final fight?  Why do they call us idiots like this?  It is sad.But that is not worst they could do.  There are some GREAT action moments, unfortunately they are ruined by the over use of one major special effect, SLOW MOTION!!! This movie's action scenes each have a slow motion.  If the producers saw Matrix they could understand that slow motion might be good in moderation, but the way they use it in this movie, it is like over using crack?  anyone else notice that?  What are they hiding.... the fact the action only takes up about half the time it seems, maybe less.  They just want you to think it takes up more.Then there is the romantic story?  again? the producers are morons.  We don't want to know romance. Action movie watchers want Sex, Violence, and Blood, And not too much romance but there is too much romance and talk about romance, and not that much skin.  I don't care if someone wants to protect someone I want to see them do it, oops I just remembered, they screwed that up too.Don't go to this for any reason unless you NEED Tom Cruise or you will die. Other then him the only redeemable quality is the fact it is a John Woo Flick. or maybe the use of Slow motion (you better love slow motion)Finally my recommendation? Get Matrix, and watch it again (always a good movie, and better done), or for theater fanatics go see Gladiator (great action flick and expertly done) or go to this awful movie and hope not to get p***ed off at John Woo's big bomb.",Mission - Impossible II

The plot itself is completely laughable..but then its supposed to be...the action scenes are totally unbelievable...but again, they're supposed to be...and the film itself moulds together like badly mixed cement, yet I walked out of the cinema grinning like Tom Cruise with the knowledge that John Woo had done it again, made a film out of nothing. Ive read a lot of criticisms about MI2, and completely understand them, however youve got to remember that this film wasnt made for the oscars, it was made to sell, and it sells itself very well.

651,blondemusicpuffin,Leaves a bit to be desired,7,15 June 2000,"I was worried as I headed into the theatre.  Last time I tackled one of these Mission: Impossible movies my comprehension of the plot turned into my own impossible mission.  I'm an eighteen year old girl, I don't get all this spy stuff.  Yeah, I'm pretty much there to see Tom Cruise.  I tried enjoying the last plot, but I was confused beyond ""duh.""  So, I sat down and decided to do my best with what I was given.  And surprise!  I got it!  Of course, understanding the plot does not mean that the movie had me at the edge of my seat.  In fact, the plot was rather tired by the time it reached me, seeing as how it had paraded through countless other movies and novels.  But!  I was still entertained for the two hours.  The stunts and music kept me happy, and I remained puzzled throughout the film wondering how a person could actually have such perfect skin (thank you Thandie).  So-- the idea is of an impossible mission.  I should think if a director or writer wished to show how the fabulous Ethan Hunt could carry out the impossible mission, he would try to make everything as realistic as possible to amaze the fans. However.  This one ranks up there with Star Trek in the realism department. Instead of glorifying the spy techniques of Ethan Hunt, it expounds upon Tom Cruise's Kung Fu fighting moves.  Who cares if he could really disguise himself as the bad guy in twenty seconds or less and get away with it?  He had makeup artists!  And a very imaginative writer.  Wait and rent this one, unless you wish to enjoy Tom or Thandie on the big screen.  Entertaining, but leaves one saying ""Yeah right.""",Mission - Impossible II

654,Andres-33,"Great movie, if you don't expect much...",7,17 August 2000,"To tell you the truth, I did not go to see this movie expecting to walk out of there with the answers to the world's mysteries.  Nor did I expect it to be another Schindler's List or Shawshank Redemption.  I expected this to be an action movie, with lots of stunts, exaggerated sequences, explosions and cool gadgets, and this is exactly what I got.  Director John Woo did an excellent job, although I got a little tired of his trademark slow-motion takes.  And the music was superb!  Some of the stunts were hard to believe, and I definitely said: ""yeah, right"".  But then, you I found myself thinking: ""that was cool!"".

655,bogiefan-2,Predictable plot twists and over-stylised directing,3,7 January 2001,"One expects films like M:I-2 to be cut from the same cloth as the James Bond series - with some justification.  The film has suspense, exotic locales, gorgeous women (well, woman), lots of gunfire and assorted pyrotechnics and other gadgets.  This one even has a semblance of a believable storyline and the opening rockclimbing sequence was pretty cool.Where M:I-2 lost it for me was in the overstylized directing by John Woo which at times took on almost campy tones.  His use of slow motion shots (particularly of pigeon wings flapping) irritated me and the overlong fight scenes with an obvious martial arts twist did little for me either.  Any of these devices used sparingly might have been interesting but Woo's overuse of them made me pay attention to the devices at the expense of letting myself go with the suspense that I should have been feeling.The acting was okay and the character development consistent with movies of this genre (you are told their backgrounds and hot buttons from ""mission briefings"").  The script was alright but its plot twists were way too predictable and none of these twists really took the storyline where it didn't appear to be going anyway.If you like this genre of film, go ahead and see it - there are far worse out there.  If you're lukewarm or not crazy about this genre, then you should probably stay away - of course, you're probably not apt to read this review anyway.",Mission - Impossible II

If you want to give this movie 1 star , where the hell does Arnie's ""Commando"" come on the ratings of ""laws of realism do not apply"" films and as for any of the Bond films when it comes to a realistic plot... well. Personally, this film is an exciting action movie with plenty of visually awesome stunts, quality soundtrack and a couple of nice surprises. Where this film does loose points with me though, is the cheesy slow mo scenes and lines. It really does badly interrupt an otherwise great action movie, which you should see. 8/10",Mission - Impossible II

I'll complain but I try to remain objective. That said I must begin by saying that I actually fell asleep during this movie. The first, third and fourth of the M:I series were great but this one was so painful that I almost bypassed M:I 3 on the principle of this movie alone.I can't give too much detail as I have only seen it twice (I gave it a second try on VHS when it came out and it was just as bad) but compared to the spy vs spy intrigue and plot twists that made the others so fun this movies was so straight forward it was less M:I and more attempt at a summer action movie to rake in a couple million before the real summer blockbusters show up.As I try to stay positive, I will give it two things: 1) The action sequences, while nothing like the other movies, were very stylized and in any other film - like Face-Off - would have been enjoyable. 2) Doves. Not the doves themselves, but they really had fun trying to be stylish with their cinematography. Any they succeeded in many cases I recall, they just were NOT good for this movie. To compare, try to imagine Wes Anderson directing The Bourne Identity...It was for those two reasons I gave it a 2.

659,eyehaveewe,Appallingly bad trope-fest,4,28 August 2015,"This is one of the stupidest 'summer BlockBuster films' I've ever seen. Where something like Independence Day might be campy, overblown, and poorly written, at least someone bothered to write it.Mission Impossible II never bothers to flesh out its characters or give them any personality, other than the film's 'Bond girl' whose eye- candy enough to keep the movie from being completely boring. For example, one of the main 'good guys' has an Australian accent. That's it. That's his whole character.The main plot could have easily come from CSI: Miami. All the writing is just an excuse to show more and more stunts and a few lackluster explosions. The acting is appalling. The writer has no idea how to write banter, and the acting coach doesn't know how to get people to say it. Even Anthony Hopkins seems to have forgotten how to say words in this movie, and its incredibly distracting. Hopkins in particular, actually, seems to be hamming his way through a local business commercial. At one point it did have me, and I could excuse the Joel Schumacher style antics (I""m quite surprised he didn't direct MI:II). The female lead is convincing enough at first, and Ethan Hunt's method of recruiting her draws the viewer in. But then we go on to realise even she has no personality, just the old 'I'm a female thief' motif. This movie actually expects us to identify the characters with tropes and just let it go.Where it really lost me was the ever increasingly outrageous fight scenes. At one point, the movie goes into literally a 26 minute chase scene followed by a 6 minute hand-to-hand combat scene. I'm guessing they had about 30 million dollars left in the budget and decided to spend it all on an extra 30+ minutes of stunt doubles flipping about and bikes doing wheelies. Serious, for that entire length of time there's 2 lines of dialogue between the ughs, bangs, and booms.It keeps no consistency. One minute we're joking in the middle of a fight, the next Hunt is almost gruesomely decapitated by ...a rusty car bonnet... and the next the merciful good guys are laughing at a car full of enemies blown to pieces and sinking into the sea. MI:II is not trying to communicate anything in tone. That's mainly because many scenes are straight takes or homages to other movies and do not mold well with MI:II's campy blockbuster vibe.On the upside, though, it has good cinematography when its not idiotically zooming in objects and faces, showing flashbacks of events that happened 5 minutes ago, and cutting away from action to save from paying for an actual effects/stunt department (instead of the film school students they seem to have hired to pump out this trite). Let's call this one an excuse to watch a 26 year old Thandie Newton make faces at the camera for 2 hours.",Mission - Impossible II
660,kennethcarino,Diagnosis: This needs an antidote for clichés and plot holes stat!,6,16 July 2015,"Mission Impossible 2 is a bang on movie. Judging from the rating and reviews, the sequel to the first classic Mission Impossible film is not well received but who cares when you really have nothing to do just to pass time and it's not a bad thing in itself; movies are essentially to entertain us. Mission Impossible 2 is just that, a good fun action movie that is entertaining and catered to mass audience who may essentially want action on its own with less talky and less smart narrative.The movie is directed by John Woo and it opens up with a scientist narrating the myth of Bellerophon and the Chimera from the Greek myth. In this case, chimera is referred to as the virus while Bellerophon is obviously the cure. As with many spy and action movies terrorists are trying to acquire the virus and the cure and as always it is up to Ethan Hunt (played by Tom Cruise) to stop them. Without spoiling much of the story (though it is obvious), the plot and twists were actually less than what it seems and as such it is what kept the audience interested long enough though it fell short. The first half has been interesting and tense enough but nothing compared to the first Mission Impossible movie. There are wires, jumping and split second hazards as the first movie but were not expanded and fell short. After the second half of the film it became rather tedious and too predictable action with no depth. The cinematography was for me is less than average. There were too many annoying and unnecessary slow motion action scenes like Ethan Hunt turning around to shoot a guy after barely escaping from a bunker facility. There were also some plot holes by which, if had been patched, the everything would have been solved already. In that sense, it is probably intentional just for the sake of action but if you see the plot holes, as an audience it will kind of ruin your viewing experience of the film. Of course, the movie does not want you to think but just watch passively and enjoy the killing and shooting and all the silly actions that John Woo presented. I did enjoy them enough but I cannot unthink what I saw!In terms of acting I thought the casts were good and Thandie Newton and Tom Cruise were good together but their relationship together was not developed well enough and was forced in an instant. They did not have a strong chemistry which I felt was for the sole purpose of having an obligatory love interest. I would think that it was probably so that the movie could focus more on traditional action. One major criticism I have on one of the actor was of Dougray Scott who plays as the villain Sean Ambrose. His character was very one dimensional and unconvincing, a very typical action movie villain. There were was a brief scene where he was shown to have a rather more humane and sensitive side but that fell short too similar to the plot. Now having said this, I cannot say if Dougray Scott could be blamed or the script. More than likely it was the script's fault because watching the final product it appears to be the case. Similarly, near the end, the character of Ethan Hunt slightly suffers from one dimensional action hero where he finally unleashed the action hero archetype: unkillable and still active despite countless body traumas he has suffered and no bruises too.Mission Impossible 2 is a good average action film and so if you have not seen the movie don't expect too much and don't think about it too much. Just try to enjoy the movie as it is and it is not as bad as many people claim it to be. The plot and narrative do suffer from the classic action film virus: predictable and silly action, one dimensional villain, death defying superhuman protagonist, obligatory chase scenes and love interest. Indeed, MI2 is afflicted with action movie cliché flu and it needs its own Bellerophon: a huge dose of better writing. Though the diagnosis is too late because many people have caught the flu and they either did not survive watching the movie and hated it, or they survived and liked it. Well I fall in the survivor's group and liked it. But let me be clear: this does not mean however that I would watch the film the second time to catch another flu. The next sequel Mission Impossible 3 clearly cured the story and treated all the symptoms.",Mission - Impossible II

It has its moments of comedy, a romance, and a lot of great action scenes. Might I also add that the score is AMAZING? The part where Nyah injects herself and says ""You're not going to kill this bitch,"" to Sean is literally on-the-edge-of-your-seat good. The music during this scene is so beautiful, I literally watched this part over like 25 times! Like I said before, this film is not intended to be a smart, twisty thriller like the first one was. It is simply an action movie that is intended to get your heart pumping, and the twists that the first movie had are replaced with beautiful music and great action. Enjoy it for that.Cast-wise, I thought Thandie Newton was fantastic. Her face conveys so many emotions and her voice is so addictive. Tom is great as usual and Dougray Scott is a perfect villain. Smart, witty, and dangerous, but not too menacing.Overall, I think this was the best of the entire series. MI1 was too confusing and not really that exciting, MI3 was kind of random (Phillip Seymour Hoffman is NOT a good villain, I just can't take him seriously!), and MI Ghost Protocol was great too, I just like this one better.9/10",Mission - Impossible II

Mission: Impossible 2 is one of the best action movie to come across the silver screen in years.The first offering in this series was marred by an over complicated plot structure that made the movie difficult to follow at some points. The plot elements of MI2 were simple enough: A deadly German virus is about to reach the open market and wreak havok on the world as we know it. Ethan Hunt is charged with assembling a team of specialists to keep that from happening, including a beautiful professional thief. The execution of the plot is amazing. It shows a much more human side of the character and focuses more on the love story aspect of the movie than your typical action pic.Then there are the action sequences. Tom Cruise is a total bad ass. Motorcycle chases, car chases, rock climbing, gun fights, hand to hand combat, knife fights and cool computer stuff, all executed by a very attractive leading man.

This whole film felt like a parody of a John Woo film, taking every stylistic aspect and blowing it WAY out of proportion. However, it was beautiful to look at. The script in the first film was filled with wild plot twists which were given no leadup whatsoever, simply justified afterwards. In my opinion, a good twist is something that leaves you slapping your forehead and berating yourself for how stupid you were for not figuring out beforehand. M:I-2 give you leadup alright. Again, I got what I wanted, but too much. The ""twists"" were inanely predictable, offering no challenge for the audience. In one instance I guessed the ""twist"" a full half-hour before it took place. Before the lead up even took place. For me, the script left me feeling just as hollow as the first one did, only the technique was different. I really have been harping on this film rather harshly- it had some very good points. The acting was terrific pretty much all around, the cinematography was simply stunning, and the action was, of course, truly amazing. But it never gripped me. It never sucked me in the way great thrillers like Fargo, The Usual Suspects or pretty much any Hitchcock film have. I never felt any of the characters were in any danger, and worse, I just didn't care. See it, but leave it for a matinee or the dollar theatre. They don't need your money anyway.",Mission - Impossible II
684,egan_shawnp,Classic Tom Cruise film,6,27 May 2000,"Tom Cruise really scored with this film. This was one of his best performances, and it definately boosted his stock for future films. I've always considered Mission Impossible as an Americanized version of the James Bond series, and the selection of John Woo(Face Off) to direct this version was brilliant, and John Woo made this film a lot better than the original. It does start off slow, but as the film progresses, it really gets better and it ranks up there with 'Jerry Maguire', and the best type of theater to 'experience' this film in is a theater that has stereo sound. For all Tom Cruise fans out there, this film is a must see...the action is really exciting and for the most part, the story is pretty solid. If your a fan of the Mission: Impossible series, you won't be disappointed. Sir Anthony Hopkins small part in this film was quite impressive. It is really worth the price of admission, and truly defines a classic action film...",Mission - Impossible II

I love Die Hard, Highlander, The Hunt for Red October, ...Second thing, I like most of John Woo's work... recently saw Face/Off and it was quite good. The Killer was awesome. Hard Target wasn't bad considering it had that awful Van Damme.But then, I nearly fell asleep watching Mission Impossible II. It's just plain boring! I don't mind if it's not physically possible, but if you go that way, go all the way (The Matrix, the original MI's 'copter inside tunnel sequence, ...); there were no action scenes who moved me an inch. There is just the motorcycle chase scene (maybe the best in the movie) and the lab shootout, and they are too short and well, not too spectacular!Were not for that, I could forget the laughable acting, I would enjoy seeing Miss Newton, who is quite beautiful. I would enjoy the Lalo Schiffrin theme. But it was SO boring!",Mission - Impossible II
687,CitizenKiryu,"A great comedy, but it was unintentional.",1,25 May 2000,"I was looking forward to seeing M:I 2, but was terribly disappointed with what I saw.  This may have been one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The action sequences were overblown, as I expected with John Woo in charge, but they were too overblown even for Woo.  The mask gag was done waaaaaay to many times.  But those were not the worst things about the movie.  Nothing could ever be cheesier than the dialog from this movie.  Almost every line was some kind of Arnold-style catch phrase.  Stuff like, ""Well, we just put a snowball in hell, let's see what chance it has.""  One can only take so much of this.  So please, save yourself the time and money and skip this movie.",Mission - Impossible II
688,cruisinxx7,bond ripoff. well not that bad..,5,27 May 2000,"Before I commence with my actual opinion, I make it clear that I have not seen the original series (but I have seen the MI movie) so I won't refer to it or decide on how ""classic"" it is. Now, I do say that it didn't seem to catch the element of ""teamwork"" that pushed my interest in the original MI forward. Ethan Hunt goes on a solo mission blowing up stuff and finds a girl whom he must save. This is, in short, a James Bond ripoff. In fact, while I nearly dozed off during the ""plot development"" scenes, I almost forgot this was indeed Mission Impossible. No, I'm serious. But that doesn't mean it's bad; I'm a good fan of Bond movies, but I came to see the everyone-work-together-to-save-the-day type of movie, and I got James Bond and two guys whose roles revolve solely around getting their computer to work (and flying helicopters and firing one rocket to blow up a car. once).
The love interest isn't believable at all. Unless you're a romance sap, have a crush on either Tom Cruise or Thandie Newton, or don't pay attention to love elements of a movie...you are going throw back your head, close your eyes halfway, and think about how much movie is being wasted away on this...well...waste. They meet, Cruise plays around with her to show off (like the security alarm scene when she was sitting on top of him. nice camera angle..almost qualifies for an R rating), they do stuff together for like a week (or maybe a month to be generous) and then Hunt becomes obsessive (""I won't lose you NOOOO!!"" come on its not even like their 3rd date). To accomplish such a task Woo compromised valuable action time to this element that shouldn't be in Mission Impossible.Lastly, the chase scenes are cool, the gun scenes are cool, and the fight scenes are cool (cept some moves are faked. like Cruise could do THAT). Action-wise, it was delicious (mmm). The technology was cool too, but what bugged me was the revival of the pull-face-mask turns that are supposed to surprise us into shock or somethin. Well, not to sound boastful, but when I watched the movie with my friend Dave, we predicted every single mask-pull at least a couple minutes in advance (except for the very first one). What I'm trying to say is, if you're not gullible, it won't surprise you. So if you like surprises, don't think too hard. Oh, and if you quit IMF, do you get like proprietary Ethan Hunt masks or somethin? Or maybe each member gets somethin like Insta-face where you can design a facial model on a plaster case with hair in seconds. Don't worry, I'm not ruining the movie for you. You won't know what I'm talking about until the very end. Oh, and when semi-trucks hit cars, why don't they ever stop? They side ram a $100,000 car and it blows up and they keep driving.",Mission - Impossible II
689,guybrush105,How about doing some research before making a movie?,4,9 July 2000,"I'm a big DePalma fan and I loved the first Mission Impossible despite what the critics and Jay Leno may say. The plot wasn't that hard to follow, the acting was great and Tom Cruise played a vulnerable though smart and resourceful agent named Ethan Hunt. He was involved in this huge mission with expert secret agents that weren't any worse than him, with the exception that they weren't the main characters and therefore the movie didn't focus on them that much. However, MI:2 or whatever you wanna call it is some bad spy flick which doesn't have anything to do neither with the first movie nor with the TV series. Ethan Hunt must be dead or something because the character Cruise plays only shares the name in common, for he's a completely different person. (Since when does a self-effacing character like him kill all the bad guys himself and work alone? All Ving Rhames and the other guy do is shoot from a helicopter. And now comes my biggest complaint. I'm Spanish and I've lived in Spain my whole life, so I do know what this country is like. I recall a James Bond movie with Roger Moore in which he goes to Madrid, which was nothing but a bunch of white houses with Mexicans (who must be fed up with Hollywood mistaking their country with the utterly different and boring Spain) leaning back against the walls and some ancient bus with a sign on it which said ""Madrid"", as if it was the only bus there was in the city. Apart from that film there are many other American movies which depict Spain as some third-world country full of South Americans, whom I respect a lot but who don't have absolutely anything to do with Spanish people. But these were all old movies and I thought Hollywood had learnt to do some research before setting a movie in a foreign country. I was, however, wrong. The first few minutes (after the climbing scene) take place in Seville which looks nothing like that kind of a Mexican ""Hacienda"" we see there. Sevilla is a city, and it looks just like Paris, Vienna or Rome. People wear regular clothes, they don't go around dressed up in those weird outfits shown in the movie which aren't even Spanish. (Some of them are, though, but from a different part of Spain)  I remember Anthony Hopkins saying that locals burn their saints as he looks out the window and watches some weird ritual which is supposed to be a ""national Spanish feast"". Then we see people dressed in real regional Sevillan costumes (but they're just regional though, people don't wear them on the streets, it's like those green costumes Austrians have), people dressed also in regional Valencian costumes (which would never be found at a Sevillan feast, since they come from up North) and some other folks wearing dressed that come directly from the imagination of the costume designers. Then we see them burning wooden statues of saints in a huge fire in the middle of a square, and they all move around like zombies. That doesn't exist!! People don't burn saints in Spain, and they don't walk around as if they were possessed by the devil. And the worst thing is that it's supposed to be a religious feast. Don't worry foreigners!! We don't do that, we're normal people just like you, that wear the same clothes as you do, live in buildings just like you and probably think like you!!!  Maybe the thing of the fire comes from a non-religious feast that takes place in Valencia every year where people light fire-crackers just for fun and there are spectacular fire-works. But it's just a show, that's all. Something for the tourists.  Then I was also surprised to see the supposedly locals speak with a strong South American accent with a touch of Arabic (Two beautiful accents that don't have anything to do with the Spanish one, and besides Arabic is a different language)and also not a single blonde or white skinned person. Hey, people in Spain are blonde, red-haired, brunette, etc. I myself am blonde. And we aren't dark-skinned (even though we try hard to be, since it's very sexy and fashionable skin color. To top it off, some of the sentences in Spanish the locals said weren't even right!!
  Besides these comments on my country, I have to say some of the action scenes (like when Cruise goes into that building tied by a rope suspended from an helicopter) are great but the movie is nothing but non-sense and it's not ""Mission impossible"" at all. And I wanted Ving Rhames and the other guy to do more stuff, let alone the girl, whose being a professional thief doesn't seem to help her at all. Mr. DePalma, please come back!!",Mission - Impossible II

The plot is way to predicable, but instead of an original plot the scriptwriter decided to personalize the film by adding suspense, a lot of violence, and some humor and romance.

693,Wonderland-4,Could it have been worse??,3,18 June 2000,"Upon entering the theatre, i had a couple of ideas already in my mind. The first was that i loved the first Mission Impossible film and knew that it would be hard for the sequel to match up with it in quality and entertainment. Secondly was the fact that the sequels director, John Woo, wasn't going to turn out anything like Brian De Palma in the first instalment.Both mental projections of the film came true.Try to imagine a film that tries to be the most over the top film of all time and this is what you have. Every action sequence seemed as if it was tacked on to the film as an afterthought, which was important because otherwise it might have outdone the appalling script, and one thing we like to see in film is continuity.It is said that to watch a John Woo film you have to put your brain into neutral - i think more appropriate for MI:2 would be to put your brain in reverse.Tom Crusie tries hard and should be respected for it - but i think it is safe to say that martial arts should be left to the professionals (Jet Li). This and so many of the other action sequences leave Cruise looking nothing short of unconvincing.I cant really say it's worth a look - but certainly do if you are having trouble sleeping - it nearly did the trick for me.PS - Australians do not sound as they are portrayed in the film.",Mission - Impossible II

I have read almost all of the reviews of this film attached to this site, I must say that I am very disappointed in the extremely negative reviews. Who are you people and why the hell do you go and see films like this when you should know before you see it you will not like it. It's not like the movie has been a big secret right until release day. Then you seem to think that we all need to read your comments on how disgusted you were with this or that or the whole thing. I have some advise for you. STAY AWAY FROM THE MOVIES. you are just some self important wannabes that think everyone wants to read your comments before going to see a movie. GET OVER IT. Why don't you guys try writing a review with some constructive criticism, Thats if you somehow think that you know how movies should be made.

When I go to a movie that's a take-off from a TV show (in this case, one that I loved), I want it to at least carry some of the essential features of that show forward.  True more so in MI-1: not true here.  Could've been a Bond flick if I hadn't seen the title.  Went back to see MI-1 on video, and realized how much better that was.

698,trainnvain,Inferior Sequel,6,9 November 2000,"Let me state first that I'm not a big fan of the John Woo style.  Having heard some good things about this movie I went in with good intentions, though.  But after a strong first half-hour or so, this movie goes straight downhill.  The standout member of the cast was clearly Thandie Newton, and her scenes with Tom Cruise had a strong chemistry, I thought.  But as soon as her role trailed off after the opening hour, the movie went straight into rote action-movie, big stunt mode.  The plot is virtually just a device for the usual Woo scenes.  I felt he brought a great sense to the relationship between Newton and Cruise by his use of camera style and angle, though.  He ought to do a romantic film instead of getting typecast with his five minute fight scenes and over the top action trickery.I'm somebody who loved the first Mission Impossible more than most(I guess) and liked the way DePalma directed it as well.  I never found the plot confusing, while I found the sequel's just boring.  All in all, if you like Woo films, there's something for you here.

699,therobsterman,"VERY GOOD AND JOHN WOO DOES IT AGAIN, but...",7,27 October 2000,"I have 3 a couple of reasons on way this film prevented itself from being BRILLIANT! I. TOM CRUISE (Why was he given the lead role in the first place, he is no way and never will be an action star!) II. Those few moments that were really stupid and obvious on what was to happen next, such as the car chase on the side of the cliff, the mask change between Ethan and Hugh which resulted in Sean shooting his best friend many times! I knew straight away (before I saw the finger) that it wasn't Ethan Hunt, but Hugh Stamp! And of course, the moments when Ethan chucked the antidote for CHIMERA to Ving Rhames' character and managed to kick up the gun from the sand, go down and kill Sean Ambrose! Which is absolutely impossible, considering the amount of time he had and how close Sean Ambrose was behind him! Maybe that is why the movie was called MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II III.

700,NOSbooster,Trill Ride of The Year,10,23 January 2001,"At first I was very hesitant in seeing this movie. I Didn't enjoy the first one very much, I was unpleased with the way Tom Cruise portrayed his character, and I was very lost at some points in the movie, in fact it still had me guessing after I bought the DVD and watched it some more. But I finally dragged myself to theater to see it and was blown away. The acting was 100% better then the first, the story was easy to believe in today's society, and a good story at that.  The action as well as the dramatic and love scenes were very well shot. The writing was good and let you get to know the characters so well that you could almost believe this was a true story. I think the fact that Tom Cruise did his own stunts made you want to like this movie because of the effort it must have taken. Dougray Scott is the man for the job as his character `Sean Ambrose' no one could have done better, the chemistry between Sean and Ethan is incredible, as well is the chemistry between Ethan Hunt (Crusie) and Nyah Hall (Thandie Knewton) they both light up the screen with their performances.  Some people say that this movie was too predictable and didn't keep people guessing but me and a lot of people I know disagree. This movie will keep you biting your nails and completely still as you see the action sequences. This movie brought me back to the theatre 5 more times. I gave it a 10 of 10.  All around, this was the best movie of 2000. Definitely worth seeing and buying!",Mission - Impossible II
701,cmmdrangelus,"A Visual Masterpiece, Fine Action movie",10,7 October 2001,"First of all let me say that to compare this film to the first Mission: Impossible would be a mistake.  Both films are different in delivery, storyline and technique. MI2 has incredible action sequences, though difficult to swallow.  But then again it's just meant to be a fun movie and if that's what you're looking for it delivers. The film completely is completely focused upon Ethan Hunt's mission.  Unlike the first one built upon intrigue and his need to clear his name, here Ethan is again the point man for his imf unit and the story completely centers around a mission to acquire a stolen item.  For those who complain that this movie is focused excessively upon the character of Ethan Hunt, where it should have focused on the team aspect, i can only say that i don't really understand the complaint.  Hunt is the point man, team leader, whatever you choose to call him and as such the other members of his team take on a supporting role which i think Ving Rhames again captured perfectly.  Even in the first one most of the action centers around Hunt as his entire team is killed a few minutes into the picture. Going back to the film the assault on Biocyte sequence is the highlight of the movie providing great action sequences with a killer score product of Hans Zimmer.  This is not an intellectual movie but it has a nice story line that provides an excuse to be entertained by action and more action and incredible visuals.  Even the most unbelievable stunts in the final fight between Ambrose and Hunt are easily forgiven as they visually stun the viewer and are carried out so effectively that you can just sit back and enjoy.",Mission - Impossible II
702,itf-65501,20 years later...,4,10 November 2021,"I did watch Mission Impossible 1 & 2 shortly after each film's initial release on DVD. In the 25 yrs since M. I. was released, I've probably re-watched it 10-ish times. I saw M. I. 2 once circa 2002. And aside from those limited engagements, I had not watched another film in the M. I. franchise until 2 weeks ago (Nov. 2021). Now as that does deserve an eye-roll, I am happy to report I am all caught up through Fallout (special thanks to Paramount+). So, 2 weeks ago I began w/ Ghost, next Rogue, then Fallout, after that M. I.3 & just finished re-watching M. I.2 for the 2nd time. (I've watched M. I.1 enough for the time being). Now, thinking back 20-ish years to my initial viewing of M. I.2, (and surely my perspective & judgement has been influenced by my recent viewing of the highly successful sequels), I still gotta say it...M. I.2 is kinda a crap film. Almost laughable at some points, Cruise was definitely going through a Zoolander ""Hansel phase"". The bad dialogue and had Woo for the time just discovered the Slo-Mo setting on his camera, cuz he couldn't help himself apparently. The first 5-ish Slo-Mo sequences look kinda cool, but by the finale fight on the beach it's tedious & repetitive and has zero gusto. All this stated, it's very unfortunate because the story itself (NOT the characters mind you), the story could actually be one of my FAVs among the series. Quick note, one ingredient to these action flicks that I find annoying and unnecessary (Independence Day, Transformers & Armageddon come to mind) are these action sequences that go on & on and I guess are fun to look at but the sheer implausibility factor kills my enjoyment. Now, I'm not saying I compare Fallout to Transformers, but I will say the finales of Ghost Protocol & especially Fallout were just a tad outta bounds in terms of plausible (that ""helicopters on the edge of a cliff scene with the hook that keeps slipping and then miraculously catches itself on another jagged rock edge no thicker than 1 inch and yet can still sustain the weight of 2 helicopters & 2 men""...really?) almost ruined it for me, but I'll take the high road and say I did enjoy Fallout. Point is (and back to M. I.2) the story was simpler, yes, but that storyline about Chimera is a great basis and good formula to base a film on, it just was not executed well, at all.",Mission - Impossible II
703,campboy_tc,Stylish nonsense,3,12 January 2002,"I've heard that John Woo shot a load of action scenes and then tried to fit them into a film. I don't know how true this is, but it would explain a lot, particularly the early rock-climbing scene. The plot is predictable and silly (and overexplained, probably because the original was (unfairly) criticised for being confusing), involving a deadly virus and lots of people pretending to be other people with the help of rubber masks. Naturally, things get heavier when Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) falls for the fast-living criminal eye-candy (Thandie Newton). Newton's character brings the only real feeling to the film, and only at very few points is this anything more than a load of action scenes very stylishly shot (and very typically Woo, so no real surprises) but inexpertly cobbled together into a film.As someone who's indifferent to the whole testosterone action stunts involving good-looking film stars malarky, I give it 3 out of 10. Up or downgrade that by as much as 2 points if you have stronger feelings.",Mission - Impossible II
704,wsg31987,Now it's time for explosions and gunfire!,7,1 February 2016,"""Mission: Impossible 2"" is to ""Mission: Impossible"" what ""Aliens"" is to ""Alien"". Which is to say, it's almost nothing like it.The first film was a mystery. This film's plot is mostly known before the opening credits. In the first film, Ethan Hunt subverted the enemy with masks, floppy disks, and laptops. Here, he does it with Berrettas, Glocks, and grenades. In the first film, Ethan is an all American overachiever. Here, he's a wannabe James Bond.In short, the first film was directed by Brian De Palma, and has his style all over it. This film is directed by John Woo, master of guns and doves, and it's one of his most creatively un stifled American films. How much you enjoy this movie is pretty much dependent upon whether you find Woo's signature blend of slow-motion gun play, campy melodrama, and unlikely bird nests enjoyable or not.It's certainly fair to say Hollywood wasn't kind to Woo, and this was his second to last American release. Indeed, this film seemed to make Woo a household name, and it's filled with all his hallmarks, which were largely ridiculed afterwards.Worthy of ridicule? Probably, but hardly unenjoyable. Displaying even more debt to Alfred Hitchcock than the original film, this one ""borrows"" entire scenes and dialogue bits from Hitchcock's Notorious. Ripoff doesn't do it justice. This is an unlicensed remake.Now, there are worse films you could rip off than Notorious. Unfortunately, both films premise of a woman going undercover at the request of her government agent lover to spy on an ex-boyfriend with nefarious plans isn't helped here by the ludicrous relationship between Tom Cruise's Hunt and Thandie Newton's character. James Bond-ish sexual innuendos and ""fooling around"" is somewhere along the line confused with romance. They exchange bad sexually-charged puns, get in a car chase, get laid, and five minutes later they're having lover's quarrels like an old married couple. It also doesn't help that the two have no chemistry whatsoever.The only thing holding the film's central premise together is Dougray Scott as the film's villain, and Newton's ex-lover. While Cruise and Newton flatline, Scott looks like he's having way too much fun playing his renegade IMF agent as one part Bond villain, one part Hannibal Lectre, and one part abusive boyfriend. He's a butt-hurt psycho with a snarly grin and slightly unfocused, dead eyes. He sells the entire love triangle even though he's only one third of it.Whereas the first film subverted the structure and characters of the TV series, this film seems to be content to just ignore it, and be an adaptation in name and rubber mask only. Like the first film, this is not an ensemble, but a star vehicle for Cruise.Back to the story... Hunt is climbing a cliff in Utah without a rope for fun when a helicopter flies by and shoots a pair of Oakley's at him. He puts them on and receives his mission: help uncover the truth behind the theft of samples of a deadly virus with the help of a professional cat burglar who looks like a supermodel. Later he learns from Anthony Hopkins the thief is in fact the ex-lover of a rogue IMF agent who's stolen the virus for unknown reasons. She is to seduce her still obsessed ex, while uncovering why he would want this zombie apocalypse inducing virus in his possession.The first 80 minutes of this movie are dedicated to character development and plot. Perhaps not terribly faithful to the old TV series, it at least switches things up from the first movie by at least attempting to develop it's characters. Sure, Cruise and Newton fail, but Cruise isn't any worse here than he was the first time out. And again, Scott is excellent.Luther Stickell is back, similarly likable as he was in the first film.It's when you hit that 80 minute mark that the film takes a turn, and the rest of the movie sees John Woo cutting loose with nonstop car chases, gun fights, and a bizarre motorcycle jousting match which turns into a kung-fu fight.Not that any of this is unenjoyable. Whether you are invested in the love story or are laughing at it, whether you are thrilled by the action sequences or slapping your knees because it's all just so ridiculous, the film is undoubtedly entertaining.Much as I wrote about the first film, this one was under appreciated. As the 2000s would wear on, M:I-2 is commendable for it's old-fashioned stunt-work in lieu of CGI. It's particularly noticeable when compared to the next installment, which opts for the digital over the practical. This movie was in many ways representative of the end of the old way of action filmmaking. And it's a thrill to watch, however ludicrous.",Mission - Impossible II

707,rpan,Bored to tears!,1,16 October 2005,"Very rarely do so many people say so much praise to so terrible a movie like this one. It was so painful to sit through the movie simply because I don't understand it at all!! I was bored to tears so I left in the middle of this movie in protest. I have been watching movies for over 40 years, good ones and bad ones, but this one is a real dud ranking at the bottom of my ""worst ever"" category. What twisted plot is this? I think Tom Cruise and the other actors had a tough time trying to make the movie watchable but failed to do so. my time and money are totally wasted! Me buying a ticket to see the 2006 MI III? Well, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE!!!",Mission - Impossible II
708,johntinebra,Not bad,5,10 April 2019,If I am honest it is not bad just too much slow motion. Every action scene and it cuts weirdly so not sure about it just the slow motion is too used once or sparingly is good not every fight scene,Mission - Impossible II
709,LilSpiel-2,Worst Movie Of The Year 2000,1,8 January 2001,"What a disappointment. I've asked myself a million times, ""How did they screw this up?"" It had everything going for it. Tom Cruise, John Woo, Thandie Newton...but not a page of decent script. Woo seemed to sleepwalk through his direction and what the hell happened to the Ethan Hunt character? Where did he go? This is not the same Hunt from the first film. I don't mind a transition in character but let me see it for goodness sakes. I also agree with an earlier post about the Newton character. Strong at first and damsel by the end. I rarely want to actually walk out on a film but my girlfriend was enjoying it and I wanted to see if it got any better...well...Paramount owes me $7.50.",Mission - Impossible II
710,Sisi,extremely tedious,5,3 June 2000,"This was an extremely boring movie...the last quarter of the film had some excitement to it, but it was not entertaining enought to justify the first three quarters of the movie. I was also incredibly bored by the performance (or lack thereof) of Thandie Newton. She was in the majority of the film but only had about 15 lines. I grew rapidly weary of her just standing there, not saying a word, supposedly looking breathtakingly beautiful and noble....give me a break. Save yourselves a few dollars and wait for it to appear on video as this movie was not worth the price of admission.",Mission - Impossible II
711,Bradhfx,How about Mission I've Seen it All Before,5,30 May 2000,"If you've seen the trailer then you've seen the whole movie. Don't go to this one hoping for a great story with twists and turns like the first MI. John Woo's slow motion direction style made a slow movie even slower. Someone should inform him that once you use the same special effect twice or more to provide a twist to the movie you shouldn't continue to use it over and over. If people couldn't see what was coming in this one well before it happened then they must have been asleep. One other tip for Mr. Woo, from watching his fight sequences I believe he must play Tekken 3 too much. If anybody has ever played the game you'll know what I mean. I'm sure Dougray Scott is kicking himself for passing on the role of Wolverine in the upcoming X-Men movie for the role of such an easily forgotten villain. I guess that's it, I did give it a 5 out of 10 before writing this comment, but as I wrote it I couldn't really think of a reason why I gave it such a high score.",Mission - Impossible II
712,unfrickinbelievable,What were they thinking?,4,30 May 2000,"So much potential wasted.  Mission Impossible 2 could have been a great movie.  Story was fine, Thandie Newton is hot, Tom Cruise kicks butt, and the action sequences were exciting...at times.  Unfortunately at other times the action sequences are laughable and over-stylized.  At the Chinese theater in Hollywood on opening night (when I saw it) the entire theater was laughing at the movie because it was so bad at times--times that were supposed to be dramatic and serious.The ruining of the movie is helped by the long slow parts that drag on and on; the contrived shot-gun romance of the leads (that left everyone wondering what the heck just happened); and the dependence on the same plot-device over and over for ""twists"" that just come off as obvious, confusing, and/or ridiculous.I wasn't expecting Mission Impossible 2 to be more than an explosive action movie with a relatively thin plot...I was prepared to just have fun with it, since I like these kind of movies.  But in the end the bad parts overwhelmingly outweigh the good.Save your money for Shanghai Noon--it's well worth it, and loads of fun.",Mission - Impossible II
713,rupatop,At least I understood it.,2,24 May 2000,"I saw this movie thinking that they would learn from the mistakes in the past. In away they did. Instead of making a plot which requires about 5 viewings to understand what's going on, they made a plot which you can leave for about half the movie and still follow. I did enjoy the action sequences, although very unrealistic, but then again who goes to an action movie for realistic fights. This movie takes full advantage of the willing suspension of disbelief and requires you check logic and physics at the door while you watch too. I say, go watch this movie only if every other movie is sold out and you have nothing better to do than waste a few dollars.",Mission - Impossible II
714,Kevin-142,Where was the spectacle?,6,28 July 2000,"Considering this movie cost over a hundred million bucks, where did the money go? Cruise's salary one must presume. In a blockbuster like this I like to see some spectacle - the helicopter case/explosion in M:I-1, 747's exploding like in Die Hard 2. But this movie seemed to have the production values of your average TV movie. We didn't even see the plane crash at the beginning, just a cut away to the opening titles.A decent motor bike chase just isn't enough to save this movie from being moribund. Woo showed a lot more Hollywood style energy in Broken Arrow and Face/Off.Watch those again and forget M:I-2.",Mission - Impossible II
715,eightPICTURES,An action movie...nothing more.,7,25 May 2000,"I saw the movie before reading any of the reviews.  When I got around to reading them, they were mostly negative.  John Woo has shown that he knows how to direct an action sequence, and his films are beautifully presented; the action scenes promise to show the audience something fresh and inventive (although some things can get tired by the end of the film) and they are shot with excellent clarity and a distinct style.  I've heard complaints about character development and the motorcycle sequence toward the end of the film.  If you want to see a movie with substance, go see Gladiator or watch American Beauty again.  If you want to see Bond with more style and less Denise Richardson, see M-I:2.  Action movies with character development are few and far between (I can only think of True Lies and Die Hard off hand).  Plot development in this film is mediocre at best.  But the action is what you paying for. M-I:2 isn't as good as Face/Off, in my opinion John Woo's best effort since his American debut, but far better that anything else since 1993.Alex Geiger",Mission - Impossible II
716,mplewis,Absurdity and eye candy with not much else,6,25 May 2000,"This movie is basically the dumbest of all the latest action flicks, with the exception of Battlefield Earth.  There are some great stunts, and then more great stunts, but no character development or genuine dialogue.  We are supposed to know everything about the Cruise character from his past action movies and assume that he and the ""impossible-girl with no lines yet plenty of slow-mo screen time"" fall instantly in love during the one night they spent together.  The first installment will go down as a much better film because it at least tried to create a plot that drove the movie instead of creating a series of absurd action scenes to drive a plot.  Also, the fighting scenes look like a poor man's Matrix and Woo, as usual, makes himself noticed with overly sylistic shots.All in all, an entertaining movie if you're willing to leave all reason and expectations at the ticket counter.",Mission - Impossible II
717,elastica,A huge disappointment,4,4 June 2000,"Absolutely the biggest disappointment of my moviegoing career. I love John Woo. I love his original Hong Kong stuff. You can't say Hollywood spoiled him because Face/Off and Broken Arrow still kept it up. But this is horrible compared to everything that I have ever seen from him, including Bullet in the Head. The dialogue is flat, cliche and boring (thank you Mr. Chinatown Robert Towne), the acting is bland and unbelievable (thank you ""smiles too big"" Cruise and ""I should have just been Wolverine"" Dougray Scott) and the action is too far into the movie and too bland. I kept waiting for Tom Cruise to rip off his face and reveal that he is Chow Yun Fat and start doing some real action sequences. Watered down for a PG13 rating, the action hardly interested me at all after I sat through a film full of implausibilities (even in the world of the film), Cruise smiling like an oaf, Scott grimacing to look mean, and countless other absurdities. You know its bad when the people in the theater are laughing at the supposedly dramatic and romantic moments.My only hope is that the great Mr. Woo will be able to redeem himself in the future by going back to what he does best.",Mission - Impossible II
718,crossfire,John Woo is back!!,10,27 May 2000,"When I first heard that John Woo was going to be directing the new M:I movie I got really excited.  The combination of his stylish directing and Tom Cruise's incredible acting really made me anxious to see it.  I have to tell you i've never seen better action directing out of John Woo.  He finally returns to the insane action he had in ""The Killer"" and ""Hard Boiled"".  I was truelly impressed by the beautiful directing he did in this movie.  He seemed to kind of ease back on it in ""Face/Off"" and ""Broken Arrow"" but John is back with his stylish and crazy action.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of John Woo or the action genre.  I give it 8 out of 10.",Mission - Impossible II
719,artdeco-2,"dull, unoriginal - a series low point",2,29 May 2000,"First, let's get one thing on the table: I think the first ""Mission:Impossible"" was superbly crafted by Brian De Palma, who used his balletic camera style to heighten suspense and beautifully frame several stunning set pieces. The plot, unfairly maligned by many with limited attention spans, was intriguing, with surprising twists. I think it was one of the best films of its type.""M:I 2,"" on the other hand, is a dull, plodding affair with little suspense. Everything seems recycled and unoriginal -- a bit of ""Notorious,"" a bit of ""To Catch a Thief,"" a bit of James Bond, all mixed in a base of Hong Kong kung fu movies. There is nothing you haven't seen before (and done better). It depresses me that some actually prefer this ""dumbed down"" version of ""Mission:Impossible"" to the much-superior first movie in the series.The camera work is cliched, with John Woo repeating himself (in slow motion, of course). The script, what there is of it, is quite poor, and Woo (who did much better work in ""Face/Off"") gets performances from his actors to match. Cruise is Cruise, and the rest of actors are either ill-used or turn in hammy performances. Anthony Hopkins tries what he can with his few minutes of screen time, but unfortunately it's all made up of worthless speeches with no interaction to speak of. He's essentially a variation of M in the Bond series and little more.Although I've never had any problem suspending disbelief at the movies, this one goes too far in having us check our brains at the door. The face mask trick is overdone and entirely unconvincing as used here. The bike chase at the end, which seems to be getting the most praise, is hard to enjoy because it is so wildly unrealistic and not much more than a series of stunts strung together.All in all, I can only hope that this is a low point in the ""Mission:Impossible"" series and that the franchise will return to the level established by the first movie in the next one.",Mission - Impossible II
720,dantwo,Mission: Disaster,1,29 May 2000,"One of the worst films of the last few years.  The premise of Mission: Impossible was always great story lines and ingenious plots and escapades. Unfortunately this move ignores all of that and makes the movie one long over the top action sequence.  The plot (what there is of it) is contrived. The dialogue is extremely minimal, with a lot of holes.  With no plot to hold the movie together, one must rely on the action to get through this, but it is too much.  If you were to eliminate all the slow-motion effects, the movie would be reduced to half its running time.  Save your money",Mission - Impossible II
721,forrest_e_caruthers,Been there and seen that,6,4 June 2000,"Most of the reviews gives the movie such high praise and it is at the top of the box office list right now, but I must say that I am surprise that most everyone finds it to be so good.  The reason I say this is because I did see it also, I did enjoy it and the special effects were cool, but it seemed to be a move where thirty percent of it was put together from ideas created in other movies.   Case in point.  In the opening scene where Ethan Hunt is on vacation and IMF has to track him down to send him on another mission.  They find him rock climbing.  The special effects for the scene were very good and only someone with a death wish would have made the leap the character (Mr. Hunt) did in that scene, but guess what.  Paramount Pictures did the same opening scene in a movie called Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, where Captain Kirk was on vacation and the Enterprise tracked him down to send him on another mission.  They found the Captain rock climbing in Yellow Stone National Park.  This movie, Star Trek V came out in 1989.  So I expected MI2 (2000) to give me something different from what I saw 11 years ago.  There are many other stolen scenes as well in MI2 but I won't talk about them because I want to leave something for others to talk about.    The plot from the bad guy point of view does hit the mark when you apply the same theory to today's reality.  Although I don't think many of the previous reviews have picked up on that fact yet or maybe someone left it for me to talk about.  The idea is this, a new deadly virus has just been created, so lets steal it and the antidote, introduce the virus to the public and sale the antidote to a pharmaceutical company for fifty or sixty million dollars and let them resale it back to the public.  In other words people will pay through the noise for legal drugs that will give them a cure, and in today's world with AIDS and Herpies they are paying out of the other end for a promise of a cure.  Do you think this idea is just a coincidence or maybe that some things that happen in real life are carried over into movies?    There and three leading roles in the movie and they all do an excellent job under the direction of John Woo.  They are the reason it does so well at the box office, because without them it would be just another made for TV movie.",Mission - Impossible II
722,Impamo,This movie tries too much...,8,26 May 2000,"In no way this sequel is better than the first movie or the series. It lacks the tension, the plot and the intensity of both. The stunts may be amazing but it's to much... The motocycle jump over the bridge is clearly computerized and Tom Cruise's ""i'm doing every stunts man!"" attitude is grabbing our attention more than the movie itself. Even the battle scenes are looking weak for those who saw ""Romeo must Die"". The best thing to come out of this movie (and it's a consensus) is Thandie Newton. It's a great summer flick but it's not quite an accomplished mission",Mission - Impossible II
723,larsde,Waiting for another Matrix? Keep holding your breath.,6,25 May 2000,"MILD SPOILER ALERT.Mind you, there's not really all that much to spoil.While there are some good action scenes, it just doesn't stand out from the crowd anymore. First ten minutes are pretty cool. Showdown is also pretty cool.They're pulling their punches in the fighting scenes, it's just not the violent ballet that I know and love.Maybe my expectations were too high from watching the preview, which pretty much shows all the action, from beginning to end.The plot is pretty much non-existent. You expect a movie of this caliber to have twists and turns. The most twisting it does is when some character pulls a mask off. Intelligent? Not really. Not at all, actually. What's up with those masks, anyway? This isn't the sixties, you know.The actors did a pretty good job, both hero and villain. Heroine also passes, as does Hopkins. The rest you can pretty much just forget about.Verdict: Too little action, and the little there is just isn't mind blowing. Too many masks.",Mission - Impossible II
724,tyler_durden15,Suspension of Disbelief,2,26 May 2000,"Never before had I seen a movie with so many generic action scenes, so much poor dialogue, and so many flaws in it. M:I 2 is the worst movie I've seen since Battlefield Earth. The action scenes were so overdone that it surpassed laughable and went right into sad. The stuff with the pigeons in the old deserted fort was kinda funny though. The dialogue was just your average horrible Hollywood writing, probably done by some sort of animal picked out of the primate section of a zoo. And then there's the flaws. I know its just a movie and we're not supposed to take it too seriously but, how can someone blow a man-sized hole in the outer wall of a skyscraper, stand eight feet away and not feel it? That and the absurd scene with the masks in the final part are just a couple frustrating flaws. And when did Ving Rhames turn into a fretful grandmother? There's so much to this movie that I hated, it would take me another day to type it all down. Just please don't waste your money.",Mission - Impossible II
725,dpfeffer,What a supreme waste of talent and my money.,3,27 May 2000,"What a terrific way to kill a franchise. Take everything that worked from the first film and replace it with slow motion shots of Tom Cruise doing back flips.This is less a film than it is a monument to the amazing egos of John Woo and Tom Cruise. The brilliant break-in of the computer lab at Langley in the first film was included as a homage to the great heist film ""Topkapi."" Every scene in this film, however, was included as a homage to itself.Get this: This evil Australian pharmaceutical company invents a killer super virus and its antidote, so they can unleash the former and sell the latter at an exorbitant price. But here's the catch: the virus kills the infected after 20 hours...which doesn't really leave too many people around to pay for the cure, does it? Hell, you come up with a bad cough and you'll be waiting in the doctor's office for half of that amount of time.Or did I miss something form the ""plot,"" which is entirely possible because the entire thing was told so poorly and with such confusion that I'm surprised I managed to follow any of it at all. Who the villain was, for example, or what were his motives was never explained even in the slightest. He was a rogue IMF agent, I guess...but didn't that happen in the last film too? What is it about the IMF team that makes its agents go not just crazy, but completely, absolutely psycho-Hitler style crazy? You'd think they'd hire a psychiatrist to give these people psycho-evaluations or something.But it is illogical plot devices such as this that fuel bad action films, and that is just what this film is. It's really unforgivable, really, considering the supreme talent that was involved.But, Donald, you might be thinking, what do an intelligent plot and engaging characters have to do with a kick ass action movie? If the action is there (and, for the most part, it is. The action sequences in this film are really top drawer) then the film is a success, right? Wrong, not when the film in question comes from a pedigree such as this, where an intelligent plot and engaging characters are the norm and should be a given. The first movie and the original series deserve better than this. Tom Cruise proved himself to be a great producer with the first MI, hiring DePalma and some great actors to create as witty, exciting, and suspenseful a spy thriller as Hollywood has ever scene. But in this film he hired an over the top director with little to no experience with the genre and some great actors, sure, but with absolutely nothing to do.You might question why Anthony Hopkins was hired to act in this movie for only about three minutes. Allow me to tell you why: Because only an actor of his caliber could deliver lines like, ""This isn't Mission Difficult, this is Mission Impossible. Difficult should be a walk in the park,"" and *not* have audience members jumping from their seats, out to their cars where they'll either go to Blockbuster to rent the first film or straight home to catch an episode of the original series on TV Land.This movie sucked, pure and simple, and had as little to do with the first film or the original series as I am to Hercules. Gone was the brilliant interplay between the ensemble cast. Hell, gone was the brilliant ensemble cast. Emilio Estevez had more screen time than the third member of Ethan's team (that australian guy) had in this one.",Mission - Impossible II
726,holdncrt,John Woo redefines the Mission Impossible series,9,25 May 2000,"The first MI was tired, but John Woo pumps new live into this series. Supplying the audience with non-stop sweat and action.  His signature round-house camera angles capture some amazing fight sequences, especially on motorcycles  Mr. Woo rocks.The cast Cruise, Newton,Scott and Rhames provide a glamorous flavor to this stunning action movie.  I hear Cruise did his stunts...if this is true the man is a true action hero warrior, able to defy gravity and reality at times.The only compliant is the love story.  The chemistry between Cruise and Newton is hot, but the story line is a little drawn out and secondary to the action and the mission.

Then You'll LOVE M:I-2!!",6,27 May 2000,"What I loved about the first Mission: Impossible was the intricacy of the plot and the unpredictability of the actions of the characters.  The sequel contained none of these.  The ""bad guys"" were one-dimensional and the plot had all of the unpredictability of a Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan comedy.John Woo has long been one of my least favorite directors.  I like the occasional action movie, but Woo's work is so pompous and self-indulgent it makes me want to puke.The character of Ethan Hunt was also very inconsistent from the first M:I, where Hunt is a ""business-first"" spy, who shows emotion but does not let it conflict with the task at hand.  Yet in the sequel we see him getting jealous about his thief girlfriend having to perhaps sleep with her ex-lover.  Give me a break!I hated John Woo after Face/Off.  This isn't nearly as bad as Face/Off but still horrible.

The only saving grace were the bikes (I am partial to Triumph's, best riding machines built). I think this movie requires quite a big suspension of disbelief among action movie buffs; the violence is at times too 'cartoon-ish', in a 'Con Air' kind of mode.  Woo resorts to his good-guy/bad-guy showdown before the credits roll like he did with 'Broken Arrow' and 'Face Off'.  The man is getting predictable, which is a polite way of saying he's downright boring these days. I felt cheated of the $9.00 I spent seeing this film, which is nothing more than a travelogue for Sydney and New South Wales. I predict that Tom Cruise and John Travolta will have their work cut out for them drawing fans in the next ten years.",Mission - Impossible II
730,Noodles-34,Horrible!,1,28 May 2000,"Call it what you will, this film was TASTELESS! Not only was the bad guy a mix between Scottish, Russian, British, and German, but the violence! Personally I belive John Woo should have cut down on the shooting and booming things to Hell, but thats him. being a Chinatown Yakuza influencial, his style of ""action"" took over the orginality and essence of Mission:Impossible. His direction towards Tom Cruise to have him do Kartae and such, really was disgusting and i think should have been deleted for completely obvious reasons. (email me if you want to know them) Having seen the old B&W samurai battle films made in Japan during and after the war, I can tell you, Woo ripped off th endings of them. The duels between the good and bad guys on the beaches, PLUS having the ""Karate"" of some sort stuck in there. he also took the same music from Gladiator to express humanism, which obviously DID NOT WORK. The parts that I did like though, were the spy tactics Cruise used to infiltrate the building and the technology used throughout the film. The car chase scenes really did not work out for me at all. The cast was fine, nothing wrong there. Dialouge was fine, setting was really cool, that I liked--Australia! And where  the crap did those guards come out of in the building scene? I really thought this film was a waste of my time and money. I do not recommend it to anyone interested.",Mission - Impossible II
731,Uncle A,Impossible not to enjoy,7,2 June 2000,"As a Tom Cruise vehicle, this is as good as it gets. As a John Woo flick, this is his best work since leaving the low-budget confines of Hong Kong. A lot of hard work has left Tom a lean, mean, fighting machine, and it shows with stunts and martial arts that we've never seen him perform before. The movie far exceeds its predecessor on the 'impossible' stakes and it is worth seeing for the final motor cycle chase alone. Thandie Newton is quite the sex kitten, and the only real complaint is that they didn't use Ving Rhames's considerable talent enough. Nevertheless, MI:2 is the best action flick you'll see all year: short on storyline, long on action - impossible to miss.Note: it also continues the long-standing tradition of when a movie is set in Australia, the Sydney Opera House must be shown as many times as possible. So it loses a mark for that.",Mission - Impossible II

Apart from from that tiny detail, the last half hour is the most brilliant piece of action I have ever seen.You will walk away forgetting about the unoriginal plot, or the repetitive Matrix-style slow-motion footage, and head-banging to the tunes of Limp Bizkit and Mettalica. The music is definitely this movies saving grace, and I recommend the soundtrack. But then there's the last half hour...In this compelling chase/beat 'em up sequence, you see a flurry of jaw-dropping gun fights (It's a John Woo movie of course it'd have gun fights!) and motorbikes.

733,osleraar,What a waste of my time.,1,21 July 2000,"This movie was so terrible, I only stayed to watch it because I needed to ride home with the other people I was with.  I must say that the scene in the beginning was enough to make my palms sweat while sitting there. Since I am an avid rock climber, I could relate to the situation well.  However, the scene was ruined when he made the impossible jump from ledge to ledge. Unless Ethan has gecko hands, he would never have held on.  This was prelude to the rest of the movie where I saw uncountable numbers of COMPLETELY unrealistic things happening.  ranging from technical impossibilities to the the laws of physics being beligerantly ignored.  If a movie is going to capture an audience it has to make the image that it COULD happen, and this was not the case with MI2.I managed to entertain myself with trying to figure out how short the movie would have been if John Woo made the action scenes real-time.  After about 15 minutes it got to be just unbearable to watch more of the slow motion that had no purpose.  Shots that really had no dramatic effect were slowed to the typical Woo speed.  I saw many scenes that would have been really cool, and adrenaline pumpers if they had been left at full speed.Besides all of the bad directing, and absense of any physical laws, the plot was unimaginitive, and boring.  The characters were not properly developed. The whole movie was depending on the action scenes, which frankly, made me want to wretch.",Mission - Impossible II
734,Jim West-3,Give it a second chance!,8,8 December 2000,"Ok, I agree this film is in no way perfect. Saying that, it is a great action film. What else would you expect from John Woo? I found certain things in this film to be unnecessary. The slow moving shots in Spain, while the chemistry between Cruise and Newton was being set alight for example. There was no need at all for the (what I found annoying) black dress, sweeping across the screen! I also saw no need for the constant use of white doves in the latter half of the film. I understand what they were there to represent, but they (like the dress) became increasingly annoying.On a positive note, the opening to the film, in the Australian outback was fantastic. And, after watching the ""making of"" documentary on the DVD, I am even more impressed. I don't think I ever truly believed that Action Man Tom actually did most of those stunts himself! The best part of the film is in the Chimera Lab. The tension, action and especially the score come together to make that a great scene. I think that it is worth watching the film just for that few minutes.I do think that casting Dougray Scott as the villain was a bad idea. He doesn't seem to quite give his character enough menace. One thing that we can thank Paramount for, in regards to casting him, is, that he was unable to play Wolverine in X-Men due to the over run shooting schedule. Thank God!All I can say is, try and give M;I-2 a second chance. It really isn't as bad a film as everyone first thinks. Yes, it has its faults. But don't ALL films? I think that it is an enjoyable action film, but it just doesn't come close to being as good as the first Mission Impossible.",Mission - Impossible II

737,achimwilde,No surprises,2,5 November 2001,"<<< May contain spoilers >>>I expected nothing of what I expect from a good movie, like a story or believable characters. The hype around this movie was overwhelming, and all you saw in previews was split-second long bits of action sequences.I didn´t know a thing about the story, and hey, why should they have told me of it anyway? The virus story was just a way to connect the cheesy action and to bore me to death. I usually don´t foresee even obvious twists in the story, but when there was only one injection left, I knew some good guy would be infected and the next step would be to get the antidote. I don´t mind plotholes (Matrix was full of them and I still loved it), if the rest makes up for it. I never saw the old series, but I saw the first Mission Impossible movie, and that one had a story. It was clever and confusing, which made it interesting. MI2´s story was just dumb, pointless and boring.Same thing applies to the characters. Cruise is Cruise, all right. But did he really HAVE to pretend he was James Bond? The chick was just a chick falling in everlasting love with Cruise in no more than a second, the ""team"" could have been played by the computer and the bad guy, he just sucked, he had no charisma.Last thing, the action. I believe that action itself is boring, unless it is really impressive and shows you something you haven´t seen a hundred times before. I liked the scene in the first movie where Cruise was hanging from the ceiling, not being allowed to touch the ground. It was so quiet in the theater, you could hear the people breathing. In MI2, there was just the fast-and-loud action that doesn´t allow any details. And the guy-and-chick-car-chase-on-mountain scene, tell me in how many James Bond movies we saw that before. *yawn*2/10, for the car exploding on the bridge and the girl´s t-shirt.",Mission - Impossible II
738,rodrigocpfranca,A good spy movie movie but a bit too excessive,6,14 September 2019,"In my opinion this movie has a foot of in relation to the other movies of the franchise. I think is still a great movie, it has somethings that both mission impossible and 007's franchise values like beautiful women, expensive cars and car chases... and it has a protagonist that is both a hero and a man's role model. But in this movie, ethan hunt is painted too perfectly, always being portrayed like the most awesome man that has all the qualities and absolutely no defects. The character is too exaggerated, as it also is the soundtrack and the camera effects and the drama inside the movie. At least they talk the same language. The storie is good, even being dated nowadays, but some parts of it happens very fast.

The only problem is that M:I 2 is a sequel to Mission:Impossible.If you have seen M:I you can predict every plot twist (the mask tricks, for instance, or the descent into the Biocyte shaft) so there's not real suspense in it.Vote: 7 out of 10 stars.",Mission - Impossible II

John Woo destroys the slow moving sequences of the first film and turns it into an all-out spectacular of explosions, gymnastics and stunts.The plot retains some of the confusing twists that the first one had so many of, but overall theres not much to think about... its just good eye candy, if you want an action extravaganza then this is your film.

The only bright note here is a cameo by Anthony Hopkins, who in reference to Ms. Newton's need for training, has the best line in the film.While one may wonder why actors of the calibre of Hopkins, Derek Jacobi and Judi Dench appear in such trash, presumably it is for the same reason that this vacuous socky-choppy flick was made - money, money, money!",Mission - Impossible II

I'd just like to add a couple of comments about the direction of John Woo, who is of course chiefly responsible for this unfortunate mess. Hope you're listening Mr Woo...a) People's hair blowing in the wind is at best a mildly diverting spectacle, not the basis for the plot of an entire movie. Or indeed an entire career.b) The slow-motion button should only be pressed in an emergency. If you carry on pressing it every thirty seconds it's gonna break. Or someone's gonna break your finger.c) About the bird thing. We get it already. Knock it off.d) All those close-ups of buff guys dressed in black fighting.

It has many flaws and my disapointment was not because I was comparing it to Woo's past glories, i find i can enjoy even the most mediocre Hollywood thriller as long as it has some pointless violence in it. But MI2 made some unforgivable mistakes:(1) You have to wait AGES for any action, the first real gun scene is in that vault place, and that isn't even that great. The mountain bit and the car bit don't count as they are a)boring and b)don't feature any guns. (2) It was Tom Cruise's show, nothing else (plot, the bad guy, suspense) seemed to matter  (3) It was not cool. There was no style  (4) There was nothing original in it, and the plot devise of wearing the masks is overused and trite.  (5) There were about 4 deaths.

746,ferencegrizzal,Don't Get The Hate (spoilers),10,28 November 2020,"This is hands down my FAVORITE installment in the entire series. WHY!?! WHY?? You may ask. Don't worry friends. Come along with me and pause your hate for a quick read and I'll tell you why.This movie is edited perfectly. It makes you feel good. Ever see Hot Fuzz? The music and visuals come together in such a way that the atmosphere and mood make the movie. Ride this flick with your heart on your sleeve. Also, it was released in the post-Matrix world of cinema. The slo-mo still feels fresh for the release date and gives the audience more of what they wanted to see in the movies.The seclusion to one location (Australia) for the duration of the film is unique for this, and all, installments. This was before the IMF had to globe-trot against shadow agencies and sought out evil masterminds like MI:3-6 or Craig's 007s. It's not a sequel storyline as much as just the next mission.Why was Goldeneye so great? I'll tell you. Bond wasn't going against some hidden mastermind villain. He was going against his own, 006. Ethan is in the same situation. Fighting one of his own, who knows his every move.Love at first sight. Another unique characteristic for this installment. Now before you start going off about his wife from MI:3; who has somehow managed to stick around, restrain yourself. Clearly she was his cover. We all know he had the hots for dumbdumb who got her brain popped on the helicopter. So know, the fact that you jumped to that defense is exactly why you don't like this film.One movie, one director, one concept, one mission.Sadly this is the last installment that utilized Masks as means of deception both to characters and the audience. I never wanted to see how they actually made the Masks, I just wanted to be surprised when they took them off.And to circle back around to the perfect film edits that make you have the feels, try and think back on these two perfect parts. One: Ambrose realizes he's killed his number 2 and the dramatic music swells until it crescendos right as Ethan rips off his mask and the Mission Impossible theme comes right in.Two: When Ethan pops the front wheelie and spins around pulling his handgun to shoot the car full of henchmen. The beat that the gunshots and bullet hits make while he's aiming for the gas tank has such a specific beat that you know it was conjured up in the editing room to make you feel good. And it does.If you don't agree with any of this at least give me this...the doves actually work for their scenes :)10/10",Mission - Impossible II

Sure the story is weak and the acting is poor, but that's not what this movie is about.  MI 1 was too confusing (especially to those of us who never saw the show) MI2 was great though.  It was chock full of action. And the way it was presented is so cinematic.  It's best seen in the theaters, or at least on a good home theater.  Tom Cruise makes a great action hero.  The fact that the characters are two dimensional actually adds to it- It makes the action scenes slicker.

I am 99% sure that this is not what happened with this one. I am positive that even if I was not anxious to watch it I would still hate it. I enjoy watching action films but this experience was beyond any imagination. The fact is that they made it so unreal that instead of being anxious and excited this movie made you laugh.And not just me, trust me! Anyway I gave it a 3. Not only cause it was hard to concentrate on it but also because it was predictable, boring and too hard to believe as much as I would like to.

The only time I saw it was when I was younger and was interested recently in why people seemed to hate it. Of course I was young then and thought everything was cool. About an hour into the movie I wanted to fall asleep. I realized suddenly that I wasn't watching a Mission Impossible movie.I was watching James Bond.Tom Cruise's sleek hair is even so Bond-ish. First he goes off on a mission, which isn't even fully explained other than ""Oh, yeah, go get this girl and recruit her,"" and for the first hour or so Tom is flirting around with this Spanish chick. This isn't Mission Impossible at all.The opening missions were always set and clear. A complex plot right away. And then there's the lack of continuity from DePalma's movie. I HATE lack of continuity. Isn't Ethan technically the chief now of the IMF force since Phelps is dead? The slow motion scenes were too dramatic for this. No intense love was built up. I will give it credit for classic facemaker moments and action, but this is like Matrix mixed with James Bond. The IMF team is pretty weak in this installment. It focuses more on Ethan kicking ass and blowing stuff up rather than have the team work as a whole, putting them on the side for comic relief. The whole ""hero and villain"" metaphor throughout the movie was getting pretty annoying too, and didn't fit in with a spy movie. So here's my break downPros -Cool action sequences -Classic facemaker momentsCons -James Bond appeal -No build up to actually feel drama -Poor plot for the mission -Poor IMF team, so not as much fun",Mission - Impossible II

There's also a semi-exciting car chase between Tome Cruise and the female lead co-star (forgot her name, sorry!) Their is a definite chemistry between the two and they seem to flow well together which does help keep the movie from being dull.So, if you're debating on whether or not to see part two because you were disappointed by the first one, check it out anyways because I don't think you'll be disappointed.",Mission - Impossible II

Just wanted to keep you safe!"" Like girl. Would it have been THAT hard to have given her a better reason to do that. Could have been ""now they can't kill me"". ""Now they can't weaponize it as easily."" Even ""buying us a little time"" would have been lightyears better than literally claiming she wasn't thinking and did it all for Ethan. Whom, by the way, she has spent... one night with???Once I got 55 minutes in and hadn't seen a single spy/action scene, I realized this was going to be a rough ride. There's nothing ""Mission Impossible"" about this story, it's basically: Ethan has a crush on this woman after she 'accidentally' straddles him like five separate times in one day for no reason--watch him stroke her face and be obsessed with her while some virus plot happens vaguely in the background.Having NO WOMAN in the movie would have been a more enjoyable film for me than watching this woman get passed around between Ethan and her ex and do nothing and have zero character. She's a MASTER THIEF. JUST LET HER BE AN EQUAL PART OF THE TEAM OR SOMETHING USEFUL.Anyway. I like mission impossible but this movie feels like a fluke or something.

754,apetrov,ACTION in capital letters - sets the standard how action movies should be made,9,3 May 2006,"I am movie junkie and appreciate all genres. However, when I go and see one I want to see what I expect - the best of that genre or simply the director and cast pushing the envelope to the limit. This one is so close to being the best action feature I have ever seen I hesitated giving it a clear 10. It has everything: proper plot - world threatening danger, car/bike chasing, great fight scenes (slowed down in short intervals so one can really enjoy the choreography), hi-tech gadgets, love worth risking your life, perfectly composed and aligned music scores and final showdown between the hero and villain. The last is very characteristic for John Woo and is one of his best trademarks (see Hart Target, Face Off, Paycheck). Certain scenes, where music and heart-beats substitute words and sound effects, are simply perfect and unsurpassed for an action movie. As for the actors, the cast is right on the spot, Tom Cruise is at its best, and Thandie Newton is so natural and has such realistic appeal she is surreal. Even the dialogs are never over the top. The rest of the cast - Sir Anthony Hopkins,Ving Rahmes and Dougray Scott with his Scottish accent as the villain - fits perfectly in the whole setting and have strong presence (even with limited appearance - Hopkins). Finally, if you expect a realistic story or a soft action/thriller like the first part you won't be amazed, but if you can really appreciate adrenaline packed action movie at its best go see it at once, or even better get your own DVD copy, you won't regret it.",Mission - Impossible II

It did have serious moments, but it was much more light hearted than the first and I guess that is what ruined it for me. It is worth watching and still somewhat enjoyable, but done in a different style than the first. Not a terrible movie, but it lost what was most desirable to me about the first one, which was the serious tone throughout the whole movie.

757,SmoothCriminal8291958,Just As Good As The First For Entirely Different Reasons.,10,10 April 2006,"""Mission: Impossible II"" is the polar opposite and entirely different animal of its 1996 predecessor. The production team of Tom Cruise/ Paula Wagner wanted to take the billion-dollar film franchise in a different direction. They wanted to correct the misalignments of the first film. Although likable, many people criticized the first film of being overly complex and confusing. So, the production team compensated by hiring a foreign action director from Hong Kong in John Woo to take the series in a new direction and to chart into a new frontier. They dump one of the two screenwriters, David Koepp, and keep the other Academy-Award winning one, Robert Towne, to helm the script. The result is an action film released in 2000 that grossed more than its predecessor. The first film was overly complex; its sequel is overly simple. The first film relied on intrigue, mystery, and CGI enhanced effects to deliver the goods, while its sequel utilized action/adventure and death-defying stunts instead to remain as equal as its predecessor. Instead of bashing ""M: I-II,"" instead I ask that everybody keeps an open mind and take a look at the grand scheme of things regarding the two films.What I like in particular is the fact that the two movies serve as complete opposites. Tom Cruise did not want to serve up the same movie twice, so he created an entirely different one, even if it does not confine to the original framework of its predecessor and TV series.""Mission: Impossible II"" is a seriously underrated film, although it does not confine to the original concept of the 1966 television series, or its film predecessor four years previous, Cruise still nonetheless should have garnered his fourth Academy Award nomination. I'm now going to make the stretch in stating if indeed, Cruise received a nomination for this role, he probably would have beat out favorite Russell Crowe for ""Gladiator."" He had to deal with emotionally, complex material from a incredibly underrated script by Robert Towne, who won an Academy Award for the ""Best Original Screenplay"" in 1975 for his script to the Jack Nicholson film, ""Chinatown."" Just because ""Mission: Impossible II"" is an action movie, does not automatically necessarily mean it's a bad film. You cannot dismiss it so easily, because it's like what Towne said so accurately about the film-making style of director John Woo: ""It's like Yeats, the famous poet, said, 'a terrible beauty.'"" All of John Woo's films have a certain type of unrelenting violence, in a similar fashion that director Martin Scorsese has, in his films that the viewer cannot resist but to watch. Now granted, ""M I: II"" is not the perfect film, and it is not without flaws. The overkill use of John Woo's slow motion techniques can be sometimes ""lame,"" but ultimately Tom Cruise single-handedly elevates the status of the film.People need to stop bashing Tom Cruise. I'm not saying that he's the most perfect human being/actor in the world today of famous celebrities, but nonetheless, he still undeniably has tremendous talent. When you analyze the range of his films, the range of acting for this actor is incredible. For people to bash Cruise without prior establishment of any solid foundations, makes the accuser(s) seem completely idiotic. Cruise is the consummate actor. You don't have three Academy Award nominations for being a *beep* actor, and he potentially could have won all three awards if not for the performances of Daniel Day Lewis, ""My Left Foot,"" (1989), Geoffrey Rush for ""Shine,"" (1996) and in the supporting acting role for Michael Caine in ""The Cider House Rules"" (1999).There aren't a lot of actors who are willing to take the physical beatings, do all of their own stunts, and act with the conviction necessary to carry the entire weight of the success or failure of the film. If you don't believe take a look at the previous winners in the Academy Award category for this decade alone. Russell Crowe (2000), Denzel Washington (2001), Adrien Brody (2002), Sean Penn (2003), Jamie Foxx (2004), and Phillip Seymour Hoffman (2005). Now granted, all of these preceding actors are extremely talented actors and deserving of all the success that they have been fortunate to receive w/in the past years, but none of them go through the complicated, time-consuming process of truly delving into the characters portrayed in the films that Tom Cruise evidently has done so in the past. Don't believe me? Think I'm talking out of my ass? Then, analyze ""The Color of Money,"" (1986) ""Rain Man,"" (1988) ""Born on the Fourth of July,"" (1989) ""A Few Good Men"" (1992), ""The Firm,"" (1993) ""Interview With the Vampire"" (1994) ""Jerry Maguire,"" (1996) ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" (1999) ""Magnolia"" (1999) ""Vanilla Sky,"" (2001) ""Minority Report,"" (2002) ""The Last Samurai,"" (2003) or ""Collateral"" (2004). Every actor has their off days so forget ""Cocktail,"" (1988) ""Far and Away"" (1992). Here's an actor who held his own against fellow Hollywood Heavyweights in Paul Newman, Dustin Hoffman, Gene Hackman, Jack Nicholson, Brad Pitt, Cuba Gooding Jr., Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Max von Sydow, Ken Watanabe, and Jamie Foxx.To the people who say that Tom Cruise is a ""not-so-talented"" actor who steals roles from other talented actors, let me remind you that Cruise has used his business savvy and ambition to work with talented directors such as Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Stanley Kubrick, Ed Zwick, Sydney Pollack, Brian De Palma, John Woo, Tony Scott, Ridley Scott, Berry Levinson, Oliver Stone, Michael Mann, Cameron Crow, Rob Reiner, Paul Thomas Anderson, and Neil Jordan. You don't establish a track record like this for working with any of the preceding directors: Tom Cruise has worked with all of them. If Tom Cruise is such a bad actor, then why have his last seven consecutive films dating all the back to 1999, opened at number one at the box office in the United States (which is difficult, given the fact that box office numbers have recently slumped)?",Mission - Impossible II

Whereas the first film is about espionage and suspense, M:i-2 is all action... but that doesn't make it bad. In fact, it's quite outstanding.While I have my complaints (especailly Nyah\Thandie Newton, who I'm sorry to say I dislike the mere presence of and I believe was horribly miscast), M:i-2 is, quite clearly, very underrated. It's a highly entertaining film that'll keep you on the edge of your seat, and despite not being a huge fan of Woo's style, the action sequences in this movie are fantastic, as is Hans Zimmer's score for the film. It's very impressive - the stunts, the special effects, the action... especially when one takes into account that Tom Cruise did his own stunts for this movie, too, as usual.If you're a fan of the Mission: Impossible franchise, action films, John Woo, or Tom Cruise, or any combination of those, you should watch this film.

In that, I mean that it caused me to think that instead of watching Mission Impossible 2, I could have simply surrendered my nine bucks to the people down at the theatre.  Gone down to the local hardware store, purchased a screwdriver, stabbed myself in the eyeball a few dozen times and still would have the larger portion of two hours un-wasted with the same experience gained.In all truth, Mission Impossible 2 wasn't a `BAD' movie. It just failed to deliver what its name implied. I went to the theatre expecting to see at least a little, Mission Impossible. To my surprise, I got a cross between `James Bond', `Die Hard' and Tom Cruise's personal fantasy of himself. If the name `Mission Impossible' meant seventy or so shooting deaths, a super unrealistic motorcycle chase scene (in which the motorcycles used, magically changed from street, to off-road tires depending on the need), little to no intrigue, and a ninja `Power Rangers' type climax, then yes, Mission Impossible 2 was right on. I'd have to say the movie's only redeeming quality had to be Ving Rhames (who, by the way, was in the movie for a total of about 27 seconds).

We could see the John Woo signature all over the action scenes.  Some cascade where a little over done with some scene impossible to believe, even with an open mind.The music was well used in the movie. The tension of the situations was well rendered by it.

764,Andy-161,Mission Improbable 2 ****-,10,8 July 2000,"Actually I thought this was rather good,if a little (OK a lot) far fetched but very easy plot to follow almost dumbing down compared to MI1 which was more surreal and always required close attention. It is certainly more fun that MI1 and with more than a little American James Bond feel about it with the cars the girl & the gadgets. You can tell who jointly produced it because it certainly is a slick ""Cruise"" vehicle ensuring our Mr C looks extremely good indeed at every opportunity, ie like the improbable rockface scene & slow motion shot flamenco bar scene in Portugal (or was it Spain?) I believe he did most of the stunts of which there are many. The production and soundtrack is very good, however I would have thought the visible hydraulic ram mechanism used for rolling vehicles would be digitised out by now.There's a lot of shooting and MR C seems to be an amazing marksman considering the positions he gets into. It is an action (cliche) packed romp which needs to be seen on as big a screen as possible with as good a sound system as possible, If you like Mr Cruise (who seems to get better looking as he gets older, the swine) you'll love this, if you dont you'll probably still enjoy it. Dont look too deeply its not supposed to be Shakespeare although as usual I expect the stuffy intellectual types will give it a hard time, but I enjoyed it",Mission - Impossible II

This is no longer style--a trademark--it has become a gimmick.  When in doubt, spin.Doesn't matter if it's Travolta or Cruise, it's become predictable, just like the movie: when in doubt, peel a rubber face off to keep the plot going.Mission Impossible II loads up the gimmicks and plot devices and violence to deliver a superficial actioner.

766,AMintzer,"Action - yes, but NOT true to the Mission Impossible genre",4,30 May 2000,The original TV series (especially the early years) was dynamite.  For the most part the plots centered around completely covert actions where the public didn't even realize anything was going down.  This was an exciting action movie but my big objection was that about only one-third (at best) was true to the MI genre - and those parts were really terrific. I also have a big problem that there has been internal corruption in the MI force in both pictures.,Mission - Impossible II
767,gretchvg,pure adrenaline--with a plot,8,25 May 2000,"In making this film, director Woo has taken the intensity and exhilaration of the vault break-in sequence in the original M:I movie and expanded it over many of his scenes, making seeing M:I2 an energy rush for the audience. There is none of the tedious and hard-to-follow dialogue of the first movie, and the plot is structured to offer the kind of trickery and twists found in a good espionage story without being so darn confusing. Cruise is skillful in his action yet remarkably genuine in his dialogue and interactions with other characters. This is a pleasant surprise after his presentation of a more cerebral and serious Ethan Hunt in the first film. M:I2 moves quickly, and the fact that Cruise performed his own stunts adds an interesting dynamic to the action that puts viewers on the edge. Thandie Newton also serves as an ideal complement to Hunt's sensuous and sensitive side. She reveals his humanity in the face of peril as well as his will to take action, which ultimately makes Cruise's character more real and intriguing than in the original M:I.",Mission - Impossible II

I can't say it let me down, but I just didn't feel that I was watching a Mission:Impossible flick. The action sequences were terrific, Woo certainly did his job in that department. But, it seems that too much time was took working on the fx and not the story. The first film's plot was great, nice plot twists and it took a lot of thinking to understand it. This film's plot was nice, but I was expecting to have to think a lot more.  I kept thinking, when is someone you think is on our side going to reveal that he isn't, but it never happened.

They're the same every time.) and it was hopelessly unintelligent.  I expect far better out of anything that's going to claim the name Mission: Impossible.  The first one was a good film, this one was just shot after shot of Tom Cruise trying to look good and John Woo trying to use as much slow motion and two fisted shooting as possible. Why was it that every time Tom went after someone, there was this need for him to do a flip before kicking them?  I expected far better than this.",Mission - Impossible II
778,Manda-13,Scooby Doo revisited,2,30 May 2000,"I went into Mission Impossible 2 without too many expectations. I saw the first film and thoroughly enjoyed it. I figured I could expect much of the same from the sequel. Well, I was wrong...very wrong. I was at least expecting a plot, but, alas, there was none. The poor excuse for a plot is that there is an ""evil"" man ready to set a devastating disease loose on all mankind and Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), along with the requisite beautiful partner find the source of the disease and bring a living sample of it back to Anthony Hopkins (he is only in the movie for about 8 minutes total, so I don't remember his character's  name). I was turned off by the time the opening credits rolled. The film opens with a man speaking in an indistinguishable accent, so I had no idea what he was saying. But I had many opportunities to try to figure it out since they replayed the monologue 3 times throughout the run of the film (for no real reason). Then we are faced with a plane being hijacked, and then we zoom to Tom Cruise hanging from his fingertips off the egde of a cliff while the opening credits rolled. I truly believe the only real reason behind this movie is to make Tom Cruise look ""cool"". John Woo was certainly the right director to go to for this, since he is known for his use of slo-mo, and penchant for symbolism in his films. The only real reason to see MI2 is to see Tom Cruise. Period.MI2 is bound to disappoint many. It's not a real action film, because there is very little action, and it's not a drama, because the characters are not developed at all: Ethan Hunt=good, Sean Ambrose=bad, Nyah=sexy. That's another annoyance. Thandie Newton is a talented actress, but here, she is reduced to basically being a Bond girl, her estrogen used as a plot device. And, finally , speaking of plot devices, the overuse of the mask f/x is extremely tiring. Give us a break Mr. Woo! We all saw FaceOff, it's a cool effect the first 20 times we see it. After that, it's a ridiculous parody of itself, a la Scooby -Doo cartoons,  that insults the audience. At one crucial point in the movie, it's obvious to everyone that a mask is being worn by one of the characters because it had been used 7 times prior to that in the movie. Yet, we are supposed to be shocked by the ultimate revelation...sloppy filmmaking, to say the least. All in all, I gave MI2 a 2. It was silly, overwrought, and campy in it's own way. Go see it if you must (and I know most of you must), but take heed...you may have a hankering for Scooby snacks by the time you leave.",Mission - Impossible II

Didn't care.  All I know is that the world is safe once again thanks to Tom Cruise and his exploding Oakly shades. Extra: Cool soundtrack.

793,xistan,Best action movie ever made?,6,5 June 2000,"It was with great expectations I went to see MI2. Why? Because the first movie was a great disappointment and I really thought the new one would be something extraordinary. And it sure is.After a somewhat confusing start, the plot takes form, and it is quite easy to predict the story. But hey! We are talking about an action movie here. One that claims to be a Mission Impossible, and I have to agree with that. Most of the tricks and stunts are really impossible, but that is what makes the movie worth seeing. If you are looking for a great story, with logic and reality you should see something else. MI-2 is pure action all the way through, with a small touch of romance as is appropriate in a good action flick. A bit confusing sometimes, you don't always know if the guy you see on the screen really is who you think it is.The answer to my question is that it may not be the best action movie ever made (it has to compete with Face Off, The Rock and other masterpieces), but it is pretty close. Tom Cruise is not a very good action actor, but I think his effort in this movie is acceptable. What makes me give this flick a rather embarrassing 6, is a few flaws that could easily be avoided. Hey.. there is no way a SUV will out run an accelerating motor cycle. I don't care if the stunts are impossible in reality, as long as it fits in the story, but please!!Conclusion: If you like action flicks with cool special effects but don't care much about reality or the story line, this is a movie for you. It is entertaining to say the least!",Mission - Impossible II

Sydney has never looked better on film and not once was I offended by the portrayal of Australians like I often am in so many other films.Cruise was excellent in his return to the role of Ethan Hunt, in fact he improved on his first attempt. I preferred the sequel to the original which is very rare. He also managed to bring back some of that 'Top Gun' charm that made us all love him back in 1986. I haven't had the urge to gawk at Cruise since 'Cocktail'.John Polson was a familiar and welcome face to see on the big screen and along with Ving Rhames provided excellent comic value to an already exciting film.If you're not sure about seeing this film, I would certainly recommend it.

795,Antianara,"What Went Wrong, Woo?",6,10 June 2000,"The first half of Mission Impossible 2 was somewhat promising--an elegant thief and a handsome hero work together to prevent an impending viral debacle.  The movie, however, quickly decomposed into a senseless series of big explosions and flying objects.Woo is an exciting director, but the carelessness with which most of the action scenes were filmed/edited  was at first disappointing, and as the movie progressed, increasingly hilarious.  Bad guys fire  wildly into the air and then fall in seemingly-unrelated fits onto a spark-filled floor. There was even a point when I began to wonder if I should pretend that this was a movie about superheroes so that my overstimulated brain could make some sense of all the flying . . . .
Tom Cruise is too good-natured  to be a shallow-minded action hero (I just wanted to pinch his cheeks), Thandie Newton was beautiful and enjoyable, and the bad guy (Scott) was good.  The rest of the cast could have been replaced by motion-sensing worker drones without much affecting the substance (!) of the movie.

797,boo123,This movie should be reclassified as Action/Comedy,5,1 June 2000,"This movie tries to better the competition on every front. In doing so it spreads too thin and falls up short.Note to director and writer's for future reference.1. To really pull off truly incredible stunts a movie needs to have the fantasy elements of a film like 'The Matrix' in order to suspend the disbelief of the viewer.2. The hero of the plot needs to possess the roguish charm of a character like Pierce Brosnan's James Bond to attract the ladies at the drop of a hat. Women are attracted to good-looking bad boy heroes.Throughout this movie Cruise holds onto his good guy in Hollywood persona. John Woo should have talked his star in to taking some real risks with the character, other than the treacherous mountain shots, which, although real, we are informed, looked positively corny. (The audience was having a real good belly laugh, anyway).The plot was very thin, so thin that it looked merely like a vehicle on which to hang all the super action shots. Thus creating a tremendous sense of imbalance throughout the entire movie.Best bits - Even though they raise a few giggles - the Action scenes are very good, amazingly choreographed. John Woo fans will not be disappointed. The cinematography was excellent. The Spanish flamenco scene was one of the best in terms of beauty and visual tension.Ving Rhames and John Polson as the trusty sidekicks were great, and gave the film some much needed character. Thandie Newman was perfect and played her part well.Now, just before I go point number 3. For all US film companies, writers and directors. Go easy on creating ALL Australian characters as a potential Crocodile Dundee stereotype, unless you want the whole audience to class you as a bunch of dumb yanks.",Mission - Impossible II
798,Gigolo Joe de la Ghetto,Good movie but a bit of a letdown.,6,7 June 2000,"For those of us who really enjoy movies, most of you have heard of Mission Impossible 2. Besides X-Men this is the most hyped movie of the year. I myself being a big fan of the first film I was very excited for the second. Having seen the first trailer back in 1999 M.I2 became no. 2 movie to see (After Gladiator). Unfortunately it was a bit of a letdown.In short the plot concerns Tom Cruise's cool guy Ethan Hunt from the first M.I flick recovering a stolen virus that kills people very quickly. This virus is stolen by rogue IMF agent Sean Ambrose.This is an interesting idea and since its very much a supervirus only Ethan Hunt can recover it.The problem with this film is that everything in this film is under developed. In the first film Ethan wasn't a super-hero but, for some reason in this film he is. Luther from the first film is back except he just sits behind a computer. Sean Ambrose is a great villan but is denied enough screen time to develop. The best point of this movie is the relationship between Anthony Hopkins and Tom Cruise. Their is a certain amount of not trusting each other one can feel, but once again it's under developed. The other thing that bothered me is that Ethan took no time to figure out the villan's plan contrary to the first film where it took him the whole movie to figure things out.The good points of this movie is that as normal Tom Cruise is dead on in his performance as is Dougray Scott. The action is great but contrary to what most people are expecting this movie has only 2 big action moments (Both of which rock :). This is a spy movie which is good and keeps this film from becoming a generic boring action flick.I have to say that so far so good for the Mission Impossible series. Keep things up and it could be bigger than Bond.***½ out of *****",Mission - Impossible II
799,afuller,So terrible it's hilarious....,1,25 May 2000,"SPOILERS FOLLOW! I like escapism as much as the next guy, but not when it's this mindless and melodramatic. I really don't know where to begin with this film other than mentioning that I should've believed the early reviews I'd seen and waited for word of mouth from my friends rather than rushing right out to see this film opening night. I should also note that I was in a packed 300 seat theater, and the majority of the filmgoers there were in stitches for one reason or another. All of the laughter that was generated was probably unintentional on the part of the filmmakers. I suppose I will start with the plot which we found to be utterly linear and predictable. Anyone looking for a convoluted yarn in the vein of the first movie will be sorely disappointed. It is also full of huge holes, like the fact that Luther claimed to hack into NATO GHOSTCOM in the first film. In this one, he can't even disable a simple alarm in a commercial corporation's security system. Maybe his skills got rusty because he partied too much between films. Since the good guys locate the bad guys in the first half hour, it becomes glaringly obvious that they could be wiped out by SAS, SEALs, Delta Force, etc. about halfway through the film. The crowd at my theater repeatedly burst into laughter at dialogue which was entirely inappropriate for the situation depicted onscreen. None of the characters were very memorable or engaging, except Ving Rhames' part. Dougray Scott was more an annoying wuss than anything else. Maybe he'll be better as Logan in X-Men. Thandie Newton looked cute, but that's about all she contributed. Woo's direction of this film is really tedious. There is an utter lack of tension except for the closing minutes, and even during that part some goofy cuts are made. Most annoying are the repeated slow pans and zooms that are supposed to show us the characters are so cool and dangerous it hurts. This is tough to buy when they're ambling along the street or a dock. Woo's dove fetish also got a lot of laughs during the closing minutes of the film. Tom Cruise also landed many chuckles with his martial arts talents. Yes he looked fairly credible, but an agent in such situations would be more concerned with killing efficiently rather than gracefully. Also note that the chase scenes in the movies are real snoozers, nowhere in the league of say, ""Bullitt"". I still can't get over the tedium of the final chase scene. In real life, the Triumph bikes used in the film would walk away from the SUVs and sedans in pursuit. My final beef is with the score. Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard also scored ""Gladiator"", and he was prevented from attending the premiere of that film because he had to work on this film's score. I can tell you right now, one of them was absolutely smashing and functioned brilliantly and it certainly wasn't this one. Zimmer is all over the place here seems to reference all the boring parts of his past works. Lisa Gerrard's stylings added a nice sense of humanity and gravitas to Gladiator but here they combine with the overly melodramatic visuals to descend into the realm of pure cheese. Unless you're really eager to waste $8 and 123 minutes of your life, I'd advise waiting to see this hits your local Blockbuster...",Mission - Impossible II

801,ixltoo,Warmed over Woo fails to escalate a very buff Tom above typical action movie plotting and execution.,1,24 May 2000,"I thought the first Mission Impossible movie was awful -- this was an improvement but only marginally so.  The movie starts well, with Cruise tredding on James Bond territory but as the movie wears on the somewhat interesting plot gets disposed of in  favor of typical action movie cliche. Instead of building suspense we get no less than 4 ""countdown clock"" sequences.  The  supporting cast is wasted in this Cruise vanity project -- they barely contribute to the mission at all.  Woo doesn't really attempt anything new here -- it's been a bit of deja vu with him since the fabulous ""Killers"".  My real complaint is for the use of the computer graphic ""masks"" that play a prominent part in the plot.  It's a far too convenient plot mechanism designed to move the story forward -- and very arbitrarily at that.

Brian DePalma, not anywhere to be found on my favorite director's list, really did a top-notch job with the first movie...if people complained that the first movie was too hard to understand, they will be pleased to know that the second movie throws not only logic out the window, but also any sense of adventure, suspense or fun...it's a big disappointment...i can't think of anything else to say because i am still dumbfounded by how LAME this movie is.  I like Tom Cruise, I just don't like John Woo (at least in America). Go rent Mission Impossible, and while your at it, see if you can find Woo's Asian films, like Killer.",Mission - Impossible II
803,surfsider,Mission: Implausible,2,29 May 2000,"OK...Like everyone else, when I saw ads for this film I got excited. The first Mission film was really well done, with DePalma recreating the stealthy spy type feel of the series. There will not be a better nail-biter than the highwire segment in the first.When I saw that John Woo was going to direct #2, I was psyched! I had visions of Faceoff dancing through my head, eager to see two hours of hard-core, non-stop action. Here's where you should take heed. The action scenes are few and far between and most of the stuff they do seems like deja vu from dozens of older films. The first Mission, cited as ""too complicated"", made the writers come up with a cliche and grade school simple storyline of an agent gone bad [how many times have we seen this?]whose only schtick is a Scottish accent, who plans on wiping out the world with a virus.It took a good hour before any real action hit the screen, and most of it was like a rehash of Faceoff. Anthony Hopkins was HORRENDOUSLY under-used, and Ving Rhames, who is a terrific actor, gets stuck sitting in a van the whole film, mashing away on a keyboard.The implausability factor is from Cruise though. In the first film, he was a clean-cut, by the book agent with a nice mix of daredevil and intelligence. In this one, he is a mix of Shaggy from Scooby-Doo and some horrible Van Damme wanna-be. Part of what made this film ridiculous was Cruise suddenly bouncing around like a kung-fu master!? The one scene where I laughed out loud was the start of the bike chase. After dispatching a bunch of guys, he runs over to a bike and then STOPS AND PUTS ON HIS SUNGLASSES!?!? How STUPID is that!?All in all, if you want to see this film, watch the trailer. All the action is shown there. If you really want to fork out $5 and sit through 2 hours of this drivel, just don't say I didn't warn you.

Not that I expect an action movie to have a lot of substance, but John Woo sacrificed plot and believability for as many explosions, fight scenes and car chases as I have ever seen in one film. I felt insulted as an audience member that I was expected to believe that the two main characters were in love within 30 seconds (of film time) of meeting one another, that someone could escape a bomb within 2 seconds of it going off without a scratch, and that after colliding mid-air with someone at a combined speed of about 200 km/hr and falling 40 feet off a cliff, Tom Cruise could walk away unscathed. Should Mr. Woo have paid a bit more attention to these sorts of indiscrepancies, the movie would have been much more enjoyable. I'm just glad I didn't have to pay for it!",Mission - Impossible II

The flaw was that some of the scenes were very lame. I'm not gonna spoil the lame scenes but beware: slow-motion + normal day gestures = LAMENESS. On the bright side, the movie was breath taking. Every minute was full of intense action and clever thinking. When I say clever thinking I mean some of the clever stuff Ethan Hunt does when in danger (Ethan Hunt is the main character). When I was back at my house after the movie, I spent an hour trying to copy some of Cruise's phenomonal gun tricks. So overall, see the movie. You should love it!",Mission - Impossible II

Hey,what do you expect - Pinter?   The hokey plot borrows from any Bond movie - pick one at random - and this spy-turned-traitor business is getting real tired.   However, some of the action sequences are eyecatchingly staged even when the fight scenes drag on ad nauseam, and if John Woo's trademark balletic slo-mo shoot-outs are getting a little tiresome, well there's always Limp Bizkit on the soundtrack.",Mission - Impossible II
814,sexyrob96,Hey! Don't knock it!,9,3 October 2000,"Ok, this is not an intelligent triller. It is different from the first. John Woo and Sir Tom Cruise opt of the more 'violent' approach. With amazing affect. MIF Man, Hunt is out again, with longer hair and a more muscles, to stop a virus. Dougray Scott is the baddie. And thats simply it! I admit this is a silly daft film. But who cares. Calling it daft does not mean its bad. This is no way a bad film. The visuals are great. John Woo is a god when it comes to action, as with Hard Target and Face/Off. The scenes of Cruise on 'holiday' scaling a mountain is breathless. The end shoot-outs, bike chase and final show down are also fantastic. And when Tom Cruise kicks the gun up...... amazing. Its a daft plot, but look at it as a panto. Like with Gone In 60 Seconds. Its a film to unwind to. You don't need a brain. You will not be a disappointed.If you liked the Matrix this will also appeal to you. Black leather, lots of guns and some great martial arts done in 'slo-mo' style.

It just doesn't get much better than this. While the story and characters were kind of flat, the action was anything but. And isn't that what's most important in an ""action"" movie? You have to give Woo credit for taking an average summer blockbuster and turning it in to something really great.Sure some of the stunts were somewhat unrealistic, but what did you expect? Woo gave the action scenes his own touch, so that crashes and explosions you've seen before look like something new.A lot of people instantly classified this movie as a stupid action flick, and did not give it the chance it deserves.

Watch the way Woo does it! Of course there were cliche's but look at how he exaggerated them. I was sitting in the cinema with a huge smile on my face. Just watch the little things carefully. Look at the little symbolic points, e.g. the white dove that is flying into the room through before Tom Cruise walks in. And later on the dove is sitting next to him on a bar. But more exciting than this, the scene with the motorcycle is unbelievable good. Of course it is an cliche and of course it is inhuman what he does, but Woo knows that too. But the good thing is that Woo let's you see that he knows. Just those scenes and symbolics are making this movie worth to watch.

Not every movie need to have a great storyline. The acting of this movie is very good, especially Tom Cruise and Ving Rhames (who always acts great in movies) Thandie Newton is a beautiful girl who also plays in it.Some actionsscenes are superb, think about the racescene between Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton). Really good scene and nice filmed. Think about the latest actionscene, on the beach. A little bit Matrix-style ( i liked that)Mission Impossible 2 is very different if you compare it with the first one.

The beautiful action sequences and dramatic sequences make this movie an absolute pleasure to watch.  The writing, which is done by Robert Townsend who did Chinatown, is absolutely flawless.  Tom Cruise does an amazing job at portraying who Ethan Hunt is.  It is flawlessy real and absolutely convincing.  For all who thought this movie was bad, YOU DID NOT GET IT!!!

823,VagueVoice,Good action film!,7,8 April 2008,"I remember going go the cinema to watch MI2 and being quite pleasantly surprised! I was younger at the time, being maybe 16/17 and my desire for an intellectual driven plot was not particularly well formed as yet. But I think this was the film that made the transition for me, having a good story which was reasonably straightforward to understand and breathtaking action sequences (at the time) with 3 good actors that worked really well together.I've noticed that many of the comments here for this film are pretty negative, and, I suppose, can understand why. In retrospect it is just your typical Hollywood, big-budget movie attempting to cash-in on an already successful franchise, but at the the same time, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. If it was a bad movie then obviously I'd think differently, but it's not at all! The cinematography in this movie is very well put together and the soundtrack score works really well also. In effect this all adds to a really good sense of atmosphere, portraying the classic good (Hunt) and evil (Ambrose). This is all held together by Nyah Nordoff Hall (Thandie Newton), an ex-girlfriend of Ambrose's and a new love interest for Hunt, which I'd say holds up pretty well. The action sequences are well put together, from the scenes in Utah with Cruise free-climbing a Mesa, the Biocyte skyscraper scene, to the Bare island scene..all well done I think.Overall MI2 is an easy watching movie. If your going to take it seriously as a film then your going to be disappointed but if you like your action movies and Tom Cruise then you'll enjoy it. First film is better but it works well as a new genre to the Mission Impossible series.",Mission - Impossible II

The original Mission: Impossible was a great action flick that actually made me think. This movie unfortunately took everything I loved about the first one and tossed it out the window. Gone is the semi-cohesive plot that gets your brain working. It's replaced with one of the most by the numbers, boring, script I've ever seen put to the screen. Woo's direction is typical of him, with a lot of slo-mo shots and ridiculous shootouts. There are some decent looking action scenes, including a well done motorcycle chase scene, although it is completely ruined by the scenes end. My biggest problem with this film is the complete shift in tone. Ethan Hunt is made to look more like a James Bond character and less like himself. It is very clear that this film was the only one that was this way because by the time Abrams took over for M:I3, we were back to the same old Ethan. All in all, this film is a failed attempt to make the Mission: Impossible series ""cool"", when in fact, it was ""cool"" all along.",Mission - Impossible II

The only thing that kept me awake during the film was a snoring noise coming from the seat in front of me. John Woo added the special effects which took the attention away from the ""story"", if there was one. Tom Cruise arrogantly pleased the ladies with his daring mean feats and overcoming all the odds with his self-gratifying overacting. The plot was 100% predictable and utterly boring.

It's just such a cool, fun flippin' movie to watch. I remember seeing it back in the day in a big Pasadena theatre with twenty or so of my off the wall friends and afterwards, heading back to my house and trying to fly over my couch with plastic pistols (breaking them and the sofa in the process) and also went through the long-haired, Tom Cruise look for awhile.

All this movie is action and no substance, the first Mission Impossible was good, with a great plot and a nice twist at the end. This movie is all about seeing how many explosions could be used in a high budget film. The stunts are totally ridiculous and illogical. Like all of John Woo movies this is a over funded pile of explosions, bad wire tricks, and improbable events.

One of the things that I have grown to hate over the years is fights that go on forever with each combatant getting in many blows that would be lethal in real life, but only slow down the participants in the movie -- often with silly slow motion that breaks out.  This formula worked very well for Wile E. and Road Runner as well as Adam West and Burt Ward, but just don't make it in a film supposedly aimed at persons with double digit ages.  This movie is so full of these scenes that seem to go on for 15 minutes that there is little time left for a real movie.The media often report on how much stars are paid to do a movie.

On that note, I'm going to hurl if I see another white dove in a film fly by in slow mo. Oh the symbolism....It goes without saying that this film has laughable writing and stunts that, while impressive,make you crack up at the absurdity of it all, rather than fill you with awe.I haven't even gotten to the fact that the relationship between Cruise and Newton develops much too quickly and unbelievably.

The action scenes are directly imported from The Matrix - but without the excitement of discovery they are tiring, repetitive and gratuitously violent. The fast-slow-fast rhythm of the movie is predictable and tiring. The way Thandie Newton minces all around is tiring. The Scottish accents are tiring.

This was no where near the level of the original MI. I was tempted to walk out on this one and I would say it's close to being in the same category as one of the worst movies I've seen right behind Congo. The plot in this movie was extremely thin and I felt at times like I was watching a model shoot or an advertisement for various products.

But wait!  There is a rogue agent who has stolen a deadly virus (is this The Rock?  Where's Nicolas Cage?  Did they get a deal on that island?)  Rogue agent demonstrates how neat rip away masks are (Hi, Scooby Doo Mysteries!).  MI: 1 is rehashed for about an hour.

In this movie, Ethan Hunt tries to stop the villain from releasing a deadly virus into the world, after that, there's really no plot.  The movie then goes head first into senseless violence and stupid stunts.  After a while you get tired of seeing people being beaten-up in slow-mo, and things blowing up.  This seems more like a run-of-the-mill Bond film.  John Woo might be good a just action, but when it comes to intelligent film making, he fails.

I went in expecting high-tech, breathtaking, and at least somewhat suspenseful spy scenes with the constant fear of Ethan getting caught hanging in the air; all I received was a trite, predictable plot with far too many people wearing the masks of their enemy.  I mean, the only thing this movie lacked was a guy wearing a mask of himself over his own face to try and fool the audience into thinking it was his enemy.

And even if Tom Cruise does a descent job, it's not Chow Yun Fat!Overall a good action movie, but the violence is too conventional.",Mission - Impossible II
847,bernie-38,What happened?,5,25 May 2000,"I love John Woo. The mastermind behind The Killer, Hard Boiled, Bullet in the Head, and even Face/Off has created a very exciting, visceral, tense action flick in MI2. But that's it.The action sequences are very cool and fun to watch, but they are all just typical ""Woo-isms"" we've seen before: the excessive slow-mo, the dive and shoot executed by Tom Cruise (and by Chow Yun-Fat millions of times before), the stunts and jumps that can only be explained by non-Newtonian physics, and of course the doves. When there is action, it is very fun.Everything else, i.e. the plot, was forgettable. Before I went to see MI2, I knew nothing about the story. After I saw it, I understand why: The plot was not worth talking about. Robert Towne wrote the screenplay (from the story by Brannon Braga and Ronald D Moore). He also wrote Chinatown which is a masterpiece in itself. How did Woo and Towne collaborate on such a piece of crunk?!?Trying not to spoil anything. The main storyline is Ethan Hunt (Cruise) has to figure why a former spy has defected. The side plot (or maybe this was supposed to be the main plot, I'm not really sure) is the blossoming relationship between Cruise and a professional thief played by Thandie Newton. One of the things that really spoiled this movie for me was the inappropriateness of this ""love story."" I have no problem with the existence of a love interest in an action movie, but it didn't work here. They focused on it too much, but then trivialize it at the same time. It had no meaning, it was just trying to put two attractive people together half-naked in bed. If they want to make the love story the main part of the movie, I needed more. I needed to know why they like each other beyond pure attraction. I want more cerebral dialogue between them. I want to know more. In Chinatown, I wanted to know more about Dunaway and Nicholson, and then the movie gave me what I needed. MI2 fails miserably. The rest of the plot is slightly familiar if you've seen Twelve Monkeys (sans time travel).And of course there's the acting. How can you go wrong with Anthony Hopkins, Ving Rhames, and Tom Cruise of a very impressive outing in Magnolia and a pretty good outing in Eyes Wide Shut. Hopkins is in it for an very unimpressive 2 or so minutes. Ving Rhames had some funny lines, but was also a non-factor. Cruise had his moments, but the rest was filled over-acting or non-acting. To Cruise's credit, he did do most of his own stunts a la Jackie Chan.A major disappointment I had was the target audience, or rather how they made the movie to target their audience. I hate this fact about 90% of studio movies anyway, but it was so blatant. The PG-13 rating so that kids can go see it without sneaking in. A Woo movie is supposed to be an R. Without the R, much of the violence loses it meaning. Watch Hard Boiled and The Killer, the violence in those two movies mean something, a certain poetry that many critics have accredited to Woo. Second, the inclusion of the love story seems to attempt to appeal to a larger female audience. And of course the fast cars, fast motorcycles, and fast draws of guns always draw the masses of men (18-49). Lastly, the fact that it is a summer movie. I'm sure if there was less pressure to open MI2 on Memorial Day (wednesday), there would be more time to make a better movie. Imagine if this was given three or four more months and opened in September. I have to wipe the tears from my eyes.All in all, MI2 is not worthy of its predecessor nor its legacy. Mission Impossible is a better movie even if the story is convuluted (it was still intriguing). Most of John Woo's previous movies are by far superior (although Hard Target is a glaring exception). Go to see MI2, it's a fun action movie with exciting stunts and special effects. Don't see it again because the plot is horrible and the love story inane.",Mission - Impossible II

The plot was at best poor and boring and most certainly predictable in most of its parts. The script suffered from all those elements for a successfull action movie, except some shots. It reminded me mostly of a love story with bad scripting. The dialogues were low and at times you could hardly hear what they were talking about. One good thing was the photography which was pretty extraordinary. In conclusion, the impossible mission is to be able to watch the movie...",Mission - Impossible II

Woo directs this film masterfully and Cruise excels (well somewhat, it just seemed a little weird watching him do cart wheel kicks) but so what, it was as far from being real as possible and thats why you gotta love it.  Its a movie to sit back and let dazzle your eyes with magnificent spectacle. The story ain't bad either and it will keep you satisfied. dont read the critics reviews, they're just synacle #%@holes anyhow.

852,Pmere,The silliest movie I've ever seen,3,5 June 2000,"Honestly, the entire time I was watching this movie all I could think was ""Dang, this is silly."" It was also highly predictable. I also didn't like how Cruise (in full bad-acting mode as always) slept with the girl within the first 15 minutes (don't be alarmed, I haven't given anything away). The fight scenes we also terribly long, there were also parts I knew for sure were supposed to be serious, dramatic, thought-provoking scenes but they came off as super funny. I also hated the over use of the masks, after a while I wanted to put one on myself and become deaf so I wouldn't have to hear the crap-tacular dialogue. There's also a scene that looks remarkably like the same as the first-Cruise suspended by a rope, stops just an inch and a half above a highly sensitive floor *woooohooo, it was boring*. There were some seriously good parts of the movie like, Dougray Scott's Ambrose, he was the best villain I've seen in a long time *and HOT too:)*, the slow-motion stuff was cool for a while and so was the car chase in the beginning, also excellent was the choice of location-Sydney, Australia ... it made for some nice scenic shots. In conclusion this movie is silly but worth seeing for the background and comedic effect of all the nonsense they didn't edit.",Mission - Impossible II
853,Redamedia,"Entirely too ""Woo-ified""",6,30 May 2000,"Mission Impossible II reeks of John Woo's overwrought style.  This is practically any John Woo movie ever made, just replace the faces.  Speaking of faces, if one more character pulled off a fake face, I think I might've spontaneously combusted.  The pace was pretty slow in several places, and the film didn't hold any surprises.  Without the slow-motion sequences, the movie would have clocked in at about a respectable 90 minutes.",Mission - Impossible II
854,seanmach,One of the worst Hollywood movies of the past decade.,2,31 May 2000,"This movie is awful in two major ways:  First, this is not a Mission Impossible film.  The gadgets, espionage, cunning, and suspense have been replaced by guns and fists.  Tom Cruise never fired a gun in the first Mission Impossible, and that's ALL he does for the last hour of this movie. Second, even though this is a John Woo film, its the worst Woo film I've ever seen.  The action sequences are well choreographed but the story is so stupid that Woo's graceful touches are just corny.  There is no suspense leading up to the action, it just starts, and when it does, its not very creative.  This is the second worst movie I've seen in recent memory, second only to The Haunting.",Mission - Impossible II
855,Wogboy,"A good action film, but not in line with original",7,25 March 2003,"I enjoyed this film as a plain old shoot-em-up sort of action film. However the original was very unique, in that it was very suspenseful and you were drawn into the story more because of the story-line.Unfortunately, what John Woo has done is, i guess, what he does best and that is make a old fashioned action film. I would have enjoyed this a lot more if it was called something different and not associated with the Mission Impossible franchise.In short, if you loved the first one, then you probably wont like this. However if you like your typical action film, then this is the one for you.",Mission - Impossible II
856,Revolution25,John Woo: action sequence genius,8,26 May 2000,"John Woo has made a terrific film with MI2. The action is an adrenaline-pumping, high octane thrill ride.  It's worth seeing just for the last fifteen minutes alone.  Woo choreographs his action sequences so that they have the fell of a finely tuned ballet of violence.  The man is the master of his genre.The film itself is also quite good.  Cruise does a wonderful job as Ethan Hunt and the girl is very good too.  The plot is quite obviously secondary to the masterful action of the film, but it holds together well on its own.If you suspend disbelief and go into this movie with an open mind, you are certainly in for a very fun ride.",Mission - Impossible II

What happens between the beginning and the end is very hard to predict, the ending, however is exactly what I expected (Just like in Face/Off).Overall it's worth the money you pay to see it, just don't believe the reviews in the newspapers which say it has no plot (in Australia anyway) because it has a great plot with plenty of twists and turns, and of course intense action. 9/10.",Mission - Impossible II

Cruise did many of his own stunts and they are impressive, but he learned a few moves which are fun to see at first, but they become over-used.  Ving Rhames is fun as always. The movie has some goofs such as the tires on the motorcycles changing during a chase scene, but all in all this is a typical mindless summer movie that just fun to watch.",Mission - Impossible II

The rest really sucked (I hope i can use this word)

Unfortunately what I saw was the most insipid, boring, predictable manure of a movie that amounted to a total waste of two full hours of my life.  Here's some points: The good:  1)Thandie Newton is hot The bad:  1) ""mask"" charade becomes extremely predictable as a remarkably stupid and convenient plot device 2) Thandie's ""thief"" character is dumb enough to continue her theft in the beginning of the movie despite the fact that some unknown man (Cruise) has stumbled upon her. 3) Sean, Thandie's ""ex"" and the idiotic bad guy in this movie, is dumb enough to tell his assistant that he doesn't care if Naya is spying on him as long as he gets some play.  He emphasizes this by chopping his assistant's fingertip. 4) A virus that ""incubates"" with ""direct sunlight""?? Anyone with any scientific knowledge at all will burst out laughing!! 5) Slow motions scenes were poorly fit in the context: for example they are appropriate at some tragic climax to a movie, not every two minutes. 6)  The longest fight scene i've ever scene between two wimps who you know couldn't kick a chicken's ass in real life. (Cruise and the villain). 7) Doves??  What the hell?  I think Woo had some left over from ""Face Off"" 8) the most poorly edited scene i've seen in a LONG time:  in the previously mentioned fight scene, the villain gets on top of Cruise with a dagger pointed one inch above his eye.  Cruise then grabs the villain's arm, then in the next shot we see that the knife is now 5-6 inches away from Cruise's eye, then the next shot it's cruise that is now inexplicably on top of the villain and then grabs the knife.What B.S.

However, with such a top-notch cast and crew M:I-2 promises much more than the average popcorn flick and, despite really wanting to love this film, I found it balancing on the verge of ludicrous and occasionally toppling over into full blown, unintentional comedy.The blame for this has to lie in two places. Firstly, with the writer/s, who appeared to have created a one hour script and decided to pad out the rest with gunfire and an incredibly protracted punch-up.  They also seemed to run out of dialogue for Thandie Newton after 20 minutes, and forced her to spend the rest of the film open-mouthed and struck dumb with either fear or admiration.Secondly, John Woo, love your stuff, but please NO MORE slo-mo, fluttering white doves, face-swapping or dual-handed diving shoot-outs. Looks good the first eighteen times, but then it just gets silly.Despite this, the film has a couple of great one-liners, solid performances all round, lots of star quality from the lovely Tom, and the rock climbing is almost worth the ticket price on its own.

Woo's trademark operatic visual style complements Cruise's harder edge. Cruises dead-on performance and Woo's eye for color, motion, and emotion give a thrilling snap to familiar formula.   Of course the script is loaded with physics-defying action sequences, but none of the moments of jarring stupidity that derailed MI-1.If you do not expect any great depth of thought, you will undoubtedly enjoy this kinetic eye candy.",Mission - Impossible II

Woo, who probably thinks that the original TV show and movie were bad, tries to make M: I something that it is not. Woo is simply a bad director, instead of dialog he uses explosions, instead of character development he uses car chases, etc. This film has absolutely nothing entertaining in it. Unless you like ultra un-realistic action that makes no sense you will not like this picture.The first film had intelligence in it, there was thought involved in the plot, and Ethan Hunt was actually a normal person, unlike M: I-2 where he is just a simple two dimensional figure with no personality. Tom Cruise, who is one of the producers, should have demanded to have Brian De Palma back, who actually knows a thing or two about story telling.The only other movie that is even close to the quality of this picture is Battlefield Earth, and I even liked that movie more because at least you could laugh at how pathetic John Travolta looks.",Mission - Impossible II

In 30 years of watching movies, I never, NEVER walked out of a theater...that is, until I went to see MI-2.MI-2 is, by far, the worst film ever made.  As soon as I saw ""Directed by John Woo"", I knew that I was in for something bad.  This movie is shockingly bad.  Woo cut his teeth in the Hong Kong Cinema making ultra-violent films like Hard Boiled and The Killer.  His films in Hong Kong and in America are riddled with ridiculous caricatures, cliche-ridden dialogue and mind-numbing camera tricks.  I believe he is in love with slow motion.  As a matter of fact, when I saw Woo's name in the credits, I decided to count the number of times he used slow motion...after all, the movie itself wouldn't be worth watching.  By the time I walked out (I COULDN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!!!), which was during the fight scene that seemed to last for about 45 minutes, I counted 48 different uses of slow motion.  Watch the cable run out of the winch...in slow motion!  Watch Tom Cruise walk...in slow motion!!  Watch the bad guys shoot a million rounds of ammo and hit nothing...in slow motion!!!The problem is that, because the movie has done so well at the box office, we're going to get years of this type of garbage.

I am an Aussie, I live in the Capital city of Australia, Canberra four hours outside of Sydney and I thought it was well shown, I recognised many locales.  The saddest thing in the movie is when the poor Holden Statesman gets hit by the truck.  But the movie did lose its Mission Impossible status.  Just like Bond, Hunt falls in love with a girl that plays an crucial role, and just like the Matrix there are some good fight scenes and slow-mo shots.  But the movie was so predictable you really only need to see the first 30 minutes and then you can walk out knowing everything that happened.  The part that I liked best though, there was no bad guy telling good guy his whole plan.  Once he catches what he thinks is Hunt, he shoots him.

Not only did the movie seem to drag on forever, but it actually managed to get much worse as it progressed. I noticed that the antagonist's Irish accent got much thicker as the movie went on.  And surprisingly, there weren't any nifty gadgets as there should be in a spy movie.

The original 'Mission: Impossible,' under the guidance of the action-inept Brian De Palma was mildly enjoyable, but left a funny aftertaste in the mouths of audiences. 'M:I-2' in comparison is no comparison. Hong Kong action director John Woo completely rescues the series like his name was Clark Kent. With his masterful control of the moment, and his flair for the semi-insane, he takes audiences on a two-hour joyride that they will never forget. Tom Cruise is awesome as always, reprising his role from the original as Ethan Hunt, an IM agent off to save the world, this time from a deadly virus by the name of Chimera. Dougray Scott plays a convincing villain by the name of Sean Ambrose, who hopes to hold the world ransom by releasing this virus and being the only one in the world with the cure. With unbelievable action scenes, great fight choreography, awesome special effects, and even an interesting plot, 'M:I-2' will rock you from start to finish. 'M:I-2' is truly the quintessential `blockbuster' of the summer.",Mission - Impossible II

A definite should see in my books.",Mission - Impossible II

Between MI2 and another weak Woo movie Face/Off, the Scooby Doo trademark ""perfect looking"" mask scenes are overdone to the point of sickness.  As in all Woo movies, (face/off, broken arrow), the plot is paper thin and completely predictable and the action scenes overdone.  The movie has no resemblance to the T.V. series. Although Mission Impossible I was a twisted mess, at least it had some sort of resemblance to the series. MI2 copies recent James Bond films instead. Pray John Woo doesn't get his hands on the 007 trademark, because I'd have to jump of a tall bridge.I must say I enjoyed the action scenes, but I was expecting more.

It is a mindless action movie, completely void of all that made Mission Impossible, both the first movie and the TV series, a superior movie and TV experience. John Woo has proved once again to be a very mildly talented director with only one thing in mind: how many bullets he can throw into a crappy movie. Rather than give people something new, Woo and Cruise have brought you a farce of an action movie. Granted, some of the action sequences are exciting at times, but I firmly believe that Mission Impossible should be about the story, and not about how many people Tom Cruise can kill. I recognize that I am looking at this from a perspective of what it should have been, and not what it is. It should have, could have been a much better movie.

Although he was directed to choose other team members, these members provided a minimal, negligible contribution and might as well have performed as taxi drivers.  All the 'important' and dramatic tasks fell to Cruise himself, while tasks a trained monkey could perform were given to everyone else.  Although the action sequences were frequent and Tom Cruise deserves kudos for performing many of the stunts himself, the movie was impossibly shallow and devoted purely to having him on center-screen for over two hours.  The only saving grace of the film was director John Wu's attempt to add a little artistic flair to the direction, but a painting made of dung is still dung.",Mission - Impossible II

Needless to say Thandie Newton is hot, and although she was the characteristic ""damsel in distress"" throughout the entire movie (save for her when you first see her) it was ok, b/c she is hot.

Great acting, phenomenal action, and tons of face-ripping, M:I 2 is a MSIT (Must-See-In-Theater) flick.Tom Cruise again does a great job as superspy Ethan Hunt, but this time has a much better script to work with.  His character seems more fleshed out and real than the short-haired spy-on-the-run we met in 1996.  While he and love interest Thandie Newton never quite click, he and supervillain Dougray Scott offset each perfectly (Dougray, I forgive you for abandoning X-men) and have some wonderful exchanges.  My only complaint is that the ending seemed a bit rushed.  The climax seems to just keep building and building and then the credits roll.  Oh well.Overall, ""Mission: Impossible 2"" provides a great time for all (all guys, at least) and is stuffed so many amazing moments, you'll wish the big screen had a rewind button.

What you'll find here is intense slow motion, the odd white dove and of course the most insane, double gun clutching, I'll-take-a-whole-army-of-you-lot action.

900,Buccaneer45,A must see,7,15 June 2000,I went with mixed feelings but ended up enjoying it tremendously.

I would rate this movie a must see.,Mission - Impossible II
901,jamesdutczak,Ugh.,3,25 May 2000,"Remember the good ol' days of watching Scooby-Doo on Saturday morning cartoons?  Every episode ended with the monster pulling off its rubber mask, revealing the real villain - usually some elderly disgruntled carnie.  At least Scooby-Doo only used this plot device once (maximum twice) per episode.  Mission Impossible 2 punches the envelope in a most pathetic way, utilizing this shallow plot device at least four times (perhaps even five). Gimme a break. John Woo's stylization of action sequences has been admirable in the past, but in this piece his over-use of slow motion is laughable.  I'm sure if the entire film was shown in real-time, it would only last 37 minutes.  It might look cool for a fight, but not for an entire feature. Tom Cruise places great faith in his image, taking the same self-glorifying risk that drowned Kevin Costner's career in Waterworld.  We all know how cool Tom Cruise is - but this much flexing and posing would be far more appropriate in an issue of Playgirl than on the screen, thank you very much. Despite my own distaste for the film as a whole, I must confess that the motorcycle chase scene at the climax of the film may be one of the most exciting and innovational chase sequences since The French Connection. Next time, build a better film to lead up to it.",Mission - Impossible II

I must confess, I never saw the first Mission Impossible.  Actually, you didn't need to see the T.V. series ever to watch this movie.  On the whole, it was enjoyable...I could put my brain into neutral and set it on Cruise-control for two hours (forgive the pun). Ok, so my roommate and I giggled alot more than we should have--we couldn't help it, some of the stunts were so laughably absurd!  But then, it wouldn't be Mission Impossible, if it wasn't at least a little campy.  All the gratuitous cleavage shots, the innuendo, and the ""thief-with-the-cold-exterior-but-deep-down-heart-of-gold"", all add elements to the typical SPY movie.  MI2 is no different--big explosions, cool shots, and superficial characters.  But hey, who said the movies had to be Oscar-worthy art films all the time.

I have to say Woo is one step closer to regaining his form.  MI:2 is his best film here in the state as of yet, and although it is not wall to wall action, the ending is as exciting as an American movie can get.  To see 2 guys on the beach kung-fu fighting with there guns blazeing, well thats just not typical Hollywood action fluff. Get rid of the love romance story line and we've got a near 4 star film.

John Woo is not a subtle director and this film proves that. It's clear the script was made for his style of film-making as opposed to a true MI sequel. All of the small details from the first film are lost.But now as a John Woo film, this movie is very good. Great fast paced action. Amazing camera work and Woo's trade mark doves are all in it.

During the movie I came to the conclusion that some people would not like this movie because of the use of slow-motion(which happens a lot).  However, I like the slow-motion technique John Woo uses, without it the movie would be to quick to really admire.  I also liked Tom Cruise in the movie although the long hair doesn't fit him as well as the short cut like in the original.  The supporting characters were I admit, overshadowed and never really used, especially the helicopter pilot.  Scoot plays a great villain even if he doesn't have the look that Gary Oldman or even an asian actor like Chow Yun Fat could have brought to the part but you wouldn't believe they would double as Tom Cruise.

Besides the highly publicized mountain climbing scene and a car chase, nothing much happens in the way of action for over an hour.  By the time the action does start, it's too little too late.  People change faces more times than Michael Jackson.  But you can usually figure out who it really is before they reveal themselves.  During the movie, an alarm went off in the theater.  I felt a strange peace settle over me, thinking it would be better to die in a fiery blaze then watch the rest of this movie but, alas, I was forced to suffer through the rest of this debacle.  If you sped up John Woos signature slow motion to real time, the movie would be about 30 minutes shorter and, not so coincidentally, the movie is about 30 minutes too long.  The special effects are good but, as we learned from terrible movies like ""Wild Wild West"" and ""Battlefield Earth"", you need more than special effects to carry a movie.

In the first 15-20 minutes it was not so badly done, but after that the story simply lost all dramatic suspense and conviction in a miserably failed attempt to turn an action film into some sort of ""artistic"" dance with overly-emphasized use of slow motion sequences. I have never in my life watched an action film with so many karate chops and gunshots and explosions, and so little suspense, so little thrill. Some of the characters, especially the key villain, were unconvincing and sort of not fully formed (the writers could take a few cues from the Bond movies), and director Woo seemed to think so highly of some of his ""inventions"" that he felt the need to repeat them over and over again (more than he should have to achieve the desired effect, e.g. the waves during the fight sequence at the end). The music was overdone and badly placed at times, too.

A Better Tomorrow, The Killer, Hard Boiled, Face/Off, were great films.  In my opinion, he is the penultimate action movie director.Now, let me get into MI2.  Except for the action sequences, I thought it was a horrible Hi-I'm-Tom-Cruise-watch-me-in-an-action-movie vehicle. Everything in this movie is everything that is NOT Mission Impossible. The original Mission Impossible TV show was suspense-based and most of the time after you watched an episode, you had to think about what just happened. The original MI team also didn't intentionally go head to head with danger, rather they used misdirection and camouflage to get away.  The first MI movie kept most of this premise.But not this movie.  The plot in this movie was weak.  The location was all wrong as well.  I like Australia, but I just don't see it as a location for international intrigue and terrorism.  There was no real MI team; Ving Rhames and the other guy seem to have been added in the movie just to make it look like a team.  Dougray Scott is a good actor, but not good for the role cause he's too much of a pretty boy to take seriously as a villain. They should have used a villainous looking actor like Robert Davi or Sean Bean.  John Woo was wasted on this movie in my opinion, because of the lack of a plot, uninteresting characters, and horrible dialogue are too heavy a burden for the action scenes to hold up.  If Tom Cruise wants to make an American James Bond style movie, he should buy the rights to A Man Called Flint and remake that instead.So if you love John Woo style action, go see this movie.

Directing: Woo is good with action movies. I should know, I've seen them. This wasn't his best. This had too much glamour and not enough darkness in the violence (trust me, the violence genres differ). Talking about glamour, what regular movie goer ever heard of John Woo before this movie? Shows what too much hype can do. It's only the second movie and I'm already sick of the franchise!!Script: Wow! Explosions, motorcycle chases, and a leading lady to die for. This sounds very original. . . If James Bond never existed. Why don't they just stamp 007 all over it like they really want to?OVERALL: Cruise fans will love this movie. It has the same crap in it as the last one without the complex storyline. Now crowds can understand it without thinking at all!!! (heard in a theater while watching MI2 on opening weekend from a Cruise fan - ""Wow, look at that! It exploded! Cool. . .""",Mission - Impossible II

I personally liked the first one better.",Mission - Impossible II

925,jwest1980,bad rap,6,23 June 2000,"This movie has gotten a bad reputation from many fans and reviewers for one reason only: its deviation from its predecessor. Had this been a stand alone movie, I think it would have been more warmly accepted. When you go to see this, your first instinct will be to compare it to the first MI movie. This, however is a big mistake in that you would be comparing apples to oranges. Pseudo-intellectuals loved MI one. They love the fact that while most movie watchers were turned off by the ridiculous plot twists and incomprehensible story line, they understood it. MI 2 on the other hand, is a higher than average bombastic action film along the lines of a James Bond movie. It was actually more entertaining than the first film. At least the entire cast wasn't killed in the first few frames. Is it true to the original TV show? I don't know. I never watched it anyway.",Mission - Impossible II
926,Brand_Old,A disappointing sequel which was focused more on action than plot,6,25 June 2000,"I must say that I really enjoyed the first Mission Impossible movie. It had a deep plot, and exciting, believable action sequences. It all flowed nicely and made an entertaining movie. This new MI movie is so focused on the action (you can thank John Woo for that) that there is hardly a plot at all. Sure, the action is intense, but a lot of it isn't believable at all, especially some scenes in the motorcycle chase. I don't know why they tried to turn Tom Cruise into a Jet Li, it just didn't work very well. The romance between Ethan and Nyah developed too quickly, so it didnt make much sense why they cared so much for each other, cause they pretty much just met. One more thing I didn't like in the movie was the overuse of the masks. In the first MI, the masks were used creatively and brought some big surprises. In this movie, the masks are overly used, and it's obvious to the viewer who is who. Anyways there was one big stretch in the middle of the film that was just amazingly boring, but thats ok, some parts of the movie were actually entertaining. It could've been a lot better if they spent more time on making this. 6/10",Mission - Impossible II
927,matrix1323,What an adrenaline rush action film!,10,27 June 2000,The action was totally great but the storyline was not that best as first one.

I really loved the action in the fortress and motorcycle chase and even also a mountain scene. That's why it is an adrenaline rush action film.,Mission - Impossible II

929,matthew.gream,"Very interesting post-modern hero, but a flawed implementation",8,13 July 2000,"The movie is interesting for the way that it seems to create a new age Bond, however the implementation of this idea is flawed - let us hope that it can be improved in the future.MI2 reads like a new age James Bond - the agent is no longer the tough and stiff upper lip martini kind of guy, but a new age relatively funky and post-modern person reflected through manner, speech, activities, attitudes and so on.The movie draws on multi-culturalism, with its mix of european, australian, american and asian dimensions - the stars, directors and personnel are all from varied backgrounds, and the plot although somewhat thin, contains various cultural elements. Sydney harbour with its Miami speed boat connotations and the almost asian fight sequences are examples of this, and the south african, american, european and australian characters.There are references to contemporary culture and issues: stock options and the internet (unfortunately almost somewhat tacky in its implementation), genetics and killer viruses, and corporatism, etc. The fortunicity of motorbikes on the fortress was also somewhat unbelievable, and the obligatory reference to Atlanta in relationship to Sydney in the context of the 2000 Olympics. I see the character stereotypes, they sort of work, and they are necessary because the genre is necessarily about archetypes and stereotypes, across people and society as a reflection of how it is, and where it is going right now.Filmed in Sydney - my home town - I can see some sort of Australianness in it : sort of less refined, but I can also see an almost post-modernist smirnoff blending of the real and surreal in Woos freeze frame sequences. The sensuality of the lead actress and her new age beauty combined with time blurred impressionistic cinematic sensuality are very seductive.I was actually disappointed, especially because there is a lot of opportunity for a good modernist version of the hero - the sort of new age global playboy rooted in a more relaxed and funky turn of the millennium lifestyle, with a new age heroic story (the ethical dilemmas facing the new world), and contemporary cinematic techniques (e.g. blurring of boundaries between time, space and reality a la smirnoff).Unfortunately it almost seems as though all of this was aimed for, but just couldn't didn't 'gel' together very well -- but perhaps this is a master reflection of contemporary society in the way that it trying to gel and fuse past and the present around the millennial epoch, and how post-millennial society has yet to be fully formed.This resonates particularly deeply for Australia, because as Australia searches for a multicultural identity, it adopts, combines, and mixes all manner of backgrounds into a mix that has yet to congeal.Perhaps in 10 years time, this this perspective will become be apparent in retrospect.",Mission - Impossible II

932,Craig-148,good story takes a nose-dive,4,8 July 2000,"This isn't really Mission Impossible, it's double-0 1 Tom Cruise working alone.  sorry, I don't consider sending in a recruited jewel theif and watching how she interacts with the bad guy much of a carefully crafted ""sting"" like the old MI episodes.OK, so it's not MI, but it's still a good spy story.  Tom Cruise has gotten beyond Risky Business -- he's a real actor now, as Eyes Wide Shut shows. Actually, he's the best thing in the whole film.  (though I'm not much of a Cruise fan.)Mr. Woo -- you sure pulled out all the Hollywood cliches in the book.  Two people gazing at each other across a dance floor -- must be love!  Sorry, I didn't find that convincing, and the two cars tangoing to the edge of the cliff... more unrealistic than the martial arts stuff that comes later.OK, my only other major gripe is with the jaunting motorcycles.  The shoot-em-up motorcycle chase, that was a thrill--one of the best chase scenes I've seen in a long time, too bad about the farcical chicken race at the end.Still, the story was good, I would have liked to seen it a bit more developed, but this is an action flick after all.  The high-tech gadgets: COOL!  the heroine's safe finding/breaking equipment--straight out of James Bond.  The exploding sunglasses were a bit much, but I think it was a plus that in the end, our hero didn't rely solely on gadgets, but did things the old fashion way -- tough guy style, like the original Bond (read the books.)OK, this isn't a gripe, but I thought the bad guy was just a really bad actor.  Totally exaggerated.  Is this guy supposed to be ruthless or just a big loud ego?  Very flat character, not at all matching Cruise's subtle and balanced acting.If you liked Romeo Must Die, you'll like MI2.  If you thought it was shallow, you'll think the same of MI2.

Some questionable product placement by various firms, though I suppose they had to have quite a lot of dollars to make an action-packed film.

If you're out there to see some really great special effects, you should better go and see the original. MI 2, sorry to say, is a disappointmemt.

935,a11yc,Dissapointing!!!!!,1,24 September 2000,"I went in to this movie expecting something great but left feeling kinda empty. For a John Woo movie there was a definite lack of action sequnces and the action sequences that were used were nothing spectacular. The acting was poor, the characters were so 1 dimensional it was unbelievable and the story was nothing original. I liked the first M:I film, it wasn't great but compared to this it was a masterpiece. This is if nothing else straight to video material, even John Woo's Blackjack was a better movie by far and it DID go straight to video!!! Overall this was a BAD film. I still can't belive I actually wasted my time seeing this, I couldv'e done something more interesting with my time like watching paint dry or the grass growing.",Mission - Impossible II
936,hearm,Too much fast-fight action,4,23 July 2000,"What I missed about this movie was the ""calm action"" that we found in the first Mission Impossible film. For example when Mr.Cruise is hanging in a cable, while a bunch of CIA agents are right outside the high-tech secured room. I didn't see much of that and it was just, too much action with too little ""agency"" action.It also seems that the movie copies some of the things from ""The Matrix"", like slow motion scenes with a man in dark colored trench coat shooting with UZI..get my point?I'm sorry but that movie is old news, been there, done that. We've seen it before!",Mission - Impossible II

Even when he doesn't well at the box office, he seems to get critical acclaim and vice versa. This is a big shift away from the first movie but I think it really works, Cruise can pull off the character very well although he is a bit over the top at times. I don't think the film puts any real emphasis on the other characters in the film which is poor but the story is good enough and the action is superb. It's the new '007' for sure, we could end up with endless 'Mission Impossible' movies but as long as they are as good as the first two, I won't be complaining.",Mission - Impossible II

940,suziq2307,One of the Best Movies of the Summer of 2000!!!,10,23 August 2000,"First of all, I am very disappointed to hear all the negative reviews on this movie.  I am also glad that at least 1/2 of the reviews were good. Now to my review on this movie.First of all, I saw Tom Cruise for the first time on the ""big screen"" in this movie.  I thought that his performance as Ethan Hunt was positively mesmerizing!  In my opinion, his acting was very good and he showed a side of Ethan Hunt's personality that was not portrayed in the previous movie. Even when he doesn't talk, he is acting.  Just look at the expressions on his face when he doesn't speak.  I think that he was very convincing as Hunt and that he was sensitive and caring in his feelings for Nyah.  As for their chemistry, it was awesome, romantic and cute! Who says that you can't fall in Love after one night.  There are some people in this world who have done it!I think that Tom Cruise is a very extraordinary actor.  After viewing this movie a few weeks ago for the first time, I took it upon myself to rent his other movies.  I feel that he has done equally well in all of his movies. Some of them are truely Oscar worthy performances.Back to MI-2. Tom has matured since his role as Ethan in the last movie. He is very handsome, sweet, sensitive and caring and was generally concerned for the welfare of the people of Australia, as well as the world.  By the way, he was supposed to be a super-spy and therefore he acted accordingly. Some of his stunts were unbelievable, but they were supposed to be!! Wake up! I thoroughly enjoyed his performance.  Nyah was also interesting, pretty and a good actress.  I felt a little jealous of her!  Dougray Scott was OK as the villian and the actor that portrayed Luther was great. The other cast members were good performers.I never felt that this movie was a ""Tom Cruise Ego Trip"" as many of you have stated, but that he was thoroughly enjoying himself in this movie and that he worked hard in giving his all to this movie, both in acting and producing. He is a very serious man when it comes to his acting (I read his book and he is a very interesting person in many ways). I give him credit for doing many of his own stunts (they were spectacular)!  I also enjoyed the directing style of John Woo.  I did not know his previous work, with the exception of Face Off, which I found enjoyable. MI-2 just blew me away!!!MI-2 was spectacular, awe inspiring, great eye-candy, romantic, an edge on your seat action thriller, had great special effects and had wonderful cinematography.  I thought that the script wasn't half as bad as a lot of you have mentioned and I give Tom Cruise, John Woo and Robert Towne credit for collaborating and producing a great Summer movie!  I have seen 4 of the new Summer movies and MI-2, bar none, was the best movie this Summer.In conclusion, I just want to say to the people who bashed this movie, that apparently you are either jealous of Tom Cruise or you don't know how to sit back, enjoy and be thoroughly entertained by a good action-packed Summer movie. I also liked MI and I found it easy to understand the plot! I have regretted not seeing the first MI in the theater, I saw it on video. This movie is totally different from that movie, but that is OK as they are supposed to be two different kinds of movies.  I found this movie more exciting than the first. This movie was pure entertainment and I felt good after seeing it.  This movie was nothing short of exhilerating. Incidentally, I have seen it several times and it gets better every time!!! The score was also fantastic!  I am not a ""heavy metal fan"" but I thoroughly enjoyed this score.Go and see this movie on the ""big screen"".  You will not regret it!!!!!!I give this movie a 10 out of 10!",Mission - Impossible II
941,suziq2307,One of the Best Action-Thriller Movies of the Summer!,10,24 August 2000,"First of all, I am very surprised about all the bad reviews that I have read on this movie.  Thank God there are some good reviews, about 1/2.I would like to comment on how stylish and breathtaking this movie is.  I have never seen Tom Cruise on the ""big screen"" until I saw MI-2 back in the end of July.  I was totally blown away with this movie.  After I saw this movie, I went out and rented all of his other movies.  Many of them were Oscar worthy material and he is one of the best actors to hit the theaters in a long time.I especially give him credit for his collaboration with John Woo on this movie.  It looks like they put a lot of time and effort into making this a blockbuster!  I believe that it has surpassed expectations and has become one of the hottest movies of the Summer.Now to my review of this movie.  I thought that Tom Cruise was outstanding as Ethan Hunt.  He expanded his character to be more sexy, romantic, sensitive, caring and cool and he knew how to get the job done. We just didn't see this side of his character in MI-1, except being intelligent and getting the job done.  But don't get me wrong, MI-1 was a great movie.  I also was one of the people who actually understood the plot!  I have always regretted that I have not seen MI-1 in the theater, I saw it on video. But you can't compare the two movies.  They were completely different.  I think that I read an article where Tom stated that he wanted every MI movie to be different.  MI-2 is more of an action-thrill ride than the first movie and that was all it was supposed to be!!!Tom did a great job in acting this role.  It seems to have been a lot of fun for him along with his hard work as Producer as well.  His producing and John Woos directing spell SUCCESS! I also give him credit for doing the majority of his own stunts.  How many actors today would take the risk?I also thought that the other actors, Vring Rjames, Dougray Scott, Anthony Hopkins, were also very good, as well as Thandie Newton, in their respective roles.  I thought that they complimented Tom Cruise very well!!Contrary to many of the other reviews on the plot, I thought that the plot was interesting (not stupid), fun to watch, an exhilarating action thriller and pure entertainment.I thought (contrary to some reviews), that the chemistry between Ethan Hunt and Nyah Nordoff Hall was mesmerizing, cute, romantic, sexy and great to watch.  Tom has never looked better.  He is absolutely gorgeous! and she is very beautiful.  I feel a little jealous of her!!! I would like to comment also on Tom's non-speaking acting.  His expressions on his face are priceless.  Without saying a word, you know exactly what he is feeling. He definitely did not want Nyah anywhere near Shawn Ambrose, but he also knew that he had a job to do. Having Nyah as a Trojan horse in the clutches of his nemesis was the only way to get the information he needed to save the world from catastrophy!I certainly did not think that this movie was a ""Tom Cruise Ego Trip"".  He was playing a super-spy and just acted accordingly.  To the people who trashed his performance, I have this to say, Lighten Up!  You must be extremely jealous of him or you do not know how to sit back, relax and enjoy a fun and exciting Summer movie.  It wasn't supposed to make you think. It was supposed to entertain you!!!!  I think that you people need a life!In conclusion, let me add that I have since seen this movie several times and I think that it gets better each time I see it!  I previously did not know John Woos work as an action director, with the exception of Face Off, which I loved.  I think that He did a brilliant job in directing this movie. I think that he wanted people to see all the (cliches) of his other movies in this movie.  Apparently, that is his style and he does it well. Also, the cinematography was spectacular!If you still haven't seen this movie, than I won't spoil it for you.  See it.  You won't regret it!Congratulations Tom and John on a job well done!  I will be anxiously awaiting MI-3.I give this movie 10 out of 10 stars!!!!!!!!!!!",Mission - Impossible II

But what a total disaster this movie. The acting of all the main characters is really bad. The scene where Tom meets the woman behind the back of the villa sticks in mind as worst acting/directing moment ever. John Woo zooms in on his face then tells him from behind the camera 'yes look mean, really mean, like you did not get your cereals this morning'. And then gives the viewer, what seems like 2 minutes to admire an 'angry' looking Tom Cruise.Besides from the bad acting, the director should stick to video clips. He uses slowmotion at silly moments in the movie, only for effect. Then he uses the some 'face off' faces in this film as in face-off. And the action scenes slow-motion/the matrix/kung fool, have been done enough now. The ending scene with the 15 minute chase on the motorbike is sleep provoking.The romantic interest is build up by a teenager, you never feel there was any 'magic' between the characters, it's just a 'sex-interest'. John Woo if you got any money for this movie, you should give it back and then some..To sum it up : Worst bigbudget movie ever, The dvd is going back to the store.",Mission - Impossible II

If you are into endless action scenes of bullets bouncing off paper items and oil drums blowing up etc. and have a low IQ then waste some money and see this garbage. The A team has better scripts and action scenes than this movie. I am even ashamed to be Scottish after seeing a fellow countryman appear in this movie.

After 5 minutes watching the movie, the story line becomes apparent. The story line is characteristic of the eastern genre, as it is directed by John Woo. It looks like his difficulties in speaking English became apparent in the storyline and thus the action part of the movie was concentrated. If you like action...then buy it. But if you like a good, interesting storyline......then bash the bishop...literally!Tons of flaws apparent in the film, best example is that they are running round like headless chickens chasing a deadly virus, the bad guys kill a guy by containing him and watching him rot away..  thing is towards the end the heroine runs round infected with this virus and no one gets infected!!!

You would know John Woo was involved by the inclusion of doves flying through the under ground lair shortly after an explosion! I just don't get the dove thing.It is a pretty straight forward, brain at the door action movie but the real problem with it is the huge inconsistencies throughout the movie. OK, the acting is a bit crappy, there's the token love interest and everything else is pretty forgettable but its an action movie, thats their nature sometimes.The 'chase' scenes are awful to be fair to them, especially the motorbike one. How is it that his bike doesn't explode when his gas tank is hit but everything he shoots blows up? How can a bullet fired almost directly at you shatter the visor on the bike and not hit the passenger? Then to top it all off before duelling with there bikes on the sand, the high performance road bikes take an off camera pit-stop to change the slick tires to off-road.

John Woo has Tom jumping, rolling, sliding, shooting, kicking and punching, in this MUST SEE for any action fan.  All of Woo's movies has proved that no one does action like the master of action.

One of the major ones -spoiler here- is the whole mask thing in the end.  Sure, I'd under stand Hunt bringing a mask of the villain, but why in the world would he bring a mask-of himself? Thinking ahead, would he put it on himself to disguise himself as himself? Oh, and of course we can't leave out Cruises amazing acting skills.

956,mrmadcow66,John Woo is one of the worst directors alive.,1,15 June 2002,"There's not much to say about this movie.  I don't know why, but for some reason before I saw this I thought John Woo was a good director.  I guess because Face/Off was pretty good.  I now know I was horribly, horribly wrong.  He drastically needs to get over himself.  No more super kick combo moves.  No more white doves.  No more flying motorcycles.  It's just stupid. How he could take something as great as the first Mission: Impossible and turn it into this is beyond me.  The plot of a ""horrible disease to be released on Earth"" lacks enough originality to even be the plot of a Bond film.  Please don't make anymore movies John.  You suck at it.",Mission - Impossible II
957,rpantucci,atrocious,1,6 September 2002,"a truly dire piece of cinema, the first was a great flick, intricate clever, action filled and well acted. Well as well as the cruiser can, and to be honest all emmanuel beart did was pout prettily, but this did deflect from her personality void rather effectively. anyhoo, i digress, what bugged me about this is john woo mostly. who i rate highly, though of late have become bored with his indelible mark, which does never really veer away from a collection of set pieces; standoffs with unloaded guns; a hero and a paraiah; while this seems a harsh indictment of an action film as i suppose they are kinda essential qualities for a rootin-tootin action piece. john woo seems to have created a cookie cutter shape that he merely presses against whichever franchise he has been handed that month. kudos to the guy for bringing some of the lyricism of chinese action films to hollywood, but this was a distintcly poor comparison to his earlier stuff",Mission - Impossible II

The fight choreographer (Billy Morts, also X2, Charlie's Angels 2) is weak compared to most John Woo films, and there's barely a drop of blood despite countless explosions.  Blood is a good thing in the John Woo movies, but Hollywood doesn't like it.The plot couldn't power a KIA up Beverly Hills, and Tom Cruise could barely push it.For all the threat to the entire world (of course they never talk about the Greek myth that is the namesake of the threat), you are never really scared.

960,baladev,The movie was good and lots of amazing actions.,9,10 February 2006,"All I can say is two-thumbs up for Tom Cruise and John Woo, they make a big difference for movies. I really admire Tom Cruise he's so gifted from looks to talent. I just wonder why there are some people who hate him and getting annoyed to him. Maybe they are only envy or they are really just different. But I can say also that there are scenes in the movie that are actually impossible to happen (hence, mission: impossible) and to perform in real life. It's just really a fiction and good for movies/entertainment only. Oh what the hell am I talking about. I also noticed that some people called Cruise as 'pathetic', which I also does. It seems that Cruise just only want to portray his being hero in the films he stars. It does look pathetic, doesn't it?",Mission - Impossible II
961,jereme-samuel,"Not as good, but close to the original",8,27 March 2012,"Despite the fantastic action scenes and the fairly solid story line, MI2 did have a few low points. First on all, that love story seemed quite out of place. I mean it was a change but it seemed a little forced. Then there was that constant use of those masks that were made famous from the first flick. I mean how many masks could they possible have!!??!! And last but not least...I know that John Woo is famous for his remarkable action sequences and that his technique is to put portions of it into slow motion and then speed it up at the last second, but it was just used far to much in this film. I understand that sometimes it is a good effect so that the audience can see exactly what is happening, but this time it was just overkill. The movie would have been shorter if all these slow motion scenes were eliminated, because with them, it just seemed to drag on a little too long.In spite of the minor problems that the film has, it will still make millions, because of Tom Cruise alone, but Thandie Newton did a wonderful job, playing opposite the star and Dougray Scott, who was last scene in Ever After, portrayed an excellent foil for Cruise's character. Fans of both Cruise and the original television series will enjoy this flick, but first time MI viewers will enjoy it because you did not have to see the first one to understand what was going on in the second one, as is the case with most sequels. All in all a good action-packed movie, well worth the money and definitely a big screen movie. Don't miss this one at the theaters if you are into the big summer action movies.

962,miriamlaufey,The awfulness is amazing,1,8 May 2006,"Wow. I've seen lots of bad movies and lots of bad sequels, but this one was just incredibly bad. I didn't even know it was possible to sink that low. And it wasn't even bad in a funny way, but simply bad in an extremely painful way. I don't even know why I watched it to the end.The story is nothing but a series of clichés. The bad guys have stolen a killer virus and are intending to let it loose to make a fortune selling the antidote. Very predictable, eh? The characters couldn't be more two-dimensional if they were in a Nintendo game. Being a tomboy, I absolutely hate it when women in movies have no personality and are just added in as a love interest. Nyah, the chick in MI2, is a perfect example of this. She was the only female in the entire film and her sole purpose was to be sexy (as is subtly shown by several pointless cleavage shots). Sure, the movie wants you to think that she could kick ass if she wanted to by making her a professional thief, but isn't very convincing at that. In the end, while Tom Cruise is engaged in a very unrealistic battle sequence on a beach, she roams around aimlessly, considering the possibility of throwing herself off a cliff (which would have been a relief).I was going to talk about the extremely pointless car chase sequence between the hero and the chick, in which they demolish their cars for no reason whatsoever, but I don't really know what to say about it.The only good thing about this film is that it was so boring that I preferred doing the homework I'd been postponing for ages to watching the dumb motorcycle chases.",Mission - Impossible II
963,le_smat_des_smat,not bad and above average,6,20 November 2012,"Mission impossible 2 is an interesting movie to look at. The visuals( action scenes) are good as I am a John woo fan but the story is just an excuse to have a good time watching those action set pieces.The story as I said is not the strenght of this flick. Its simple and overall just nothing special. Tom cruise is good as always in the role of Ethan Hunt but the villain and supporting actress are dull and stereotypes of James Bond characters.What's steals the show are two thing: the 3rd part of the movie and the style and the way John Woo manage to do those two things together and almost feels like poetry: the sunset, the locations, the fight at the end and the music theme with electric guitar feels like a good mix. John Woo manage to do a pretty good job despite all the flaws.Overall its not bad if you want a good time check it out but don't expect a masterpiece. Its a decent action flick but not as good as other instalments in the series.",Mission - Impossible II
964,deckard39,"An awesome, balls-in-your-face action movie",8,21 June 2008,"Let me just start by saying that if you're looking for the spy atmosphere of the first one, look somewhere else or watch that movie again. Even though this is a sequel, it completely veers away from the paranoia seen in the first film and gives us a shot of adrenaline. It begins with Ethan Hunt being given a new mission while on vacation. The mission entails recruiting a thief, Naya,(Thandie Newton) to infiltrate one of Ethan's old operatives who's stolen an important virus and it's antidote with the intention of infecting the population and selling to the highest bidder. Everything goes good until it doesn't and Ethan enlists the help of some friends (Ving Rhames and John Polson) to help him steal and destroy the virus. The movie is directed by John Woo and that means all kinds of impossible acrobatics from pistols to motorcycles to hand to hand combat. The action in this movie delivers, not giving us a boring minute. The spy aspect of the movie plays its necessary part but doesn't overshadow the action. This is a movie on par with Desperado and the Bourne movies so if that's your taste, check this out",Mission - Impossible II
965,Count_Strangle,Not as good as the first one!,6,27 October 2004,"Although the film is quite good, I think the first one was better because it was clever and actually required some brain to understand it.I think the action in 'II' is good but the storyline is fairly flat. The makers of the film tried to make it too much like a James Bond film and not stick with the more intelligent aspects of it. If they could have combined the two styles then it would have been one kick ass film, but as they didn't it left me feeling rather disappointed after the first film. It seemed to be a bit of a 'Cruise' show, which is always bad in films. Films that just focus entirely on one person are hardly ever good.",Mission - Impossible II

I love this film. Though the plot itself isn't overly excellent, it is well acted, especially by Dougray Scott, who definitely made his character (the villain) his own. Cruise was a little too smooth however, and it would have been nice to have seen more emotion in his acting. The special effects were pure class, typical Woo.

968,williamspencer-29395,A strange failure for the series...,2,22 June 2018,"This movie sucks, but it's strange how it fails.When you get down to the Mission: Impossible series, all of them are almost the exact same story told over and over again. And yet they all work despite the fact that they always have the same beats. Each one involves Ethan Hunt getting disavowed by the IMF and having to work with the barebones essentials without the safety net of the government. He always has to break in to a place before someone else does, usually involving great heights. And the climax is always an insane chase sequence. But, they all work because instead of coming to the movies for the plots, you come to it to see how each director gives his stamp to the same plot.Except for this one - for the most part. It very much has the same action beats - especially the break-in and the chase scene - but is done in such a bloated, boring, bombastic way that it kind of feels like the cinematic equivalent of television static. They trade the ""we're on our own, guys. We need to find who's framing us,"" storyline for some sort of riff on ""The Spy Who Loved Me,"" and in trying something new, it accidentally fails the worst.On the series' standards, there's really two big failures: one, Ethan is never disavowed, so the tension of a man left to his guns is non-existent. Two, and the far bigger sin is the fact that there's never really the big Tom Cruise stunt set-piece that we're looking forward to. The closest is the opening credits rock climb sequence, but that's not some big setpiece with stakes -- it's just the character's intro. He doesn't really have anything for the story to move forward, and in context, it's just Ethan Hunt on vacation. He does this for fun, so we're not in suspense at anything he's doing. So, if anything, this sequence actually damns the rest of the movie because there's no big stunt for him to top maybe outside of the chase at the end.Thandie Newton really is the MacGuffin, and I don't really want to put most of the blame on her, but too much of it is her fault. She's more annoying and smug that charming, and so we don't really care about this whole ""Spy Who Loved Me"" thing her and Ethan are going through.Dougary Scott as the villain... I actually don't remember anything about him other than how he acts when he's first introduced, and he's one of those bad guys who's more just smug and evil for the sake of being evil. He actually reminds me a lot of how horribly Rupert Everett played Doctor Claw in the ""Inspector Gadget"" movie. He's not as bad, but he definitely belongs in the same vein.The Mission: Impossible series actually creates an interesting timeline of blockbuster action movies at the time each was made, and this one really may just be a victim of timing. John Woo was no longer this beloved Hong Kong-action maestro; he was more of a poor man's Michael Bay who's style was really getting stale at that point. It also represents the era where script doctors were over-used. It's not like they haven't been rampant for the last 25+ years, but this era especially had this problem where it felt like every single page of the script was written by a different writer.The saddest, though, must be Hans Zimmer... my God, HOW could he make a score this boring? He decided to base it heavily in guitars, mainly electric and Spanish acoustic. The electric makes it feel like a try-hard college freshman frat-bro, the kind that blasts the loudest metal he can out of his stereo. It's the lamest, it's like Nirvana trying to be Limp Bizkit. I think he was trying to off-set the ""loud, energetic, bombastic"" electric with the ""cool, serene, laid-back"" Spanish acoustic, but it is just so boring and pretentious. It's not calming us down, it's lulling us to sleep. It might just be my musical tastes repelling that really acoustic sound - I hate it, it just sounds like a guitar being tuned - but at the same time, I should not be thinking that something by the guy who did the music to ""The Lion King"" is not done as well as it was in ""Spy Kids."" Yes. ""Spy Kids,"" and I think that's because Robert Rodriguez is actually Mexican, and was using the guitar to compose, not as an esthetic. I always thought that maybe this series needs to stick to the same story line to keep interesting, just having the director spice it up, and for the most part that has been the case. However, Rogue Nation is basically what this movie was trying to be without abandoning the staples of the franchise and coming out at a time when not all action movies sucked. So, not only does it make this a failed experiment, but the fact that that movie exists, and succeeds, makes this movie entirely pointless, not even for curiosity's sake. I have the blu-rays of the series, but to be completely honest, I haven't used this one for anything other than a coaster.",Mission - Impossible II

Some great scenes also were when Tom goes in the building head first and when Ambrose tries to kill Tom with a Knife and the knife stops at the edge of his eyelash. Those Were great scenes.The first scene of Tom Cruise Mountain climbing was breath taking. And the 30 minute motorcycle scene was just great. John Woo and Tom Cruise do it again by making a phenominal movie.I cant decide which movie was better this one or Part 1 both were excellent. Makers of James Bond should watch this movie. This movie was 100 times better then their movie the World Is Not Enough.The sound track of course was very good.Everything in the movie was perfect except the girl, Nayah.

I am obviously referring to the old trick in which the characters all have masks that look identical to the person they are attempting to portray.  They don't use this ploy once, not twice, but three times.In the end I would not waste my money on such a mindless film.",Mission - Impossible II
995,dawg-15,Overall pretty good;,10,5 June 2000,but it wasn't nearly up to the first movie.  For instance in both movies you had the drops; in the first one it was into the mainframe at Langley and you had to wonder if he was going to make it in and out.  In this one it was into a vent shaft and he was dropping prior to it opening.  Obviously you knew it would open; you can't have the hero going splat halfway through the movie.  It's that kind of thing that kept it from being as exciting a movie as the first one.  In addition John Woo uses way too much slow motion and way too much martial arts in it.,Mission - Impossible II
996,Shogun-14,First movie I walked out on this Summer,1,30 May 2000,"If they took out the slow motion shots, this movie would be 20 minutes long. Lack of an interesting story, uninteresting characters, cheesy dialogue and boring action scenes makes this the second biggest joke this summer. Battlefield Earth already won the biggest joke award thus far.",Mission - Impossible II
997,davebgray,"Entertaining, enjoyable, and cool.",8,1 June 2000,"MI2 isn't the best movie out there, but what do you expect from another summer blockbuster?  MI2 is, however, extremely entertaining.  It is far fetched just like many action movies, with bullets a-plenty, but if that's what you're going for, MI2 is well done.  Jon Woo's directing style is very present (with slow-motion, quiet action sequences), and it fit's the mood perfectly.  The movie also is fair to the spy element of the series. Overall, I didn't walk out of the film a changed man, but I was jumping around and battling my friends on the way out to the car.",Mission - Impossible II
998,v6r,failure,5,30 May 2000,"<spoiler> M:I-II was a failure of a movie. It failed to equal the original in terms of character development and it failed as a stand-alone action film when compared to other movies. Where was Henry Czerny's Kittridge, a great actor with a great character?  Where was the great fight scenes equal to The Matrix?  Where were the great car chase scenes equal to Ronin? Why the senseless murder of hundreds of people at the beginning of the film? Save your money and rent the original movie, along with the Matrix and Ronin.",Mission - Impossible II
999,dvdswing,"Disapointing, 1 was better",6,25 May 2000,"I love the first one but MI2 just does not make the cut. The first 2/3rds of this movie drag then finally pick up. There is no teamwork like in 1. It is completely centered around Ethan Hunt. No cool gadgets except for the glasses. The plot was very transparent. It is unfortunate that you have to change a good script ala ""MI1"" so that the average joe in number 2 can figure it out.",Mission - Impossible II
1000,Chey-2,Great action film.,10,27 May 2000,"The basic plot is well done and interesting with enough twists and turns to keep one's attention.  The movie moves swiftly and easily with lots of action.  Great casting and just enough use of technology and special effects.  Much superior to the first Mission Impossible movie, which seemed convoluted and in some parts totally dumb.",Mission - Impossible II
1001,anatiz,I was terribly disappointed!,1,4 July 2000,"This film has nothing to do with the original concept, except for the music! To me, it looked more like Mortal Combat or Rocky 17; it is loaded with aggression. The female participant did nothing interesting except making mistakes as a thief and sacrificing herself. What does all that have to do with planning, espionage, excelled rational agents? The main character is even known by name to his mortal enemy! I remember that the bad guys never, ever knew what had happened to them: they were cleverly deceived, and did not have a clue on how, when or by whom, that was the real mission... I am completely, totally, absolutely disappointed.",Mission - Impossible II
1002,zerocelvin,A Movie by John WOOOW!,10,25 February 2001,"Mission Impossible I. Was an OK Movie, good but not fantastic. My expectations on the sequel were not very high but John Woo is my favorive director so it couldn´t be boring at least. After only 5 minutes i realised that this was not an ordinary actionmovie.The start (planecrash/rockclimbing) is so thrilling and entertaining that your eyes pops out!Then Woo accelerate.The plot is not the brightest i have seen, but i works perfect with the energy of the film and is not so confused as M:i-1.Tom C mission is to find a deadly virus stolen by a mad australian, Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) by contacting his ex-girlfriend Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) and convince her to help him.This feels a bit like a combination of a Hong Kong movie and a James Bond film. The Action-sequences are so unrealistic that you don´t even think about if it can be don! And they are one of the best i have seen ever!Woo is the man and this is his best movie ever! And the 2nd best actionmovie ever (T2 is the best). It´s so cool that it´s almost a Comedy.I have only one complain: The fight is far too long and too brutal (no blood, but brutal in another way). But that is what Woo does best, Terrible Beauty.See it, that a direct order!",Mission - Impossible II
1003,sylvie1231,Very disappointing.,4,3 June 2000,"Slow first half which focuses on development of  an unconvincing romance between Cruise and the female lead The action finally picks up in the second half but fans of the first film will find themselves longing for Jean Reno and his helicopter.  Thankfully Ving is here but even his solid, believable performance is not enough to offset the tedium of the incredible number of Cruise close ups (most in slow motion) that we are forced to endure.  If you are really into Tom Cruise's face, this is the film for you.",Mission - Impossible II
1004,jamblastx,Eye candy without much substance,3,31 May 2000,"MI2 will probably not bore you but you can surely find better ways of occupying your time.  As with most of these blockbuster box office winner movies out there, MI2 shares not a whole heck of a lot with the television show of which it is based.",Mission - Impossible II
1005,alexdias-3,Just Bad.,4,29 May 2000,"This is a very bad movie. The Producer and Star Mr. Cruise should have chosen better. The Director John Woo is wrong for this kind of project, he probably never watch the original show in TV, he doesn't care about the actors he just wants to do some cliches action scenes (sometimes pretty good ones). The girl Thandie Newton with the cheap Target's wardrobe is very weak. She doesn't have any charm. The script has literally dozens of holes. It's missing the Team work, the girl is there just to bang the bad guy, one is a chopper pilot, and Ving Rhames (from the first movie) just use the computer and one machine gun. The ""plot"", which is one of the most characteristic thing of the series, there's none. Anyway it's just some James Bond style bad movie with a very handsome Tom Cruise and nothing else.",Mission - Impossible II
1006,sekhon,better than the original,9,31 May 2000,looks like cruise has finally figured out what it takes to make a good action flick.  much better than the original and has an almost understandable plot. well worth the $7.50 I spent on it.  the new girl is exotic and pretty,Mission - Impossible II
1007,Keyser-42,Clunk...the sound of me checking my brain at the door,10,24 May 2000,"Why is it that people expect this movie to answer some deep philosophical conflict that plagues humankind? If you go in there expecting American Beauty, you'll be duly disappointed. Just sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride.Ugh, the action was good. Woo is GOD! But yes - he still has failed to live up to his Hong Kong expectations thus far, but he's getting pretty damned close.",Mission - Impossible II
1008,Jackson-24,Mission: Action,3,27 May 2000,"When I went to see MI2 i had the first movie in mind, which was a mistake. The first one had an interesting plot, espionage, intrigue, suspense and charicters who seemed somewhat realistic.   The second one replaced these aspects of the movie with some well done action sequences.  Everything that the Mission: Impossible was Mission: Impossible 2 was not.  The action sequences actually made sense in the first one, where as in Mission: Impossible 2 it was obvious that the plot was constructed as to fit around the action sequences.  On the whole, where Mission: Impossible was a smart espionage movie, Mission: Impossible 2 is a clone of some of the new cheesey James Bond flicks.If mindless action is your thing, you'll want to see Mission: Impossible 2, but if you like a plot to go along with good action, just rent Mission: Impossible.",Mission - Impossible II
1009,macarron,Let down of the summer,2,28 May 2000,"I wasn't expecting a great film when I went to see M:I 2, but I was expecting something as good as the first. Unfortunately what I got was one of the worst films of the summer season. I am a huge fan of John Woo, but I have to admit that maybe even he needs to stop and think about what he s doing to a film before he releases it. The first film was well-paced and had plot twists which were surprising. M:I 2 is slow and doesn't once leave the audience guessing what is happening. Whoever said that M:I 2 is action packed must be comparing it to ""Beaches."" The action takes forever to develop and when it does it's over before you realize it. Another annoying factor in this movie is Woo's apparent love of slow-motion. Every scene seems to have a point of slow-mo even if it is absolutely unnecessary. Avoid this movie if you can, do not waste your money!!",Mission - Impossible II
1010,defendo,So BAD...that it's funny!,1,31 May 2000,"Following the success of both the television series and the feature film from 1996, John Woo was given the opportunity to use his 'skill' as an action film director on the much anticipated sequel.  The audience was delighted to see the film break an all-time record for use of slow-motion as well as one of the most drawn-out chase scenes ever recorded!  Woo continued to keep the viewer in suspense with more masks than a really bad Scooby-Doo episode.  Tom Cruise collects more air miles then the ill-fated plane seen in the films' opening sequence and the lead 'actress' has almost as many lines as the blonde kidnapper opposite Steve Buscemi in Fargo.  Anthony Hopkins' performance is reduced to a few seconds cut subliminally into frames of Cruise and his co-stars dodging bullets while driving backwards down a cliff on motorcycles.  The unforgettable finish to this masterpiece has some guy doing something.  It truly was a treat.",Mission - Impossible II
1011,wind-9,I'll be going at least one more time,9,25 May 2000,"Seldom have I experienced a film where I've been made to laugh at the audacity of the scenes and at the same time felt a rush of more overwhelming feelings that range from sheer amazement, to breathtaking appreciation to intense levels to fun that all combine to resemble something like ""damn that was a great scene"".  And there's more than enough great scenes flowing together to result in the culmination of a good, if not great, movie.For all the Bruckheimer/Cage fiascos of recent years, this film goes a long way towards redeeming those sins.  Great directing, good acting and a ""impossible"" story may make you wink back at the screen from time to time but at least you're not wincing.  I was too busy smiling with some big eyes and wishing I had the remote for my DVD.",Mission - Impossible II
1012,ddacey,Mission Impossible Mate,2,13 June 2000,"Hi folks, Ok let's start with the Good: The rock-climbing scene at the beginning the movie is great and the music that accompanies this scene almost promises that this film might be something good.The shots of Sydney are nice and they even managed to fit something other then the Sydney harbour bridge in. ;)The bad: No we really don't sound like that ""mate"". The accent was soooo overdone -especially at the beginning of the movie, that you could see the Australian audience cringing in the cinema. Shame it was an Australian actor trying to sound like a really overdone Aussie, but I guess that's what the producers thought overseas audiences expected us to sound like. The only redeeming part about this was the fact that the South African accent of another character was even worse.Why did Tom hide out in an outback sheep station? I mean that would be hours of flight time in a helicopter to Sydney. There would have been heaps of better places to hang out that would have had rivers and trees and all that green stuff. Whoops. Remember the clichéd Australia! If you don't live in Sydney, you must live on a sheep station. There are going to be a lot of confused tourists during the Olympics, when they find out we talk different and most have never been to a sheep station!Hey maybe I shouldn't criticise the clichéd stuff as most countries, other then America seem to cop this, but Tom Cruise knows much better. With an Australian wife he spends a lot of time out here and knows how crap this stuff all is. It would have been nice if he had been a bit more honest in how he showed Australians and Australia.The action scenes were slow and few coming, so I was glad when we got to the chase scenes. First we had mostly older cars (Australian built Ford Falcons) blow up all over the place - even on wooden bridges, with no damage to the bridge of course and then, having gotten rid of them we had the bikes. The bikes went on and on and on, basically going on until the stunt riders had run out of ideas about what else they could do. The problem was that disbelief was an early victim of this scene, having spun out and crashed long before the bikes had done the same. Hey this is an action film and fiction, so I am happy to suspend belief, but this sort of stuff just kept on coming until you couldn't help but think 'enough!'Maybe all of this could be forgiven if it had a good story. Well it seems some people found the first movie (which did have a plot) to hard to handle - sore heads from thinking and all that. So they dumbed this movie down and then did it again just to be sure. We have so little plot that it could be written on a napkin. Just to make sure we get it this time though, the main points are gone over at least a couple of times in the movie. A good thing perhaps for Australian audiences as early on we are still getting over the Aussie accent.Anyway if you are guessing I didn't enjoy this film, you would be right. It's been getting fair to poor reviews in Australia and frankly it deserves them. A big disappointment for a John Woo directed film.My advice is to wait until it's on cable.Regards, Daniel",Mission - Impossible II

Don't do it!IF someone offers you cash money, up front, just to go see this movie! Please! PLEASE !! Stay home with Regis Philbin, or re-watch the summer re-runs!!I would not inflict this movie on my worst enemy! Why would you do this to us, Tom Cruise!I liked ""The Firm!"" I liked ""A Few Good Men"". I've even met people who say they liked ""Interview With A Vampire!"" [Though they asked me not to use their real names! ]************************* I confess it!!! I looked forward to this movie.I have watched the original Mission Impossible (1996) nearly 50 times, and I could not wait for this sequel.I figured: Oh, let's see more special effects, neat gadgets, great music, great sound effects, beautiful people doing very bad things in exotic locations! Round it off with an intelligent plot with a nice moral at the end. Voila!I hoped for the best!But, I confess that I also hedged my bet! I waited till this movie made $80 Million dollars, before I gave them another $8.00 for my ticket!Well, let me tell you, at $8 bucks a ticket, I figure that means that me and about 8 million others out there were robbed!You hear me Tom Cruise! I was robbed! I demand a refund!""Tom Cruise, I want a refund.! E-mail me directly and let me know where I can pick it up. ""Folks, this is absolutely the worst movie, one could have possibly imagined Cruise coming up with.[ ""Tom, the universe is very unhappy with you, boy! ]+++++++++++++++++""Mission Impossible 2"", as a movie is Tom Cruise's narcissism exposed at its worst! We see Tom Cruise, long-haired, making meaningless tortuous (shirtless) climbs up the side of ""nowhere in the desert"" mountains, to pick up what ? --- Why, its the video of his next highly secret mission, of course! Which is conveniently dropped to him in a canister from a mysterious black helicopter passing overhead. Why? Because Tom Cruise forgot to take his cell phone ! (I am NOT making this up folks! I actually paid money to see this!).Real tense, huh?This movie is also a ""Matrix"" wannabe rip-off. Realizing this alone, can make it embarrassing for us to sit there and watch all the stolen material. Stolen are the flying kicks, the slow-motion feet-over-head shooting sequences, even the costume Tom Cruise wears looks like it was lifted right from the Matrix wardrobe property room!The only apparently original footage in this movie, the ""impossibly"" silly motorcycle chase. Which as it turns out, actually was stolen from another empty Australian waste-land flick from about 20 years ago! -- Mel Gibson's, ""Mad Max: Road Warrior.""Yet, even that brief chase in the Aussie Outback was only good for 15 minutes of ""wake-you-up!"" -- and even IT, occurred WAY TOO LATE in a hopelessly boring film.This movie will have you sitting on the edge of your seats --- and ready at any moment to lunge for the emergency Exit.Why?Okay! So what, if there's NO plot, NO drama, NO comedy!. Nothing much of anything, really, for us to care about.But, that's okay! Right?Of course it is! Why? Because you just shelled out $8.00 to see: The ""Tom Cruise-A-Thon"".In this movie we get to watch endlessly, as Tom Cruise plays himself -- 'Tom Cruise' -- as he stares down beautiful women, hoping they will go to bed with him, Tom Cruise! And why shouldn't they? Why?? Because it's Tom Cruise ! That's why!!And what's the secret? How DOES Tom Cruise stare at beautiful women and make them magically WANT to go to bed with him?' (Sh-h-h-h ! It's a secret.... But here it is!!! As demonstrated in this movie! Tom Cruise simply makes sexy ""Tom Cruise"" style stares, through the dancing legs of very fast flamenco dancers -- and he does it without blinking!That's it ! We know this method works, and, apparently it works every time! Because is a scene or two later we next get to see Tom Cruise in bed with another young woman who simply could not resist the stare of Tom Cruise!But wait, there's more!In this movie we get to see Tom Cruise in several different roles.First, we have Tom Cruise playing who else? Tom Cruise! Tom Cruise rides around in a new black sportscar, speeding along on lonely mountain roads. Why? Because Tom Cruise has finally FOUND his cell phone, and now Tom Cruise wants to make prank phone calls to the girl in the next car! They spin out of control, of course. But, the near-death experience of it all is just too much for them. So, this leads naturally to ... uh, well to the bedroom, of course! After all, he IS Tom Cruise! And this IS ""The Tom Cruise Show"" isn't it?Next, we see Tom Cruise, mournfully gooning into the camera, just as Tom Cruise learns part of Tom Cruise's REALLY impossible mission is. Tom Cruise is to tell the girl -- the same girl Tom Cruise just finished having casual anonymous sex with the night before --[ that if SHE should decide to accept it ], that Tom Cruise needs her to go to bed with one of her former boyfriends!(Deep Huh?) She does it of course! Why Because she has seen Tom Cruise's stare, and has even been in bed with, well, Tom Cruise! Need we say more?Heavy, Huh?But, wait!! It all works out okay! Why?Because it just so happens that THIS ex-boyfriend of hers just ALSO happens to like to dress up like Tom Cruise, to wear Tom Cruise masks, and even likes to go out-of-doors, fooling people into believing that he's the REAL Tom Cruise ! [ Hey! Just like the REAL Tom Cruise ! ]Meanwhile, back at the ranch ....We learn that the 'REAL?"" Tom Cruise"" (oxymoron?) is pacing back and forth in the midst of Australian Outback, waiting for the director, or writers, or the mysterious black helicopter to please come back and to tell him (and the audience!!) what the rest of the movie is about, because we doesn't have a CLUE!!!!!! And what's more, Tom Cruise has just told the audience that they may have to stay in the theater until Tom Cruise finds out what's really going on!!!! (He REALLY says that folks!!!!!!)Then some people in the audience started wondering out loud, ""But, why doesn't somebody just knock off Tom Cruise??? That way, they don't have to finish writing the script for this move! We don't have to stay in the theater anymore, and the remainder of its hostages can all go home! ""This mindless drool goes on and on, with the rest of the ENTIRE movie.The camera drags us (some of us are kicking and screaming by now!) from dumb scene to dumb scene, always into situations invented just so the bad guys can provide Tom Cruise (the producer!) opportunities to cameo Tom Cruise (the star!) !!!!!But, who cares? That's okay! Afterall, it's ""The Tom Cruise Show"" isn't it?We see Tom Cruise playing the Good Guy! We see Tom Cruise, pretending to be a bad guy, pretending to be the good guy. We even get see Tom Cruise pretending to be a bad guy, who is really Tom Cruise the good guy, pretending to be Tom Cruise, the bad guy! Follow that? Who cares?We even have to see Tom Cruise trying his best to look, act, fight, shoot, like ...... Keanu Reeves!! (Fooled ya, huh! ) Well, the audience wasn't.The high-tech stunts were obviously added AFTER someone had already seen the ""Matrix"" 30-times. The ""Cruise"" even embarrassingly wears the same long leather coat, with the same dark shades, strolls around in the same big bad building, to have the same shoot-em-up scene, with the same bunch of all-bad rent-a-cops, using the very same 50 guns Keanu Reeves left in the long-coat.!!!!!!)And STILL there is NO plot anywhere on the screen ! B-E-L-I-E-V-E me!But by now, its an hour and a half into the movie, so no one in the audience cares anymore!But the makers of this movie ruined all the suspense -- and told us what the plot was, anyway!FINALLY, after an hour and a half into this mindless movie, FINALLY we are told what the heck. this stupid movie is all about, and what is supposedly going on! Are you ready? :Plot: The bad guys killed a good chemist in order to get his cure for a very bad disease, which they want to spread around Sydney Australia -- just to see what it will do to their company's stock options! ( I kid you NOT! They actually said that to us with a straight face!)Tom! Tom! Baby! Booba-la!You've had FOUR YEARS to come up with something better. To come up with ANYTHING! But this, Tom?It looks like you tried to write the script by cramming for it the night before the movie's national release!!!Other than that you let your hair grow longer -- to look more like Keanu Reeves in ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure!"" (which I might add had a much better storyline!) What happened here, Tommy boy?NO suspense! NO ""Mission Impossible"" trademark teamwork! NO camaraderie ! NO snappy dialog! Nothing! Nothing but 'Been-there! Seen-that!"" clips from last summer's movies!The only thing ""MISSION IMPOSSIBLE"" about this movie was expecting the audience to sit all the way through it!I am embarrassed to admit that I was one of the few who made it all the way thru! Too stunned to get to my feet and make my way to the exit!So trust me, you folks who left after the first half-hour. You didn't miss a thing!!!By the end of this movie most of the audience's smart money was wagered on the bad guy! Most of us figured he was our best hope that someone --- PLEASE! anyone ! -- would kill off the Tom Cruise character, and put the remaining audience out of its misery!In the last scene (which incredibly is a fist fight that drags on, without relief, for 15-minutes!), Tom Cruise and the bad guy, do every tired and leftover flying kick stunt --- deleted in the final cut of ""The Matrix,"" but included in EVERY Jackie Chan movie ever made!At some point someone in the theater should have stood up and rallied us all to march across the multiplex theater to where they were showing ""Shang-Hai Noon!"" At least that movie honestly wanted to be a comedy!!!!!If you are reading this, and STILL feel you simply MUST see this time-waster of a movie -- ( just because you've wondered what all the hoopla is about). Trust me! I have seen this movie! By the time the movie is over, you will have left the theater, and you will know no more about why this film needed to be made, than you did before you went in. In fact, you too will feel so cheated you may even demand your money back! Or, exiting the theater you will probably hide your face, sneak out the back door, and run for your car -- to avoid the embarrassment of being spotted coming out of this awful film!![ And Tom, I 'm serious, man, Okay? I ain't foolin' with ya, neither! I STILL want my refund! It's $8.00 bucks! You better know I mean it! ]But, for anyone else who just cannot possibly get out of a promise to go see this dismal failure of movie, perhaps there's a suggestion for you in this very cryptic message:""Good evening Mr. and Ms. Theater-Goer. Mission Impossible 2 is a Bust!, a Bomb! A complete disaster! We apologize but have to start the movie now. Again, we do apologize! You have only 15 seconds left to put on your very darkest sunglasses! This is an especially terrible film, so just try to sit back, and make yourself as comfortable as you possibly can. Try to relax -- But, Please try not to snore. In doing so you may inadvertently awaken some of the other theater-patrons, who may be more successful at trying to sleep all the way thru this truly terrible, terrible film.While the awful movie runs about 2 and a half hours too long, please remember also that every bit of this film is very, very boring. So, as an added precaution, and for your own well-being the theater management strongly urges all patrons, that while this movie is playing, for your added safety, until the house lights come up: Please! Keep your 'Eyes Wide Shut!'Thank you! And enjoy your nap! This message will self-destruct in five seconds. Good Luck!""(""And yes! Regis, That's my FINAL answer!"" )",Mission - Impossible II
1014,walkabout-,Just a standard action flick.,6,25 May 2000,There is nothing outstanding about this movie. Tom Cruise is a humorless and mildly charming Joe Cool lead and the plot and special effects are just plain average.

1015,AFRO PUFF,"Good overall, but something's missing...",8,3 June 2000,"No doubt that this is a good movie.  The script is a bit too predictable.  It needed more plot twists and surprises. Action was great, but most action sequences ended prematurely.  If you are a fan of John Woo, you can tell that the action was toned down to get a PG-13 rating.  Rumor has it that Woo and Cruise both loved the original cut, but it would have received an R rating.  Around twenty minutes of violence was cut out.  Those twenty minutes would have been pure bliss for a John Woo fan!  Hopefully that original version will resurface on the DVD (hint...hint... if they didn't make the DVD yet).  Great movie otherwise, but the possibilty of the full version leaves a person unsatisfied with the theaterical release.",Mission - Impossible II

Although the amazing stunts with all the nice high tech equipment [and Tom Cruise's muscles] kept me quite entertained throughout the movie, the plots twists proved too much for something that's supposed to be a fun and entertaining movie.  I fear that if I would take my 11 year old brother to see it, he would be asked me questions the whole time.  But I have to admit, the helicopters, fast cars, and the motorcycles combined with the high tech villain [a deadly virus that that bad guy threatens to unleash in downtown Sydney] were pretty impressive.  Alas, I was told by a lab rat friend of mine [as in, someone who works in a lab at a university] that most injection guns do not come in shiny chrome.  But Tom Cruise, Dougray Scott, and Thandie Newton all do nice jobs of playing...well, who they are supposed to play.  And one last comment...isn't it sad that we're running out of villains?

I enjoyed the original, but thought the combination of the Matrix SFX team and John Woo would be a true event not to be missed.It was a shame then, that the film I so wanted to succeed, tripped and fell on it's face. I cannot believe that a film can get through a test screening with such cheesiness, unoriginality and downright shoddy attention to detail polluting the cinema. The film has it's good points - it's refreshing to see a film where computers are not the incredible tool they are in most blockbusters (Independence day). But the ridiculousness of some situations and the cheeeeeeeesiness made me want to scream! The whole dove in the doorway thing, the completely pointless over the top fights. I know Woo is famous for his KungFu, but there is a time and a place... Was I the only one to notice the tires on the bikes change at least twice? Slicks and massive offroaders look slightly different. And please explain how a truck laden with 5 men with heavy weapons can easily catch a single man on a superbike.

But the point is: Despite that, it's a lot of fun to watch. Choreographed action-scenes, minutely set in scene are John Woo's handwriting, and he continues the use of dramatic slow-motion sequences within them, as seen in ""Face/Off"". Some slow-motion combat scenes somewhat reminded me of ""The Matrix"", but they are not just a mere plagiarism. Tom Cruise is at his best as action-hero, but the storyline is unconvincing, and the storytelling is slow and tired in the middle segment of the movie. Writers Moore/Braga are miles away from their peak performances. Nonetheless, M:I-2 seen as a whole, is better than the first part. For those of you who noticed: composer Hans Zimmer doesn't use his motive from ""The Rock"" in this score. Rating: 7 of 10.",Mission - Impossible II

(jaboo)",5,29 May 2000,"the setting: first showing monday morning 5/29/00 and the theater was half full at best. that made it the perfect environment, you can stretch out and relax. i went into this theater with out the influence of critics, also.
from the opening scenes to the credits i saw something that has become quite typical of movies lately. shall i say computer enhanced stunts/action sequences. you know the ones that im talking about, they just dont look natural... which leaves the scene feeling somewhat empty and not believable.and since there where many scenes of this nature in the film it left the whole film feeling somewhat empty. also the background music didnt flow together, so every time it changed you noticed. almost at level of being distracting.the biggest laugh of the movie i got was the motorcycles that magically changing tires from smooth street tires to the dirt bike style, and then to have the camera focusing on them. i personally expected more out of WOO. none the less the film was entertaining, i didnt leave screaming and i can appreciate what cruise did for the film, actually seeing the actors face in the action/stunt sequences where nice.

However, the type of movie-goer who watches and says repeatedly the hackneyed ""that could never happen"" will be disgusted.  The Impossible part of the title is there for a reason, expect some unreality.If you love explosions, gun fights, and fist fights, you will be pleased.  I was.  The plot is so-so, enough to keep you interested but nothing like the first movie.  This is quite a departure from M:I one.The bottom line?

The camera work was very glossed over and made the movie like plastic. This is an action movie that should shame anybody who had anything to do with it. Some Scenes were so cheesy i couldn't help but laugh at it's insincerity. This was a complete waste of time.

How do you make a violent movie boring ?  Yes it looked like Tom was climbing rock walls and kicking butt but I didn't care...I just didn't care.  And could we have MORE shooting ?

1027,mr_jones,"Good Tom Cruise flick, bad Mission: Impossible movie",5,25 May 2000,"I loved the original Mission: Impossible TV show, and was somewhat impressed by the first movie, but this movie goes too far:  it takes all of the elements of M:I the show and makes them secondary to Tom Cruise's performance.Take The Matrix's karate/gunfight scenes, James Bond's gadgets, and mix them with a dash of the original M:I movie, and you have the formula for M:I2. The only problem is, is also manages to carry over some of the worst parts of all of those movies: an overacting male lead who wears black and spouts cliches, a tag-along woman to love and leave, and a convoluted plot that is as difficult to watch as it is to explain.Anthony Hopkins reminds me more of ""M"" from James Bond then of Jim Phelps. Instead of giving orders, he seems to be making suggestions...  Ving Rhames does a lot of sitting, and the new Australian agent doesn't seem to make that much of an impact besides a little comic relief now and then.All in all, you may like this movie if you're a fan of Tom Cruise or want to see a *decent* action movie, but if you're looking for the trademark Mission: Impossible ""undetectable spies"" and ""intricate plan"" elements, you're better off staying home and catching reruns of the original series.",Mission - Impossible II

This movie's special f/x were impressive the first time around but lost something in the second, third and fourth viewings you see it.

The original Mission impossible movie was great and had a very good plot. It was surprise after surprise that led to a surprise ending.  M:I 2 though had no surprises and the plot was easy to guess.  It traded off the suspense and surprise of mission impossible for action and hard to believe motorcycle stunts. Overall it turned out to be a mix of a James bond movie Bond a Karate movie. With a greatly over used story. I would recommend this movie to action fans, but fans of the first M:I movie will be disappointed.",Mission - Impossible II
1032,bcredsox,Best Woo movie - One of the best action movies,9,26 May 2000,"MI-2 is a very complete, classic-formula action movie. But aside from the action, the rest of the movie was just as enjoyable. Woo makes the most ordinary situation a stylish work of art. I saw this in SDDS, and 15 minutes into the film those losers turned the surround sound off because the next theater was complaining about the noise. So, with NO surrounds, it was still good, even though I'm getting my money back. The actors were WELL CHOSEN.  Everyone in the movie had strong presence, especially Dougray Scott. I loved this movie. It was a simple, romantic, stylish, action film. And the action.... well... it stands with the best.  The situations with ""the masks"" in this one are original, tense, and VERY WELL DONE, I can see why Woo did this film.  This is one stylish movie, one of my favorites.MI-2 is pretty much a ""superhero film."" And Tom Cruise is made out to look very badass. MI-2 is surreal, over-the-top, and at times ridiculous.  But that's what people want to see on the screen.  And that's why this is one of the most enjoyable films I've ever seen.  This IS Hollywood, and it's the way it SHOULD be.",Mission - Impossible II
1033,logovisual,Seriously disappointing,6,24 May 2000,"I made the mistake of expecting MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2 to be fun and smart. As it turned out, it was neither. Sure, the action sequences are great, but the plot and script are God-awful, the characters shallow and uncompelling, and the film as a whole is just... boring, even with the thirty non-stop minutes of action at its climax. Robert Towne (the screenwriter) has managed to turn the M:I franchise from sleek, cerebral spy thrillers to second-rate James Bond ripoffs. Almost every minute of this film comes off like a bootleg print of any terrible Bond flick; Hunt has, apparently, become a ridiculously soft-hearted sex machine; female characters exist to have one quote-un-quote ""strong"" characteristic while simultaneously enslaving themselves to a dominant male; and when the action sequences come around, there's no suspense whatsoever, because the idiocy of the plot which provided for them has stunned you into a comatose stupor. I really, really wanted to like this movie, but it simply gave me no reasons to.",Mission - Impossible II
1034,andrewyn,Thank Goodness for the Fast Forward button,1,18 December 2000,"I'm glad I didn't pay the $25 it costs for a night at the movies to see this one.  And even the $4 video rental was too much.   I love action flicks, with the chase scenes and all the other elements found in them.  But this movie just didn't work for me.  It was too 'forced', with every single cliche in the book thrown in for good measure.  And of course, the requisite Matrix-type fight scene had to be included.  (Deuce Bigelow had it also, but it worked in that movie).It is understood that you have to suspend some beliefs when you see a film, especially of this genre.  But this one required the suspension of any reality and some basic laws of physics, while we're at it.  Heck, even the XMen was a more believable film.With interminably boring chase & fight scenes, this movie really dragged at some points. And there was enough slow-motion that I thought it was a series of TV commercials for various e-businesses.Plot-none.  Dialogue-my 8 yr old could have done it.  Sets/locations-James Bond continues to rule supreme in this area.   All in all, a very disappointing movie.  How did it do so well at the box office?  I don't know, maybe there was nothing else showing when this came out.If you like the smirky looks on Cruise's face, then this movie is for you. If not, then rent something else.",Mission - Impossible II
1035,fmanna,It wants to be The Matrix,3,24 May 2000,"When I saw the second sequence in which Tom Cruise, as Ethan Hunt, climbs cliffs in Arizona and leaps between them like Spiderman, I figured ""hmm, this must be like one of those high tech holo-deck training thingies they must have in the IMF now."" I was wrong. For some reason the audience is supposed to believe that these acrobatics can be performed by any human. And thus continues the movie.This film was directed by John Woo, which was a great choice for the action sequences. Unfortunately, the movie itself didn't have much action in it until the middle of the movie, and the romance sequences between Newton and Cruise were very hollow and trite. The slow motion was overused, and the film was debilitated by the actors' tendency to overact to make up for an extremely weak script. The only shining moment in the acting department was Anthony Hopkins, who delivered his lines with good humor and life.The team aspect of the Mission:Impossible series seemed totally lost. It seems Ving Rhames was only brought in for a few laughs and to be the guy sitting in the truck, while the other member of the team was the guy who flew the helicopter, while Cruise's Hunt was the superhero who scaled cliffs, did backflips, and flipped motorcycles while immolating the bad guys.In conclusion, the movie seemed like a bunch of amazing action sequences overlapping a script that was a combination of a trashy romance novel, a world atlas, a comic book, and a cookbook. The characters performed feats from The Matrix, such as human mid-air collisions, but M:I2 didn't pull it off because it was happening in ""real life"" not a computer simulacrum.",Mission - Impossible II

The plot was most definitely simpler than the first one. in comparison to MI, the story here was easy to follow and it really was quite a boring premise.I have to admit, the action was good.

Not only is it the only non R(or equivalant rating) rated action movie woo has made but it looks deliberate.  The gun fights suffer constantly from the cut away before you see blood technique. It annoyed me greatly and I dont see the need to make a movie with this much shooting pg-13 to begin with.  If you are a big woo fan this will surely disappoint.  The shots are amazing and the stunts are great.  Its just over all it was way too tame.  The story is also very predictable.,Mission - Impossible II

Having seen other John Woo movies, I was ready for some fancy gun play. I was surprised to see what I believe was a sort of love story trying to thicken the plot. Love stories are cool don't get me wrong, but they aint so hot when you wanna see some guy do somersaults while mowing down his enemies with a pistol in each hand. I have to say though that I was surprised that the romantic aspect didn't really detract from the movie. Tom Cruise was great nice energy, he makes the part very likable. Another thing that made me very happy was the use of all the IMF's little spy toys, they were quite interesting. Even without all the flashy shooting the movie had explosive action. Bombs and exploding cars were very common place throughout the film. If you want to see a great action movie this is for you, hey you can even bring the wife maybe Woo was on to something.",Mission - Impossible II

Mission Impossible's cornerstone was team work.  The team was the thing. The way they interacted and fooled the enemy.  In Mission Impossible II, as with the first, we see that Mission Impossible Team members have been turned and the outcome depends more on the ""super hero"" qualities of one team member than on the actions of the team.  The final fight scene is very much WFW stuff.  Its the kind of movie that can entertain once.  I can't see myself wanting to watch this movie again.",Mission - Impossible II

It isn't. The plot to this movie is incredibly stupid and there is no intelligence in the whole movie.

It really annoys me that the critics have bashed this film because for me the main reason for going to the cinema is to be entertained and if you are like me then you will love this film. Some critics have said that there are no gadgets in this film .....errr hello did i watch the same film as everyone else because in my opinion their were quite a few of those trademark M.I.gadgets. They also say that not much happens in the middle of the film.Again i have to disagree because they are expanding the storyline between Tom Cruise and the female lead.Also more is learned about the deadly virus and the effects it could cause. I don`t know about you but i thought this was pretty standard of most films,its called expanding the story. So finally if you are one of those people who nitpicks and says things like....""ah man that would not happen in real life"" then watch something else. Or if you`re like me and love to sit back and enjoy a visual tour de force of stunning filmmaking then watch Mission Impossible 2,I know i will be.",Mission - Impossible II
1043,morden1399,What was impossible about this movie?,5,27 May 2000,"Well, the ending was exciting. That was about the only thing a person can say about the otherwise dull ""Mission: Impossible 2."" John Woo does an admirable job, and Tom Cruise does a good job with his new set of martial arts moves, but otherwise this is a rather vapid film. In comparison to the original, which had far too much plot, this time around there's far too little.At no point in this film is there any sense of mystery, of deception. It's straight-forward, bubble-gum entertainment, wrapped around a marketable star and a director who really only gets to show his stuff in the last third of the film.The movie also suffers from a dreadful lack of character development, with Ving Rhames being woefully underused. Similarly, the Australian pilot who's also part of Ethan's team is introduced and then... well, he faded so fast from the plot that I can't even remember the character's name.The action towards the end is quite entertaining, but it's too contained at the end of the film. It almost manages to save this movie... but not quite. ""Gladiator"" still reigns as the top summer action movie, at least until ""The Patriot"" and ""X-Men"" show up in July. ""M:I-2's"" biggest highlight is the soundtrack, and that's not saying too much. Go see it for a matinee, but skip the full price.",Mission - Impossible II

1045,trotolo,Predictable and simpleminded,3,31 May 2000,"I saw this film with great expectation. John Woo is known for excellent action sequences and there were some of these, but why did they all have to be in slow motion? It is not as action packed if everything is slowed down. Also it could have been an hour and a half if everything was at normal speed.  It looked like he had seen The Matrix too many times.As for the story, it was a very simple plot and you always knew who the bad guy was, even when he was wearing a mask. I really enjoyed the twists in the first one. The use of the flashback was exceptional there. Other camera angles you didn't catch were made clear later. In this one, I could have gone to sleep for an hour and woken up at the end to have entire sequences replayed for me in flashback. I truly think this movie was made on the 3rd grade level so that no one would miss anything or have any excuse to see it again (bad for business). It was all an excuse for Tom Cruise to show off (the stunts he did were pretty impressive). More Luther is needed in the next sequel, which I am sure there will be.

What I did expect was an excellent John Woo action movie and I didn't get it.  From the ridiculous plot to the inane dialogue this movie never came close to the quality of Woo's other films.  A well trained monkey could see every ""plot twist"" coming a mile away.  The action sequences, while occasionally impressive, were so over the top the entire audience groaned. Unlike other Woo action films, there is absolutely no introduction to the characters and, frankly, you couldn't care less what happens to any of them.

Even other people in the theater on the way out were saying the same thing. And even if the ending is exciting, it is a little bit over the top. ""Oh, Come On!"" was a phrase shouted frequently. And the final showdown between Tom Cruise and Doughray Scott didn't have as much excitement or intensity as did say the final Commudus/Maximus fight at the end of Gladiator.

There was a terrific, intelligent, plot that delivered suspense and plenty of action.  The 2nd installment, however, was over the top from the 1st scene.If you thought it was a little unbelievable how Cruise was blown from the helicopter to the train at the end of the 1st movie, then expect nothing less than that [in almost every scene] in the sequel.  The effects became so absurd, that I had to listen to everyone around me laughing the whole movie.  And I hate, I mean hate, to hear people talk or laugh during a ""serious"" part of the movie.I also did not appreciate the actress, Thandie Newton, who played Cruise's lover.  She made the same face during the whole movie...truly an untalented actress.  The face that she made was a cross between pouty and sexy, with her eyes always fixed.  It really got old after a while--almost a little comical after seeing the same expression for so long. But for some reason, the stone cold Ethan Hunt from the 1st movie was chasing her like a Mad-man during the duration of the MI:2.  Essentially, she drives most of the plot.  I couldn't buy into their intense spontaneous love and neither did most people in the theater.On a positive note, however, the action in the flick was visually stunning.  I truly have no idea how Woo shot most of the scenes.  Woo over did himself.In essence, the movie seriously lacked a plausible plot. The heroine couldn't act--she could only make a single (perhaps even goofy) facial expression.  And the action scenes were so spectacular, that they were unbelievable. The movie is clearly not a spy movie, but a demonstration of the latest special effects and jaw dropping action scenes.  Please don't be prepared to think, or you will be severely disappointed.6/10",Mission - Impossible II

Woo can do more with fewer words than any director I know, and in Cruise, Scott, and Newton, much of his cast do a marvelous job of acting without having to speak. Not that the script itself is anything shabby - cute, at times witty. Good for more than enough chuckles.This movie has cool, it has style, and what's more, there's an actual heart to it. Cruise's Hunt suffers - there is doubt in what he's doing, and a lack of faith that portrays itself much more in what he doesn't say, and how he doesn't, than what he does.

But then it's on for young and old as Woo lets loose for a solid 45 minutes of non-stop action, involving gun-play, motorcycle chases, explosions, hand to hand combat and, of course, Woo's trademark doves.The first hour of M:I2 is a little slow, with a sub-plot trying to build a romance between Cruise and Newton and the masks featured in the 1996 original are back in abundance and are overused, often confusing the viewer as to what is actually going on. Whenever there's a plot twist that needs to be explained either Cruise or Scott just put on a mask. IMF is only briefly referred to at the beginning and even though Ethan Hunt has their full support he still seems to be on his own. Even with a screenplay from Robert (Chinatown) Towne, poor plotting is the biggest downfall of M:I2.If you can get past this you can really enjoy yourself. No one does action better than Woo and although Rhames is pretty much wasted, Scott makes an interesting villian, and Cruise is an athletic and charismatic hero, and you really appreciate it when you see that it is actually Cruise doing the majority of his own stunts.But the real star here is Sydney and even though there are too many establishing shots of the Opera House and the harbour bridge it looks beautiful. A great advertisement for Australia as a holiday and film making location.Although not the best of the summer blockbusters(Gladiator is leading the pack so far) M:I2 is very enjoyable and definately worth the price of admission.4 out of 5.",Mission - Impossible II

A very good performance in what might be her breakout picture.Also, although I am not a big fan of Tom Cruise, I have enjoyed both of his MI performances.  This one perhaps more than the first, solely due to the obvious influence of director John Woo.  In the first movie, Ethan Hunt was played as more intellectual and planning.  This movie, Ethan Hunt shows a purely physical side, displaying a fighting style somewhat reminiscent of the late Brandon Lee.Directed by action master John Woo, this movie is naturally studded with eye-popping stunts.  From the free-form mountain climbing in the opening credits to the astonishing motorcycle acrobatics in the climatic chase scenes, one hardly has a moment to draw a decent breath, much less get more popcorn.  A real roller coaster of a movie that, somehow, still manages a good plot line and oddly believable characters.The only possible complaint I could muster was an overuse of slow motion and stop-time photography ... but this is a very slim complaint at best.Spend the money to see this one first run, then go back when it hits the dollar theaters in a few months and enjoy it again.",Mission - Impossible II

Tom Cruise shines again as the ever popular Ethan Hunt.  The movie shows off the acting bravado of both Cruise and Ving Rhames (Luther Stickell from the original) as they combine with near-matrix quality effects.The fight scenes are stunning and, surprising to many, the plot follows in the footsteps of the original.  It has action with a story, which you don't see often in a sequel.  If you enjoyed Mission Impossible, you will be thrilled with the latest installment.This is indeed - going to be another year ruled by special effects.  Just when you thought acting was the prime concern of the movie-going public, you see Hollywood's iron man in fight scenes and death defying action sequences that will make your head spin!Tom Cruise and John Woo have teamed up to create the summer blockbuster.

The action never stops and the story assumes the same high standards as Mission Impossible and builds from there.Tom Cruise indeed does rule Hollywood and this movie will show you why. It keeps you on your toes, though at times very predictable,  it never lets up on the action.  His new leading lady, Thandie Newton, could have been a 'bond-girl'.  She is stunning throughout the film and never let Tom steal a scene (which is deserving of mention alone).If you enjoyed the action of Mission Impossible you will enjoy this.  The beautiful cities of Seville and Sydney host the majority of the movie but the highlight has to be the special effects and the captivation of the cast.I hate to compare the fight scenes to those of the matrix but the similarities are obvious.  The motorcycle scene that you have seen on the commercial is but one scene that pushes the envelope of reality.  Although some of the sequences may be computer enhanced, it is also obvious that the choreography was exceptional.  Not to mention the fact that Mr. Cruise has done a little training.Right from the second scene, you will be on the edge of your seat as Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) hangs from the edge of a cliff.  The suspense, action, and special effects will well make this movie worth a trip to the big-screen.",Mission - Impossible II

It the kind of movie where people of the world would be offended that Cruise and Wagner would even accept a script of that pathetic caliber.  I've seen monkeys write better than that, seriously.  Any ways when I walked away I was truly offended and I almost yelled, ""I'm mad as Hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!!""Or something like that.",Mission - Impossible II

I'll sum up like this:-there is only 1 woman in the movie who immediately sleeps with the main character and then acts stupid and dependent for the rest of the movie. Overkill on the close ups of her big eyes, and sweet innocent-yet-sexy look.-the predictibility was so bad I laughed. Like the gun laying at Cruise's feet, in the sand right when he needs it. They also overdid it with the switching people with masks tricks.-I like other Woo films, but there was a lot of shooting, death and violence in this one. I prefer martial arts to guns.-Cruise looked like he was on an ego trip the whole movie.-no character development, an OK plot, mostly just a hard core action film.Should've seen the new Woody Allen film instead.",Mission - Impossible II

However, this movie was blatantly obligatory without showing anything new.  Tom Cruise looks like a moronic hippy.  His martial arts moves and other physically impossible moves made me think I was watching The Matrix all over again.  The sad thing is, this movie wants you to believe it is possible.  The leading lady is quite hot, but there is not even any nudity.  The villain is laughable, and the audience got a huge chuckle when he demanded ""Stock. Stock options to be precise.""  While John Woo is known for his excessive use of slow-motion shots, it grew quite annoying as I was waiting for something to happen. From the commercials, I made the decision not to see this movie, and I'm glad my initial instincts were correct.  But since I got the chance to see it for free, I thought I would go.

It's nothing more than a weak Tom Cruise vehicle.  Other ""team members"" are barely a support cast.  There's none of the cleverly timed interaction that defines Mission Impossible.  To make things worse, the first 100 minutes of the movie is nothing other than a series of boring dragged-out implausibilities.  Woo expects us to be entertained by over-milked eye-candy.

Maybe that's why I'm a little disappointed in it.  I thought it was a really good movie.  But, I think they spent too much time on the ""love story"" instead of focusing on what drew me into the movie. I was looking forward to the spy tricks and stunts that the first one had. There weren't any real twists to the plot.  After the opening sequence, I kept looking for someone to pull of their mask.  Still, it was a good movie. It just could have been better.",Mission - Impossible II

Almost all the required elements to make this a box office success. Some detractors argue about the excessive use of slow motion, which was a resource used by John Woo to emphasize the action scenes (and also to help Mr. Cruise a bit with his kicking abilities).

My biggest problem with this film is the way it is edited.  It is so quick that as soon as something eyecatching comes onto the  screen it is replaced by something else in less than ONE SECOND! Woo's trademark shootouts do not make it past the PG-13 rating.  Did anyone even get shot?  All I saw was Tom Cruise firing round after round and a couple of people lying on the floor after the fact.  This is worse than his 2 TV movies and it stinks of studio/MPAA interference.The romantic aspects of the film are sappy at best.  The notion of love at first carcrash is absolutely ludicrous.  The religous icons, doves, and gregorian chants have no business being in this film.  Cruise is playing a spy , not Joan of Arc.",Mission - Impossible II

Nothing made sense.  No chemistry between Cruise and the girl.  The trademark John Woo shots were so John Woo that everyone in the theater was laughing.  I'd skip this film.

1082,prlis,"not very good, watch out for spoilers in this post!!!",3,27 May 2000,"Well okay, let me start off by saying that this movie did have its good points, even one moment of genious.  But the rest sucked!  Warning spoilers throughout so be wary if you haven't seen the movie!Okay, all the slow motion stuff was bad.  I mean its cool if you use it now and then for the really cool stuff, but not ALL THE TIME!  Like in the begining when he jumps from the cliff, that was cool.  But I dont need to see it in slow motion evertime he does a little flip that's not really even that complicated.  I swear, virtually every stunt he did was in slow mo, and most of them weren't that complicated, we don't need to see everything slowed down just to see Cruises hair fly all over the place.Story:  Story not that good, love story didn't even develop, there might be a lot of missing footage from that.  Bad guy not that bad, rather flat actually.  I was actually bored for at least 45 minutes while the story ""developed"" which it really didn't.Action:  Now since this was John Woo I thought the action scenes would be great, but they weren't.  They sucked.  The motorcycle chase has its moments of coolness, but also its moments of obsurdity.  Like when Cruise and the villain jump off their bikes and hit each other and fall off the cliff, how dumb was that.  People were laughing because that belongs in a cartoon. And why, in the biotech building, when he was supposed to be hurrying, why was Cruise slowly walking everywhere?  And it wasn't slow motion, he was just walking dramatically slow, and right before he can destroy the last of the virus he pauses for like thirty seconds thinking.  That was sooooooo dumb. The mask thing was cool at first, but they did it so often at first that it got confusing, I really think there was a lot of cuts made to this movie, cause things didn't seem right.  The last time they did the mask switching was cool, that was the moment of genious in the film, but every other time they did it it was dumb. It was okay, worth watching on video definently, but not really spending ten bucks to go see it in the theators.",Mission - Impossible II
1083,hoawak,Very Good,10,27 May 2000,"I saw MI-2 with five other friends last night, and I must say this is a very good film overall.  Looking at the user voting stats, a lot of people voted this movie somewhere between a 7 and 8.  And this is approximately where I would put this movie by John Woo.  Although I see a wide range of opinions on this board, from the stats I think most people agree that MI-2 is superior to the original.  Most of the criticism, I think, comes from expecting this movie to follow the original MI mix of 60% intrigue and 40% action.  MI-2 is just the opposite: 60% action and 40% intrigue.  And the action may be a little too hard-hitting and over the top for some fans. What surprised me, however, was Tom Cruise's athleticism onscreen-  (Keanu Reeves was good in 'The Matrix', but he looked stiff as a board!)  Four years ago, I saw the premier of MI at the Virgin Theaters in downtown NY, and at the end of the movie, I could see the question marks over everybody's heads.  What did we just watch?

Usually there's at least one or two swerves that takes you by surprise; but not here.  The action isn't really that great until the final half hour.Other little annoyances from the movie would be the obsession with slow motion photography.  I mean this movie would have been a half hour shorter if it was shot entirely at normal speed.  Woo is also intent on shooting that chick from every possible angle during the first half hour to 45 minutes.I would'nt go out of my way to see this movie if I were you.

This poor excuse for a sequel fell short in almost every category.  The plot was weak, and the ""mission"" seemed far from impossible. Most of the intrigue and suspense you would expect as a fan of the TV show or even the first movie were taken out in favour of sequence after sequence of Tom Cruise performing WWF-style acrobatics in slow motion.  The supporting characters were pushed so far into the background as to make them inconsequential, instead, more Cruise back-flips and more things blowing up.  If it's ""Mission Impossible"" you are after, stay home.  This was more like a Van Damme show-off piece than an ode to a once-great premise.",Mission - Impossible II
1086,Skreeman,Mission: Predictable,4,30 May 2000,"Boy, what a disappointment. I expected so much more from a potential blockbuster. The plot concept for the mission is good. But the movie breaks down from there. The movie was directed by John Woo. Director of ""Face/Off"", John Travolta and Nicholas Cage. ""Hard Target"", Van Damme, ""Broken Arrow"", Travolta and Christian Slater. This movie was so bad that I considered walking out and waiting for my friends in the lobby. A lot of the sentiment is way to action movie cliche. There is no real intrigue that you would expect from a deep cover spy movie. There is about five minutes of character development, and those five minutes were laughable. In fact, the whole movie theater did laugh. In fact, there was a lot of laughing during the movie. The rest of the movie was a heavy visual effect movie. Not like Star Wars visual effects, rather just a lot of ""eye candy"". It was a lot of unbelievable stunts, car chases and martial arts fighting. From that respect it had a bit of a ""Matrix"" feel to it. But even The Matrix had better plot and character development. Don't go see this movie and expect to see anything like that last one. Some of the characters are the same. Tom Cruise is Ethan Hunt and Ving Rhames returns as Luther Stickle. But this movie is all about Ethan Hunt. Rhames' character is very minor, and is nothing more than a snapshot of the Luther that we first met in the train car in the first movie, not the man he had become by the end. He's all attitude and one liners. Anthony Hopkins, who plays Hunt's boss is only in the movie very briefly, and even he is nothing but attitude. I guess that's how I would sum up this movie: attitude and fighting. But that's it. The characters in the movie are two dimensional puppets that Woo uses to show some cool fight scenes. I wouldn't really recommend the movie at all, but if you want to see it, wait for the $1.50.",Mission - Impossible II

However, I did not expect the dialog to be so bad that that half the audience (including me) would be laughing at the corniness of it all.  The slow-mo editing was cool in the Matrix, where they were supposed to have some no-so-human abilities, but here it just lifted the un-realistic and cheesy factor.

I mean, come ON! I mean totally unbelievable that they pulled this one. Does this mean when the Charlie's Angels movie comes out we get to see Charlie?OK, lots of action, but there is only ONE reason to bother seeing this movie and it's to feast your eyes on Thandie Newton... but that alone is worth the price of admission!For the rest, well, the John Woo fight and chase scenes are just fine, if typical of him (lots of slo-mo visual poetry - there wasn't a single action piece without a slo-mo section in it somewhere) but nothing compared to The Matrix, and I have heard it being likened to it. The story is rubbish, nasty virii movies have been done already - it's totally Tom vs the baddies, this is in no way a team of people outfoxing the bad guys as in the original series. Sure there are a couple of players around, Ving Rhames is the computer guy, and then someone it seems they picked up off the street cos he was australian and could fly a helicopter, but they basically just sit around watching Tom do the work. The only active team member (the lovely to look at but annoyingly English accented Thandie), who is supposed to be a world-class thief and ""I don't take sh*t from anybody"" person, and she starts out that way, is reduced to ""oh god help me I'm only a female and I love you Tom please rescue me"".",Mission - Impossible II

1090,shadow_fist,Good John Woo movie. Excellent action. Cool plot.,8,31 May 2000,"My friend and I used to watch an hour of Mission: Impossible every day after school and after this movie we both agree that it is more of a ""Mission: Impossible"" movie than the first.The action is quite good,  not quite as good as The Matrix but it definately has the same feel. The movie features lots of The Matrix style Ultra-SLO-MOs and gunfight sequences.The music is more heavy metal in nature than the original movie but still has the Mission: Impossible ""feel"" to it. The music fits into the style of the movie perfectly.As far as the plot goes it is a lot like a James Bond movie with more sneaky stuff like what was common in Mission: Impossible. If you have watched as much Mission: Impossible as I have, you may find the plot to be somewhat predictable, but the average movie-goer will find it full of of twists and turns.I give it an 8, because I loved the original series, and no movie has yet done the series justice. On the other hand, Mission: Impossible 2 is an incredible movie, and deserves a high ranking. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves Mission: Impossible, James Bond, The Matrix, John Woo, or twisting plots.",Mission - Impossible II

Being a huge fan of John Woo films, this one really hits the mark.  Sure the plot is simple but John Woo makes a great movie by not following the first one where nobody can understand the plot even if it existed at all?  But what more do you want....its a fun movie, Tom Cruise is trying to save the world, lets keep it simple and not try to continue ruin the franchise by making it like the first one.  Sure, this won't top his Hong Kong flicks such masterpieces like Hard-Boiled and The Killer.  However, I would put this movie right up there with Face/Off.  Face/Off has a great story and great action and it really introduced John Woo to the world.  However with M:I2, the John Woo trademarks really stood out with his stylish slow motion effects to capture all its action in its intensity.  Tom Cruise never looked better.  When you work with John Woo, he turns you into a hero....an action hero! Everything is great about this movie.  The right amount of action, it was so good that you just don't want it to end.  Most people might think that the John Woo trademarks are slightly over done, but some may find it very cool and stylish.  No director is the same.  Everybody has got their own style. This is a must see for the summer and a great way to start off the summer. This movie will no doubtedly pass the 100 million mark in less than 2 weeks.......quite amazing I must say!   M:I2 is a masterpiece and a milestone in film making.  Many people groan at the style of this John Woo film but its only because they don't know how to appreciate quality and original film-making.  Thats why its labeled a John Woo film.  This is for sure a film that critics will bash, but that only means its going to be a great movie.  You see, many people are just WAY TOO critical about movies, thats why they have problems enjoying movies.  Word of advice to the people who don't think they'll enjoy this movie or didn't enjoy it......watch the first M:I movie, you'll like the second one even more.  Its all there, user-friendly plot (easy to understand),  breath-taking stunts, great camera work, stylish film-making, ultra cool action sequences, Tom Cruise never looked so cool.

MI2 is one of the best action movies I have ever seen, director John Woo is of course THE action-movie director of all time, and if this movie doesn't prove that, nothing will. The perfectly timed slow motion shots that are Woo's trademark add greatly to the overall movie experience and the camerawork is simply outstanding.Besides John Woo, the second insurance for top-class filming is leading actor Tom Cruise. His acting in this movie is in one word superb. His character, Ethan Hunt, is a pro, he's cool, he's sensitive and definitely unstoppable...who said James Bond was the action hero of all times? Better hope that there will be no successor to MI2 if good ol' James wants to keepthat title, Ethan Hunt is a serious competitor. Ving Rhames returns in this movie as Hunt's computer-expert just like in MI1, and Rhames somehow adds something to every movie he has played in lately. A surprise to me was Anthony Hopkins co-starring in this movie as Hunt's boss, pretty neat, Hopkins rules :) and his no1 quote for this movie would have been description enough!""This is not mission: difficult Mr.Hunt, this is mission: impossible, mission: difficult should be a walk in the park for you.""In short: this movie is a must-see for every action movie fan, and try to remember when you walk out the theatre, don't kill the first suspicious guy you see...it's a movie!",Mission - Impossible II
1094,dvalenz,"Sit back and enjoy the ride! Great fights, great explosions, and insane stunts alone puts M:I-2 in my all-time Top 10",9,31 May 2000,"If you love action flicks then this is a must-see for you. M:I-2 is a nonstop ride that had everything I love in a movie- a hot chick, gratuitous violence, high speed car chases, high speed motorcycle chases, crashing and burning, matrix-style fights, lots of explosions and gunfire, insane stunts involving rock climbing and base jumping to name a couple, and great shots of my home-town Sydney.If you can suspend your disbelief for a couple of hours then go and see this flick. Tom Cruise and Dougray Scott both excel in their lead roles as the hero and villain.The plot may not be as elaborate as the first one, some might argue that there is not even a plot at all! Anyway the stunts, fights scenes and explosions alone put this film into my top ten, up there with the Die Hard trilogy, Lethal Weapon series, and the 90s 007 flicks.This is the first movie where I've enjoyed the sequel more than the original.",Mission - Impossible II
1095,ynot-6,Entertaining...yet perhaps lacking originality,6,31 May 2000,"This movie was truly an entertaining one - or at least to a point. However, I found the story line being a cut-and-paste from other action movies, especially from:Goldeneye - colleague turned bad, steals something very dangerous. Hero uses girl and together they tackle the baddy.Even though they weren't exactly the same, similarities were very evident. Anyway, it was definitely worth watching for the action sequences and stunts - even though some of them, towards the end especially, were a bit tongue-in-cheek.Well done Tom for doing your own stunts - or so I heard.Go watch it, its good fun.",Mission - Impossible II
1096,phatpat114,Much better than the sequel...a very good movie...,7,1 June 2000,"Mission Impossible is a very good movie, and is very well done. The movie opens with the villain in disguise as Ethan Hunt, (Tom Cruise), where they hijack a plane and steal a man's briefcase with a top secret virus in it. Then you see Ethan Hunt on a 2,000 foot cliff, and he makes it to the top, without a stunt double (entertainment weekly). In comparison to the first one, the sequel was much better. The beginning is a love story, and it is a lot like something out of a Hitchcock flick. The plot is as follows: Ethan Hunt must steal a deadly German virus from the villain, Sean Ambrose. They also create an cure for the virus, and they plan to corner the hospitals/market and force them to pay them millions of dollars for the cure. The action is great, and the plot is fairly easy to follow, unlike the first one. a very good ending, too. There was one problem, and that is the fact that the movie went a little heavy on masks and disguises, and occasionally, it was too predictable. Other than that, John Woo has created a great flick. Go see it!",Mission - Impossible II
1097,RoninF5,Impossibly stupid! Spoilers to follow.,1,1 June 2000,"I would warn those reading of spoilers but if you've seen the trailers for MI:2 you've already seen the whole movie. I couldn't believe it was over when Tom (big surprise) offed the bad guy. I was still waiting to see something - anything - I hadn't already seen.  Every single action shot - every motorcycle trick, every explosion, every slow-motion kick, was in the trailer. The problem for the promotion department is that there is nothing else in this movie. It is a void. The story is extremely derivative - every Hollywood cliche dumped into a sausage press and lethargically cranked out. To say that the characters are cardboard would be an exaggeration - cardboard is at least a quarter inch deep. No motivations, no interaction, no good dialog - I think there were two lines that was supposed to be funny. I wasn't expecting Shakespeare but I expected a lot more from John Woo. The were only two - TWO!?! - un exciting,  un original, and very short action sequences separated by interminable exposition. (As opposed to John Woo's Hardboiled of which the final third was one long, wild and amazing shootout that takes place in a hospital full of patients and new born babies. Now that's original!) Hollywood can produce films with good characters and exciting action like Gladiator and make a ton of money so why do they continue to make horrendous trash like MI:2?",Mission - Impossible II
1098,rafael.pujals-2,"does not live up to the first, big disappointment",6,1 June 2000,"Many people say that MI:I was too complex and convoluted. Well, this is Mission Impossible here, people - I enjoyed not knowing what the hell was really going on until the second viewing. It left you guessing. This sequel, while high on style, lacks any substance whatsoever. Don't get me wrong - it's not a bad movie, but it did disappoint me. I mean, I was actually bored for the first half of the movie! And while this may be a good stand-alone film, it lacks any continuity to the De Palma orginal whatsoever. In first, sure Hunt was athletic, but he basically just ran and used a gun. In the last 4 years, he became a martial arts expert?? They could have worked in a line about that or *something*. But we are just to assume that repeated watchings of the matrix will turn you into Jet Li I guess. Finally, given that this is a john woo movie, I was let down on how little action there actually was. I may buy the dvd, but only for the last 15 minutes. Last complaint -- what was with the totally inappropriate pop music during the rock climbing sequence?? It totally ruined it for me. And Ving Rhames -- another wasted outing. Just add it to the growing list. My ratings for the 2 movies: MI:I -- an 8. M:I 2 -- a 5. Let's just hope that M:I 3 is more like the original than the sequel.",Mission - Impossible II

It has action moves that I've never seen before and a woman that hushes the audience.  If you want a sophisticated plot with maximum realisticness (which is pretty rare in any movie these days) go see something else.

The only reason I didn't was because I thought the movie was so bad, it had to improve. Now I suppose I can do the rest of the population who haven't seen this movie a small service by begging you PLEASE not to waste your time and money by seeing this overrated, predictable, completely unbelievable, plotless piece of boredom. {I haven't seen Mission: Impossible, by the way.} The plot of mi2 seemed to be 'Tom Cruise must get valuable thingy back, falling in lust with pouty chick and doing far too many drawn out action scenes while he's at it.' Some more reasons I hated it are: the absolute lack of intended comic relief {you can groan at the absolute lack of reality in the action scenes, though}; and the fact that it was so damn loud! {That could be blamed on the cinema I saw it at, though.}I got two things out of this movie: 1, hours of exclaiming over all the flaws and wishing I could get my money back, 2, when you feel like walking out, walk out!",Mission - Impossible II
1102,movieman-207,I was disappointed.,4,6 June 2000,"I really enjoyed MI-I and am a long-time Cruise fan, but MI-II did not live up to the standard set by either the original television show or the first Mission Impossible movie for three reasons.  First, there were too many dead spots with no action at all.  Second, while the slow-motion fighting was interesting enough, it was unoriginal.  It reminded me of The Matrix but not as well done.  Third, I expect to see the ""rip the latex mask off, I'm not who you thought I was"" stunt somewhere in a Mission Impossible film, but not once every few minutes.",Mission - Impossible II
1103,hanswee,WORST movie I've seen in a while. Not worth paying money for,1,7 June 2000,"Logic wise the plot is stupid.  John Woo is an idiot if he approved this wanna-be screenplay.  The good guy does not kill the bad guy when he has the chance multiple times.  Some stunts are so dumb.  I mean the only reason they did some of the stunts was because they were stunts, no other reason. They detracted from the pathetic excuse for a story and made the whole movie seem dumb because they were unnecessary",Mission - Impossible II

1105,junkmail-9,I put the GRRRR in SWINGER baby!,1,12 June 2000,"Where to begin? There aren't enough cliches for filmmakers to rip off it seems. Tom Cruise plays the dashing spy with a knack for bagging the ladies (a la Austin Powers, hence my summary), of course, and the fate of the free world rests on his *very* self confident abilities to put a stop to some capitalist pharmaceutical pigs who have taken their profession to the next step: create your own market by introducing a pandemic and make *millions* (picture Dr evil holding his pinky up.) The arch nemesis, Douggie Scott, who IMHO looks waaay too much like Tom Cruise to begin with (in the all too predictable and stereotypical final showdown slap fight at the end, it was difficult to tell who was who), and I'm not kidding when I say this, actually gets it into his head that 'why make millions when we can make...billions?' After Austin Powers, how can anybody put out a film like this? The doe-eyed damsel who sleeps with Tom Cruise roughly 5-10 minutes after meeting him (movie time) disappears inexplicably from the plot towards the end when she is 'dumped in the middle of a crowded city' about which Douggie says 'the more crowded the better' all the while, dollar signs lighting up in his eyes, either from the paycheck he'll get from this flaming bag of dog crap movie, or from his new set of stock options at Evil Co, Inc. which are going to shoot through the roof when the big bad virus (a virus which they grow in a Petri Dish, mind you) starts ravaging the Universe. Somewhere along the line Anthony Hopkins shows up and helps Jodie Foster find the alien message at the Seti listening station or something. This movie shouts 'I wanna be the Matrix!' and 'I wanna be the Phantom Menace!' as the endless slowmotion action takes bore you to death with very loud and very overly dramatic choir-type music blaring madly at the most inappropriate times. The numerous ludicrous action sequences with Tom Cruise's sweaty and 'finely toned' physique will make you want to do nothing short of vomit as he bares his sunken chest at you. In short, wait until it becomes a tv movie, don't pay money. You'll only encourage them. Treat hollywood like an unruly child: when it holds its breath, just ignore it and it'll pass out. What lesson have we learned today? There is something more pathetic than an aging hipster: an aging heartthrob.",Mission - Impossible II

This is a high-energy, gadget laden amusement park thrill ride, and a jolly good one it is too.  The music is superb, the special effects are breath-taking - especially the opening sequence.  The plot is about as deep as a Scotsman's pockets and as predictable as Old Faithful but hey, its stylishly directed and an excellent way to be simply entertained in an adrenaline-centric sort of way for a couple of hours.  Make sure you see it at a good theatre with thunderous sound and a huge screen.  Call me shallow, but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.",Mission - Impossible II

About the movie the story sucks, the script is not good enough and it gets really annoying to watch this bull***t story which you 've already seen in other films. Tom Cruise is nice, i would love to see for example Jean Reno again, not the bad guy who doesn't seem to be so bad at all. Anthony Hopkins is the role i loved, although he played for some minutes. Ving Rhames is the third role i liked, the second is Thandie's Newton character, herself is nice actor but not so great, i think she has a great and very bright future. i don't recommend it if you really want to take a good look of mission impossible can do see the first part but if you want to see action and chaos see it.

I would suggest that if your male under twenty you will probably love this movie.I found that, as I was watching this movie I was getting more and more annoyed about spending the $8.00ea on the tickets to see it. Special effects are great but I grow weary of the same stuff time and time again.And at the end of the day all this movie was, was special effects. T.C. can be an amazing actor why would he lower himself to this script. Then it hit me... Real Life Cartoon. That's all this movie is. Kind of like the Road Runner and Coyote. Let's face it, this movie was so ridiculous what else can you consider it, but cartoonish. And Tom made a great Roadrunner character. I'm sure all of the actors had a lot of fun playing real life cartoon characters. When I viewed it with this thought process, I wasn't nearly as annoyed at spending my money.

1110,sshoning,Vastly disappointing....,2,17 June 2000,"I was hesitant to see this film because I've hated every John Woo movie I've seen (Face/Off, Broken Arrow, etc).  His over-the-top-macho, stunts-where-none-are-needed, laughably-silly movie making style does not entertain me at all - I find it really annoying.I should have trusted my instincts.The first M:I was not a great movie, but I enjoyed De Palma's plot twists and supporting performances by Ving Rhames, Jean Reno, Henry Czerny, and Jon Voight.In M:I2, I thought Cruise was good - he always is - but he had no help. There are no good supporting performances in M:I2.* Dougray Scott's villain looked about as menacing as Michael J. Fox.* Thandie Newton's blank, seductive stare got old in about 5 minutes.* Anthony Hopkins was not in enough scenes to make an impact in the film.* Ving Rhames' great character from the first M:I was totally watered down and rendered irrelevant.This movie is all about visual imagery and stunts - I'd even say they had Cruise grow his hair a bit longer just so it would ""look cool"" when he performed his aerial, somersaulting drop kicks in the fight scenes.  Such shallow film making doesn't cut it in my book.If you don't care about plot or acting, you'll probably love this movie - I was surrounded by people in the theater who seemed to enjoy it.But, if you're among the few ""cursed"" with intelligence like me, and more discerning and picky about what entertains you, don't waste your time. Instead, go see a real movie - like the re-release of Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"".  In theaters now.Rating:  2 out of 10",Mission - Impossible II

She is a very talented actress.  Ving Rhames is great and so is Anthony Hopkins. I can't believe the negative  reviews of this film.  It is a film that allows you to simply have fun.

1113,mikey-147,Expression of Absolute Disappointment,2,25 June 2000,"The first Mission Impossible movie was a smart, interesting, well-crafted look into the IMF through the magic of the movie camera for the first time. It excelled where TV had failed - with edge-of-the-seat suspense, with special effects that only cinema can provide, and a plotline that would never have passed a TV network's damning gaze (It was NOT an impossible plot to follow - only innovatively twisted and required, originally, thought to understand.)Of course, I was looking forward to the sequel, and I finally saw it yesterday. Wow, what an utter disaster of a movie that was crafted this time around. First of all, this has no sense of continuity to the first movie or the TV series - there is no Impossible Mission team, no smart Impossible Mission, really, and no sense of suspense that drew people to the Impossible Mission series in the first place. This is Broken Arrow II, if you like, but not IM. The promise of the first IM's last scene, when you realise that Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is going to be the head of his IMF team, is thrown out the window.Instead, we've got an action-shmacktion here-is-the-plotline-laid-out-so-my-four-year-old-son-can-follow-it-look-out -Ethan! plot that ruins the movie (hence the suspense dies very quickly after the first grappling scene). We've got a case of Matrixitis, as if John Woo spent a few too many nights watching the Matrix after 12 hour shoots in the Australian desert and decided to have Ethan Hunt ""know kung-fu"". We've got ridiculous, over-the-top explosions and under-the-covers romantic undertones that seem forced and uninspired. We've got a female lead that starts out strong and spends the last hour and a half of the movie whimpering and annoying and weak (their depiction!)How unfortunate this movie tried to be so much, when we would have been happy with the real Mission: Impossible II.

The rumors on the internet telling me that the movie had no real story or plot didn't frighten me. Hay, it is Mission Impossible, Tom Cruise doesn't want to ruin his childhood series, he will make sure that John Woo will compensate the story with a lot of action. But 'o my god' what did they do? Anthony Hopkins in MI2 for 4 minutes, changing masks all the time (about 30 times), multiple loose ends, John Woo's doves flying all over the place but now John Woo sees it as art and leaves the film for what it is. Nice shots from dancers and horse riders are stretched for minutes, what a bore... What happened to the original series style? There was no humor in the movie; when Ving Rhames asked Tom how the situation was on the island Tom said 'Risky'. Why didn't he say 'Risky business'? That would be a nice inside joke! But hey, another perfectly genre waisted. Please don't give us a Mission Impossible 3 i will watch some reruns of the series and play part 1 from time to time.

That`s the (very simple) plot of ""M:I-2"". It is better than the first part, but I expected much more of John  Woo. There was just one of his famous shoot-outs, plus a a car-race, a karate-fight, the freeclimbing-scene and the motorbike-chase. Nearly every action-scene appeared in the last forty minutes. The other time there was the spy-story (thrilled a bit) and the boring lovestory between Tom Cruise and Thandie Newton as jewel-thief Nyah Hall. Boring because the characters Hunt and Hall were unbelievebable flat. Hunt was just a James Bond without irony, Hall was too weak and uncaring for a tough jewel-thief. A very clear sign of the flat characters and the James-Bond-influence is the scene, when Hunt and Hall met for the first time. They lie on each other in house Nyah just broke in (so no guard can see them of course). This scene could appear in every 007-adventure. Why the movie isn`t bad? The last forty minutes.

I heard before going in ""park your brain outside for this one"". All in all this was true, the plot was weak and the characters fairly two-dimensional. But this was not the reason to see the movie, no-one was going to be expecting ""Citizen Kane"". For a movie like this the main point is the action.MI2 was typical John Woo, taking many of the sequences from ""Hard-Boiled"", it was a visual spectacle of the highest order.

Think about a real actor, playing someone like that-you can't get better than that.  I think that although scenes, like the balcony scene with Cruise and Newton, and the race Track and most of the whole premesis-made this movie out to be an updated action version of Hitchcock's ""Notorious"", I still think this was an awesome movie, with great action, and a good story-that will start a trend in artsy action pictures.

John Woo (the director) did a wonderfull job of accomplishing what he does best - giving us more and more action. He likes to film things slow mode (so i've heard) and maybe it's because he doesn't wants us to miss it if we blink. He has proven himself to be a great action director in this movie and in his previous Hit movie ""Face/Off"". Though the action shown is not always realistic it's always fun to watch. And even if u don't like it u just have to ask yourself ""how did he do it???"" This movie was good - if you like PURE ACTION and don't mind that it's un-realistic at times (most of the times). The main charecter that was played great by Tom cruise (who also did the stunts by himself including the first scene with the mountain climbing). He jumps, bounces, shoots, hits, and showing us how brilliant he is (both charachter and actor).Of course - like evry movie this one have it's down-sizes. I.E: the plot is a lot similar to other action movies. Someone steals a mass destruction weapon and uses it to get money.Been there - Done that! And sure - the action parts are clearly unrealistic and people who like realistic films will leave this one with a little sense of disappointment.But still - Great directing from John Woo and great acting from Tom Cruise and his co-actress.

First of this movie contains many stunts performed by tom cruise.  the story is much easier to under stand than in the first movie. But some of the scenes are straight out of THE MATRIX. also the end of the film gets kind of weird when tom cruise is seen with a dove that flies around and just confuses people. also there is a large number of mask in this movie which makes in a little predictable. otherwise this is an all right movie and if you liked it you will be glad to hear that M:I-3 is up on the drawing board.",Mission - Impossible II

They were the typical action scenes of any of the John Woo's movies, but exaggerated to the limit and with a not-so-athletic Tom Cruise. And what to say about the gun-in-the-sand final scene?

1131,Stuart Turner,"Fantastic, Best film of the year so far",10,13 December 2000,"The problem as I see with most of the negative comments about this film are that people try to pick holes and think too hard about a film which at the end of the day is straight forward action flick,Now I've had my whinge lets get to the positive points, John Woo never ceases to amaze me, he took the action movie to the next level with Face/Off, MI2 takes it further with some of the most breathtaking action scenes and camera work the industry has seen. At times the action becomes almost a ballet of violence with Cruise dancing between bullets and explosions whilst dispatching the bad guys without a second glance, the stunts are great in particular the motorbike chase scene and the firefight at the Biocyte H.Q.  The acting although not stretching for the likes of Cruise and Rhames suites the film perfectly with both of them turning in solid performances. On the same note Dougray Scott was born for the part of Sean Ambrose the evil former I.M agent, and credit must also go to Thandie Newton for turning what could have easily been a stereotypical damsel in distress role in to something a little special.In short well done John Woo ( who sees things other directors wouldn't dream of ) well done Tom Cruise ( for doing most of his own stunts and making the film so watchable ) and well done Paramount Pictures ( for having the guts to commision the second film after such an ordinary first one)A special mention must go to the quality of this film on its DVD release. I saw the film at the cinema in the summer and bought it on the day of release on DVD earlier this week, the extras on the disc make the film even more enjoyable and is well worth £17. A final note for all budding directors, the action film has been redefined again, I'd like to see you do better !!Face/Off 2 or MI3 anyone !!",Mission - Impossible II

It's not that I don't like that kind of movie, but it is just not the sort of thing you expect from a movie like that. The makers of ""M:I-2"" learned of that, and gives the audience now a terrific ride which you just have to see!I heard a lot of different reactions of this movie, and I found out that you hate this movie or love it.I don't know why there are persons who hate this movie, because I absolutely loved it! It really has everything you can expect from this kind of movie. It has humor, romance, action and a lot of absolutely spectaculair stunts performed by Tom Cruise himself.This movie also has an outstanding score by Hans Zimmer who also did before the fantastic music and songs of ""The Prince of Egypt"" and the great score of ""The Rock"".Plus the great performance of Thandie Newton and a great Dougray Scott (from ""Ever After"") as the villain.This movie is also from the beginning to the end visually fantastic.

I would rent this although I own it, i regret it. I think I'll note not to see MI:III in theaters. This movie proves it once and for all, SLOWMO HAS TO GO IN ACTION MOVIES. I've had to watch the movie at least 10 times to get all the facts. Three action sequels that are terrible, MI:II,Matrix (the first one was great), and any new bond movie.

Jhon Woo makes it again and V. Rhames, the helicopter guy and John C. McLoy give a great performance. In some way it is similar to The Bourne Identity, Die Hard and Lethal Weapon.

1139,bigyutes,Mission Impossible 2 a disgrace to the entire franchise,3,2 July 2006,"Mission Impossible 2 is anything but a spy movie, which is what the whole Mission: Impossible story is supposed to be based off of. The first movie installment of the series contained a very complicated plot that, although was highly criticized, forced the viewer to keep his attention glued to the movie. Mission Impossible 2, however, lacks any type of believable story. There are significant plot holes thruout the film, including the scene towards the end of the film when Tom Cruise puts a mask of himself on the face of the second-main villain. Where did that mask come from? Furthermore, where did he get a mask of the villain from to place on his own head? A significant plot hole that symbolizes the unbelievably poor storyline to begin with. This movie has close to NO resemblance of the original ""spy"" story that Mission Impossible became so loved for. Rather, it is simply a John Woo-directed action movie that happens to star Tom Cruise and contains ridiculously unrealistic action sequences and MAJOR plot holes. Anyone that actually paid money to see this film wasted both their money and the time it took to watch the film. It was VERY disappointing for die hard fans of the first Mission Impossible movie, which had a greatly written storyline, and were expecting the same solid story from the second movie. This movie is a disgrace to the Mission Impossible franchise and I am shocked that they went ahead and made a third installment. M: i III, however, made up for M:i 2's dismal performance and then some.",Mission - Impossible II

The character of Ethan is totally changed. He's a cocky, arrogant, pretty-boy idiot. John Woo is a moron and his choreography is absolute trash. A 3-year-old with 2 Barbie dolls could make a better fight scene than Woo. The acting was so terrible that it made my eyes bleed. The plot was MORONIC. Who in the hell wants to release a deadly virus for stock options? I mean what the hell? And, honestly, why were there so many pointless parts to that movie? Everything that Ethan did seemed superfluous. It was so utterly corny that I had to laugh. If you watch it as a parody, it's fine. But as a serious action movie? It's not worth a rental.

But it is a sequel to Mission: Impossible, so that alone is unfair, and in its own way it does compliment the original.The real problem with the film is that the plot, although quite well developed and effective, is too similar to the first Mission: Impossible and too predictable. I saw Mission: Impossible and Mission: Impossible II in reverse order, so for me the plot was new, and when I saw the first installment later, I was a little disappointed. To me, that says that the film itself is not that flawed, but its downfall is in the fact that it is a sequel, and everyone had seen it already.However, its a fun film to watch, although its not very relaxing as you have to keep watching carefully right from the beginning so as not to miss the plot. The stunts arent bad, and Tom Cruise, Dougray Scott and Ving Rhames are all on top form. Thandie Newton doesnt convince me.The verdict is dont go out of your way to avoid this film, but dont go too far out of your way to see it.

As the villain Dougray Scott was able to make you hate him! the presence of Ving Rhames is definitely added huge value to the success of the movie. John Woo has just given us another reason to remember him as the greatest action movie director ever. One simply just can't afford to miss it. the only drawback of this movie is the lead female actor. Director should've been think of it more carefully. the plot is simple but strong enough to make u tighten in the seat. the story stands as the IMF agent has given another mission which is seemingly impossible. he has to bring the deadly virus from the villain and which is appeared to be quite impossible to get. the twist appears when Newman pushed the virus within her vein. so Ethan actually got two target to be attained. one, save the world from the abusers of the virus and second, save her loved one from the sure-death as the virus will kill her within hours.

Then seeing Cruise as a soviet general in cartoon quality disguise, pretty much cinched it -this was going to be painful. And it was. Just one ridiculous, incoherent situation after another.

Doves flying in the middle of a fight, repeated slow-mo abuse, boring gun battles, the list goes on. Gladly it seems that Woo has slowed down production of his action set pieces referred to as films.

These are all trained sys/mercenaries. how can someone believe that a person can simply put on a mask and expect every one to not notice its a mask? i mean really! these things take hours to apply (We hear all the time about the hours actors take to get into character suits and masks.) and we are expected to believe Ethan Hunt can walk around the corner slip on a mask and then walk back into the room and everyone believes he is someone else? it makes my head hurt thinking about it.,Mission - Impossible II

1161,AdamOmega,Uber awesomeness.,8,13 January 2006,"I find it absolutely baffling how anyone could honestly find M:I-2 to be an awful film. One of my fondest memories of going to the movies was seeing this film back in 2000; it was a satisfying action film. This time around we saw Ethan Hunt as a man who really knew the ropes; his willingness to take risks (evident in the opening rock-climb sequence) showed contrast compared to the Ethan Hunt we knew from the first movie. I thought Dougray Scott was also awesome as Sean Ambrose, who was nearly a match for Ethan Hunt and always had really slick screen presence. The action scenes were totally engaging, and it felt awesome to watch them (emphasis on the motorcycle chase sequence), even if some of the stunts seemed impossible (#1 - Emphasis on Impossible. #2 - Isn't that why we go to the movies???). I know lots of people say there is not much of a plot, but I couldn't agree with that. I thought that the story around the Chimera virus was really intriguing, and it was neat seeing Brendan Gleeson involved in the whole plot line.This is a film that really should not be taken too seriously; it's great for visual entertainment, and for that I got a bang for the buck. To dislike M:I-2 is perfectly understandable; it all depends on your own tastes and preferences-- but to absolutely hate M:I-2, that's really a little extreme.Overall, M:I-2=awesome film in my books.

Isn't that sad? Hopefully, I will eventually find someone who likes it as much as I do.I grew up with this film, and I loved it as a kid. When I rewatched it a couple of years ago, I realized how crappy the plot is and how silly some of the scenes are. At first, I was a bit disappointed, since I'd always thought of it as a very good film, but then it started to amuse me. Today, I think it's a lot of fun for the same reasons for which I love the fridge scene in Indy 4.I guess the main reason why people don't like this film is because they take it too seriously. They complain about the weak plot, the lame characters and all the things that don't make sense. But the plot is irrelevant in a movie like this. John Woo handed some action scenes to screenwriter Robert Towne, and he developed a plot around them. So forget about the plot, which is just Notorious combined with De Palma's ""Deus ex machina"" masks, and instead focus on some of the hilarious, nonsensical John Woo action scenes.First of all there's the great opening with Cruise hanging from a high cliff without any ropes. And the nicely unnecessary car chase whose only purpose seems to be to destroy some expensive sports cars. Then there is the entire last act, which is a chaotic montage of unrealistic, staged action. It's just John Woo having fun with all his Hollywood gear. Firstly, you've got Tom Cruise attacking blind guards, who ought to have seen him miles away. Then he's using his motorcycle as a shield while skating the asphalt. At one point Woo has even inserted a medieval duel on motorcycles.The best thing, though, is when Ambrose pulls a ""Die Hard"" and suddenly turns out to still be alive and points a gun at our unarmed hero. Now, what do you do in that helpless situation? Of course, you notice a gun at your feet, turn around, while you kick in the sand so the gun bounces up in the air, you catch it and shoot the enemy. All done in such a fast and sudden motion that Ambrose doesn't have time to react on it. Isn't that beautiful?8/10. Even by the standards of the action genre, this film makes little sense. But then again, this franchise is called Mission Impossible, and is actually about what all action films are about: Impossibiliy made possible. It's just an incoherent mix of a lot of impossible, but funny situations.",Mission - Impossible II

After the first Mission Impossible, I have wanted to buy the sequel. We watched it last night and have already put it on a garage sale pile.I think the casting was adequate although I was hoping to see some continuity from the first movie (more than 2 characters) and possibly some recognizable star names. The plot concept was decent as well although it was rehashed via dialogue throughout the movie. These were not my issues with the movie.I had trouble following some aspects of the movie (holes) while other scenes dragged on and on. There were also intended surprises/shockers throughout the movie. However, they were so blatantly advertised that an 8-year old would see them coming. The musical score was practically a neon sign advertising them as well. They were also were used so many times that the movie looked like a one-trick pony.One other issue - martial arts. I love a good fight flick as much as anybody. However, I expect a MI movie to be more like a James Bond with secrecy and gadgets rather than like a Van Damme show.Bummer!",Mission - Impossible II

Without the positive factors featured in the original attraction, which featured a nice plot full of (though perhaps slight standard) plot twists, gadgets, computers, etc. None of that in this movie however, since Mission: Impossible II is, in contradiction with its prequel, an action-movie with little thought. The plot involves a virus and a medicine, and if you haven't fallen asleep by then, you'll probably figure everything out in the first half-hour.The movie is, as said, far more based on the ""Lights, Camera, Action, No-brain""-idea, and that action is mainly Tom Cruise basically saying: ""Look at me, I'm doin' all this impossible stuff and I'm coooool!"". And it sucks. I've seen 50ct acting less ""cool"" in his music-clips. The action is way too far over the top and that, together with the lack of a good plot and its plot twists, ensured that I was watching the movie with a feeling that was mostly based on exclamations as: ""bull, you can't do that!"", ""oooh, look at me, I'm sooooo tough"" and ""yeah yeah yeah, I don't want these James Bond like love-scenes!"".As most sequels, this certainly has to bend over for the prequel, due to the overload of ""coolness"".",Mission - Impossible II
1166,christopher-loh,Really a bad director,4,16 November 2014,"I had the chance to catch this movie on HBO and prepared a good spread of buffet to enjoy. In the end, I nearly puked. That's how bad this movie was. Seriously, John Woo please go back to Hong Kong and continue directing your B grade movies...This MI2 must be the worst of the entire series... Stupid slow motion and John Woo signature using of pigeons?! We are not living in the 80s so please improve your filming acts! I felt so sorry for Tom Cruise for accepting this role. Perhaps somewhere sometime, he felt the same way too. So many clips of this movies resembles John Woo movies in HongKong... really, stop copying your own self and think of new action moves please....",Mission - Impossible II
1167,olofleth,The plot - the same as in Notorious (1946),3,13 December 2005,"Has anybody else noticed? A lot of references are being made to the 1946 script by Ben Hecht for Alfred Hitchcock's Notorious.First of all the plot in itself is very similar, with the female spy, the Mata Hari, who has to sacrifice herself and marry the crook, so that the protagonists can get to him. Just like in Notorious, the woman in MI2 is the one who really risks her life, while the male hero is on the outside.Second of all, the whole scene at the horse racing tracks in MI2 is a more or less exact replica of the one in Notorious.If you have seen both MI2 and Notorious, you will know what I mean.I don't think that it is anything wrong at all that Robert Towne (he himself a great playwrite) copies the intrigues of the superb script by Ben Hecht. On the contrary it should be seen as a tribute to the latter. I am disappointed however that no one else (that I know of) has noticed and commented this.I also think that this is the perfect example of how modern special effects, action and all that crap, ruins the great intrigues of a brilliant screenwriter, and takes away all the excitement. This is also very obvious when you look at the results, whilst Notorious is one of the best films in the history of cinema, MI2 is a blasphemy./O",Mission - Impossible II
1168,marwinsingh-73272,....one of the best film of tom cruise........,10,4 July 2016,"It is best film of 2000 and also one of the best film of cruise. It is full action/thriller film.First film was good but not excellent because that film has got no fight scene many people complained about it so after that directors put great action sequences and fight scene in this movie.it has a great story about a secret agent.IMF's secret agent Ethan Hunt is sent on a mission to destroy ""chimera virus"" which is taken in wrong hands.This movie has a great action sequences such as slow motion hand to hand combat scenes and bike stunt scenes etc.In my view it is best film of mission impossible series.I personally gave it 10/10 rating.In my opinion you should have to watch it.I think you should have to watch the whole MI series it is one of the best action/thriller/spy series ever made. . . . At last i say watch this movie at least one for sure.....",Mission - Impossible II
1169,mcp_99,Notorious,8,28 May 2006,"I know a lot of people hate this installment, but i love it. Simply because it takes a classic movie (Notorious) and put a modern touch to it. OK so it's not Cary Grant nor is it Ingrid Bergman, but the cast works. I'm sorry we are no longer in the days of classic, instead we are in the day of making classics work for our ADHD era. MI:2 is what its meant to be a love story, a spy movie, and an action bonanza. John Woo is the king of setting up action and then executing it right on point. He also does a nice job using Flaminco dancing as a beat to a key seen. Car chases, slow motion, Motorcycles, and Greek myths, in my eye this movie put that crap they called the third one in its place. This is what a summer blockbuster is supposed to be!",Mission - Impossible II
1170,geffroy-eric,Excessive,9,7 May 2006,"If you like to watch movies without thinking to anything smart, if you like slow-motion gunfight scenes, if you like characters without any personality ; all in all, if you love to watch popcorn movies sometimes, you're gonna love M:I 2. Just don't forget to leave your brain at the entrance of the cinema.Obviously, the movie is easily criticable. First, it has nothing to do with the name ""Mission Impossible"". Howerver, it is rather an excellent action movie, absurd and definitely not realistic.But if you're tired, if you just want to see some excessive action, just watch M:I 2 with your friends. Otherwise, if you were expecting a serious, complex sequel to the first M:I, you're gonna cry.",Mission - Impossible II
