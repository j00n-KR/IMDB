0,TheLittleSongbird,Good spirited Christmas fun,7,26 November 2009,"Let me just say I liked all the Santa Clause movies in their own right. This is a decent sequel to an amiable first film, that is good spirited, fun and sweet. It is not the best Christmas movie out there, but it doesn't try to be. If the kids get past the rather thin plot, and that the script isn't always particularly groundbreaking or new, they are in for a festive for a treat, adults too. However, it has a very good message, and it is guaranteed to put a smile on your face.The soundtrack is also lovely to the ears and the look of the film is nice. I don't know about you guys, but like the first film I felt good while watching this movie, and for me that is a good thing. The performances are very good, Tim Allen as always is very likable and completely watchable. And the supporting characters like Cupid and Father Time are so cute a movie of their own would suit them perfectly.All in all, a nice movie. Not groundbreaking, but a pleasant Christmas diversion, and as far as sequels go, I personally think it's one of the better ones. 7/10 Bethany Cox",The Santa Clause 2
1,SnoopyStyle,Still has its charm,6,18 December 2013,"Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) has been Santa for awhile, but only now is he told that there is more Santa Clause. He must marry a Mrs Claus before Christmas eve. In addition, his son Charlie has landed on the Naughty List. He decides to go south and leave a substitute Santa in his place. While he falls for Charlie's principal Carol Newman (Elizabeth Mitchell), the substitute Santa stirs up trouble and puts every child on the Naughty List.This still has some of the original charm. Most of it comes from Carol slowly finding out Scott is actually Santa. Charlie's complaint about his father is less convincing. I don't think the secret is that big of a deal. It feels very fake. I rather not have an excuse for his misbehaving. There is a good lesson to be had there, but it ends rather weakly. It's a missed learning opportunity. Besides that, the movie is good family fun.",The Santa Clause 2
2,gavin6942,Better Than the Original,7,19 December 2012,"Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) has been a humble Santa Claus for nearly ten years, but it might come to an end if he does not find a Mrs. Claus.Rotten Tomatoes sums this film up as ""predictable and forgettable"". I suppose it is predictable, but not really any more than the first one. Forgettable? Maybe, maybe not. I thought the toy Santa was a great character, and bringing in Father Time and the others was a nice touch, if a bit silly.If I had any real problem with the film, it was the romance part. I understand he has a limited time to woo a woman, but to basically bribe someone into loving you, and then falling in love and getting married within a day or two? Not unheard of, but certainly not the safest foundation with which to build a future.This film comes across as even better once you have seen the third installment, which is more or less universally accepted as the worst.",The Santa Clause 2
3,jboothmillard,The Santa Clause 2,4,29 December 2010,"The first film, which gave the the leading actor his first starring role in a feature film, was a Christmas romp, but the last thing you may expect is a sequel, especially eight years later, but it happened. Basically Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) has been the new Santa Claus for the last eight years, with loyal elves, but his teenage son Charlie (Eric Lloyd) is getting himself into trouble at school and being added to the naughty list. But there are bigger problems when Santa starts to slim and lose his white beard and hair very slowly, the explanation is that the card given to him by the original Santa had another microscopic ""Clause"" he and the elves missed. He must find a Mrs. Clause before the end of Christmas Eve, he has very little magic to use to help him on his way, and if he uses it all he won't be able to get back to the North Pole, and if time runs out he is no longer Santa. Before he leaves Santa agrees with Curtis the Experimental Elf (The Cat in the Hat's Spencer Breslin) that there should someone to keep an eye on the toy workshop and elves, so with a new fangled machine, a seemingly exact copy of Santa, named Toy Santa (also Allen), is made. Returning to America, and with a little advice from ex-wife Laura (Wendy Crewson) and her new husband Dr. Neil Miller (Beverly Hills Cop's Judge Reinhold), Scott starts searching for a woman he has things in common with. As Charlie continues to be naughty in school, Scott gets the chance to talk to Principal Carol Newman (Lost's Elizabeth Mitchell), and he finds himself instantly attracted to her, so much that he asks her out. Meanwhile the new Toy Santa, starting clunky, is slowly becoming mean with his attitude to the naughty list, well, all kids in general, saying that they will all get coal this year. There is a point when Carol is made to hate Scott when he tries to convince her who she is, and with no magic left it looks like he can't go back, but he does get back and is aware of the disastrous situation. In the end Toy Santa is stopped, Carol finds out Scott is indeed Santa with beard and gut back, and he confesses that he wasn't expecting to fall in love with the woman he found for a wife, and of course in the end that is what she becomes. Also starring David Krumholtz as Bernard the head Elf, Liliana Mumy as Lucy Miller, Kevin Pollak as Cupid, Star Trek: The Next Generation's Michael Dorn as Sandman, Art LaFleur as Tooth Fairy, Aisha Tyler as Mother Nature, Jay Thomas as Easter Bunny and Peter Boyle as Father Time. The first film was better because the concept of becoming Santa was a good hook, and Allen is humorous as the sarcastic working father who has that put on his shoulders. While this film does have still have some good light kiddie humour and a reasonable love story in amongst the other less interesting subplots, it just doesn't feel the same quality as the predecessor, but a near watchable family seasonal fantasy comedy. Okay!",The Santa Clause 2
4,studioAT,The Mrs Clause,8,23 December 2010,Tim Allen returns as everyones favourite modern day Santa in The Santa Clause 2 in which he discovers he has to find a wife in order to continue to be Santa.All the elements and characters that made the first film so fantastic are back with this sequel and Allen again proves why he is such a fantastic comedic actor. As with the first film there are some tender moments with Allen and Mitchell having excellent on screen chemistry. The sleigh riding scene and the Secret Santa scenes remain my favourite scenes in movie history. It is also nice to see David Krumholtz and Judge Reinhold return after such a long break between this and the original film. I think this is what elevates this film above other sequels.I love the original and I love this sequel just as much.,The Santa Clause 2
5,Scarecrow-88,The Santa Claus 2,5,14 December 2016,"Silly, unnecessary sequel is more or less a cash grab resulting from the success of the first film. This one has Tim Allen reprising his role as Scott Calvin, who became Santa in the previous film, needing a Mrs. Claus through some sort of requirement if he wants to ride the sleigh on Christmas Eve night with the reindeer guiding him in his full form of white beard, big belly, and rumbling voice of Ho-Ho-Ho. Needing to leave the workshop of the North Pole in order to find his bride, Calvin, thanks to a genius elf boy and his ""duplicator"", he is able to create a plastic ""replacement"" to tend to matters while away. What happens, unfortunately, is that replacement Santa becomes a monster, fully dedicated to delivering coal ""to all the naughty children"" as his army of toy soldiers keep the elves in the workshop at bay. Meanwhile Scott begins to ""lose"" the Santa weight, white hair and beard, meeting a principal at his son's school (Elizabeth Mitchell) who appears at first to be quite a strict disciplinarian with little tolerance for mischief or bad behavior. While Scott tries to get through to his misunderstood son (Eric Lloyd), his good heart and charm wins over the principal who thought he wasn't considerate of her standards and a bit lacking in parenting his son acting out in ways she is concerned.A fun cast *does* encourage a smile here or there, and I did like the bit with Allen and his lone reindeer, Donner, but the premise (getting hitched in a hurry to Mitchell who finds his claims to be Santa more than a bit hard to believe) had me a bit Bah Humbug. Lots of money was thrown at this sequelyou see that in just the elaborate workshop and Plastic Allen Santa, with Spencer Breslin and David Krumholtz as elves trying to keep him restrained from turning everything upside down and inside out. Allen is almost always watchable and he gives it all he has, especially in the dual roles, getting to stretch a bit. He has good chemistry with the lovely Mitchell, too. But the plot is pencil thinit rides Allen all the way and he does try to carry this load of nonsense as far as he can on just his charisma alone. Do I think it works? For seasonal fare, it is a diversion that works about as well as something like Fred Claus. It more or less fills time and skates by on Allen's comedic skills. But the plot is all gobbledygook. Supporting cast with the likes of Judge Reinhold, Wendy Crewson, and Art LaFleur do what they can in limited roles. The first film was a nice surprise, but multiple sequels maybe were pushing it. The makeup effects on Allen weren't too shabby, going the Klumps route...in reverse!",The Santa Clause 2
6,Doylenf,Nice work by Tim Allen elevates this slightly less original sequel...,6,10 December 2010,"THE SANTA CLAUSE 2 is fortunate to have TIM ALLEN reprising his role as the gentle man who has a couple of domestic problems to solve at home before he can enter into the spirit of Christmas Eve again. One of them is his son who's having problems at school and the other is the fact that he has a very short time to find a wife. Seems he'll have to give up his Santa role for good unless (as the clause goes) he finds a woman willing to be his wife.None of the situations are able to lift this sequel into the sort of original territory that the first movie had, but at least the cast gives it all a good try. ELIZABETH MITCHELL is completely charming as the school principal who is romanced by Allen in what really is the centerpiece of the story and very well handled by both of them.JUDGE REINHOLD is on hand again, as Dr. Neil Miller along with WENDY CREWSON as his wife and ERIC LLOYD as ""Charlie."" Unfortunately, Reinhold and Crewson have little to do this time while the plot concentrates on the solution to Allen's romantic dilemma.Nice settings, plenty of holiday cheer, and an inventive plot twist involving a substitute Santa (also played effectively by Allen) combine to make this a pleasant enough family entertainment.Not quite as cleverly scripted as the original, it manages to keep the viewer interested thanks mainly to the lead performances of Allen and Mitchell.",The Santa Clause 2
7,anaconda-40658,Worthy but Hardly on Par With the First.,6,27 December 2015,"The Santa Clause 2 (2002): Dir: Michael Lembeck / Cast: Tim Allen, Elizabeth Mitchell, Spencer Breslin, Eric Lloyd, David Kromholtz: Fine plot concept with 2 symbolizing two clauses and two individuals. The idea of introducing Mrs. Clause through another clause is ideal but the playful use of violence is not. Scott Calvin's son is on the naughty list. He must find a Mrs. Clause before Christmas Eve or he will turn back to his old self. A toy Santa is created to continue his duties thus fooling the elves while Calvin quests for Earth. Unfortunately the replica Santa malfunctions and decides to follow the rules thus having coal put in stockings. Director Michael Lembeck does his best to employ as much originality as he can but fooling of the elves with a fake Santa is against character and questionable content for the intended audience. Tim Allen balances the two roles with great comic timing. Elizabeth Mitchell as a principal is obviously set to be Mrs. Claus but their sudden match up is a tad bit sudden. It is missing the courtship part. It is also a bit stereotypical that she suddenly gain weight. Spencer Breslin is amusing as an inventive elf. Eric Lloyd returns as Calvin's son but his role is not as broad. David Krumholtz again plays Bernard the elf who seems ever harassed and irritable. Great visual effects will keep themes from melting away. Score: 6 / 10",The Santa Clause 2
8,mm-39,Family Movie,7,12 November 2002,"On par with the first movie.  A Disney type movie that the whole family can view.  Parts were funny, and where did they find those old toys I played with back in the 70's.  Sappy and mellow in parts, and a Reindeer for comic relief. Worth taking the family out!  7/10",The Santa Clause 2
9,SimonJack,New Santa searches for a mate,5,8 December 2016,"""The Santa Clause 2"" holds to the long-held Hollywood axiom that sequel films seldom do as well as the first film. While there is some humor, this film picks up where the original left off, only 10 years later. Scott Calvin (played by Tim Allen) has been doing his job as the new Santa, so things are pretty much the same – except for one small matter. The ""Mrs."" clause of his ""contract"" now kicks in. So, this film's new humor is all about Santa finding a mate. There is some fun and mischief, and the film provides a few laughs. The kids may enjoy it, but there's little special or lasting about this film. It's a piece of what has become Hollywood holiday ""fodder"" in the 21st century.",The Santa Clause 2
10,namashi_1,An Entertaining Sequel!,7,26 March 2014,"A sequel to the immensely likable The Santa Clause, 'The Santa Clause 2' is An Entertaining Sequel, that works big time!'The Santa Clause 2' Synopsis: Scott Calvin has been a humble Santa Claus for nearly ten years, but it might come to an end if he doesn't find a Mrs. Claus.'The Santa Clause 2' is uncomplicated, undemanding entertainment. It delivers the right amount of fun it promises. The Screenplay is nicely written, offering sweet & cute moments almost throughout. Michael Lembeck's Direction is decent. Cinematography, Editing, Art Design & Make-Up, are appropriately done. Performance-Wise: Tim Allen is absolutely lovable as Santa. The talented actor holds your attention from start to end. Also memorable is Elizabeth Mitchell, who enacts the leading-lady, wonderfully.On the whole, 'The Santa Clause 2' is fun!",The Santa Clause 2
11,disdressed12,too dark and creepy for my tastes,5,14 December 2007,"this sequel lacks the heart and soul of the first one.it's not very funny.in fact,i found it mean spirited and depressing.it also has none of the magic of the first one.if you don't like feeling like you are being preached to,you probably won't like this movie.i also felt a bit creeped out by certain parts of it.it's much too dark to be enjoyable in the same way as the first one.i also felt it strayed into sappiness territory.actually forget strayed into.it went straight into sappiness territory.this movie also has a lot of predictability to it.it's formulaic at times.but the biggest downfall for this movie,in my opinion,is it's sombre atmosphere.i don't think it's a horrible movie,but it sure is a few steps down in quality from the original.not quite painful to watch,but not enjoyable,either.and although i may be out to lunch here,i think parents should use discretion about letting their children watch this,because it is so dark.but that's just my opinion.my vote for the Santa Clause 2 is a 5/10.",The Santa Clause 2
12,Robert_duder,"Insanely fun, heads and tails better than the first",9,24 December 2013,"The first Santa Clause movie was simple, clean, family fun. It is cute and just a really good watch. I knew I had seen the second one but its been years and what a complete delight it was to watch it again on this Christmas Eve (2013) Quadruple everything...romance, magic, fantasy, fun, family...I was simply floored. This is why sequels are so successful because it gives good film makers the opportunity to build on an already decent premise and make it better and the makers behind The Santa Clause 2 did exactly that. In many ways this film reeks (in a good way) of old fashion Disney fantasy adventures but still has that modern post 2000 feel to it as well. The characters are fun and the story is just so much more interesting and fun. I can't use that word enough...the fun factor is at least tripled in this and not to mention the love and good vibes. I almost teared up a handful of times at a Tim Allen movie for crying out loud!! The first film I couldn't truly point out my ""favourite"" most memorable moments and yet this one...dozens. The Christmas Secret Santa exchange with the teachers, the silly and very campy evil toy Santa, Comet, Chet, the romance with Carol...this is one of the best family movies out there right now. Is it a stone cold classic? Not really for whatever reason but is it a favourite of mine? Heck yes! Tim Allen returns and he is better than ever. In his stand up and sitcoms he can be a little sarcastic (which I love in those settings) but the fact that it doesn't come over into this performance at all is a big kudos to him. He is just brilliant as Scott Calvin aka Santa Clause. He truly has evolved in the character since the last one and is an old pro at being Santa. Allen is just absolutely perfect in this part. Eric Lloyd returns as Calvin's son and I am so pleased because often films like this will replace child actors but he does come back. That being said I didn't feel like he was quite as good as he was the first time around. He feels a little clumsy in the role but he's also very necessary to the story and I'd much rather have him back than a new actor. Elizabeth Mitchell joins the cast as tough as nails principal Carol. She is a great addition to the cast and her chemistry with Allen is excellent. Her transformation and ""softening"" is so great to watch and she gets the bulk of the emotional storyline. Spencer Breslin also joins the cast and by the book elf Curtis. I quite enjoy his small performance but he's very underused much like Bernard was in the first and is again in this one. David Krumholtz is terrific as Bernard and has good chemistry with Allen but he is in so few scenes. Wendy Crewson and Judge Reinhold are in one extremely small scene returning to their respective roles from the first. Liliana Mumy joins the cast as their daughter. She is adorable and also a good addition to the cast and does a good job.Director Michael Lembeck is a Disney director through and through. He has had a ton of experience in sitcoms and he clearly is very talented and passionate about telling a good story. I think its interesting he has worked on some of my favourite projects over the years so I obviously like his style. The sub-plot of the evil toy Santa who takes over the North Pole is almost unnecessary and yet it adds a certain level of adventure and gives the story its main villain without being dark or scary for really young kids. Without that sub-story then it wouldn't be quite as watchable for the young kids that might find the romance and quest part of it not as interesting. Plus the campy, funny, toy Santa just makes it simply more fun. I honestly wasn't expecting this instalment to be anywhere near as good as the first and it blew me away. I have never gotten around to seeing the third and I will be watching it very soon whether its pre-Christmas or just after because I am excited!! This is one of the best ""for everybody"" movies out there. Get it now for the family!! 9/10",The Santa Clause 2
13,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"A sad, strange little Santa.",5,25 December 2020,"After accidentally causing Santa's death, Scott Calvin inadvertently became the big man himself due to a clause in a contract he didn't know he was signing. Eight years later, he's living as Father Christmas and loving it. When a hidden ""Mrs"" clause is discovered, he's forced to return to the mortal world in order to find a wife before Christmas Eve; if he doesn't, he'll stop being Santa forever. Plus, to make matters worse, his son has found himself on the naughty list and his workshop is in danger of being turned into a fascist nightmare by the robot replacement he has left in charge. 'The Santa Clause 2 (2002)' is a step down from its predecessor, which isn't all that good to begin with. However, it certainly has its more successful moments (primarily those not concerning a plastic imposter) and it's sometimes rather entertaining in a breezy sort of way. It's nice to see most of the core cast return, too. It isn't remarkable in any real way, but I'd be lying if I said that it never made me smile. It's a fairly decent, if utterly middle-of-the-road, festive flick. 5/10",The Santa Clause 2
14,g-bodyl,Another Decent Christmas Film!,8,25 October 2010,"The Santa Clause 2 is a sequel to the original that was released eight years earlier. Most of the original cast returned to this decent sequel. I had a fun time watching this even though it's rated G. I am not a big fan of rated G movies. But since I saw the original, I decided to see this and I was pleased.Tim Allen returns as Scott Calvin. Calvin is forced to leave his position as Santa because his son was on the naughty list and it's a rule that Santa has to get married. So he goes back to his hometown and decides to fix his life and his son's.The acting is pretty good. Tim Allen and Judge Reinhold provided plenty of good laughs here.Overall, this is a great film that will bring holiday cheer to most people who see this. I rate this film 8/10.",The Santa Clause 2
15,lesleyharris30,"A Fun and Joyous Sequel that Improves from the Original,",8,28 December 2014,"The Santa Clause 2 is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a good cast.Tim Allen is back once again as Scott Calvin/Santa Claus and despite the eight year gap between this movie and the first Santa Clause,he steps right back in to this role very naturally,as if he never stopped playing him,and I think those few years gave him time to improve as an actor and do an even better job this time around,he is given a lot of emotional scenes,particularly between him and his love interest,and he shines in these parts,he's in practically every scene as he also plays the villain and it dosen't get annoying to see him constantly for most of the movie.I preferred this to the first one and I know people will disagree with me,but the original is very straight forward,in this there is a lot more adventure and there's a more joyous Christmas feel to it,I love all three Santa Clause movies as they were a big part of my childhood at Christmas time,but this one is certainly my favourite.Its obviously not perfect,but the Santa Clause 2 is entertaining and funny for the whole family and I would recommend it if you're looking for a good Christmas movie. Despite some very successful years as Santa Claus,Scott Calvin may have to give it all up unless he can find a woman to be his Mrs Claus.

I watched those two on video many times before I really got the chance to sit down and watch this movie. I guess I still suffer from the results of the ""Oh, God!"" trilogy. ""Oh, God"" was really good. ""Oh, God! You Devil"" is one of my personal favorites. However, ""Oh, God! Book ll"" is not as good. ""Book 2"" is an okay time killer but nothing more. ""Santa Clause 2"" is the opposite. It's a very funny movie and very sweet movie The bad Santa in this movie is way badder than Billy Bod Thornton's ""Bad Santa"".

Santa must now find a Mrs. to satisfy the Mrs. Clause in the Santa contract, or become de-Santa-fied.Meanwhile, there are problems back in the land of the normal humans, and Santa must, while attempting to find a wife, deal with his son's rebellious behavior, puberty, and an inane husband-in-law.There is fun to be had, but the harder you have to work to find it, the less fun one tends to have due to the work.

I found the plot to this one more consistently enjoyable, whereas the first one starts off stronger than it finishes - I'd still class the 1994 production better, but this is a solid sequel in my opinion.Tim Allen reprises his role as Scott and continues to be showpiece of the film. Elizabeth Mitchell is decent as Carol, while Spencer Breslin - who is good in 'The Cat in the Hat', and yes I like that film - fits his character well. My point being, this has a slightly improved support cast.Going back to the premise itself, it's nothing to take seriously of course but I felt suitably entertained by it.

23,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,Excellent sequel for the holiday season!,10,22 November 2005,"THE SANTA CLAUSE 2, in my opinion, is an excellent sequel for the holiday season! If you ask me, the chemistry between Scott (Tim Allen) and Carol (Elizabeth Newman) was excellent. I could feel the attraction from the moment they met. Also, Charlie's (Eric Lloyd) little capers amused me very much. In order for you to find out what he did, you'll have to see the movie for yourself. In addition, I was amazed that Scott could tell when something was up with Charlie. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, ""Tim Allen has scored huge again!""

This movie focuses on Tim Allen having to find a wife or he won't be able to stay Santa. The movie has all the same actors back, and they all do a great job, just like last time! There was a big time gap between the first and second one, 1994 to 2002, so Charlie's character has grown a good bit, he's now a teenager, that has been getting into trouble lately and is now on the naughty list 😱. This film's visuals are pretty cool to look at. And the script is pretty cute and fun. The characters are well written and work well together. Molly Shannon even makes a brief cameo, and it may just be my favorite part in the whole film, Molly does a fantastic job in her little scene, had me dying laughing! This is a cute, fun, totally family friendly Christmas movie that everyone will enjoy this Christmas! 8/10 for The Santa Clause.",The Santa Clause 2
25,aidanratesmovies,"Personally, I thought it was better than the first",8,6 December 2020,"It's charming, its sweet, its funny- many may criticize the flick for even being made- but even with its flaws- The Santa Clause 2 manages to be a magical delight to enjoy during the christmas season. Personally, I enjoyed this flick a little better than the original. It seems more consistent, and less...depressing is the only word I can come up for it. It has a relentless attitude and is fast moving, it doesn't weigh too much on the drama and things that holds it back, and instead truly focuses on the magic inside us all, especially during the holiday season. Some of you may throw up when you read that last sentence, but even though the film can be a bit corny, I find its message incredibly sweet and heartwarming. The romance between Tim Allen and Elizabeth Mitchell is quite charming, and quite adorable. Towards the end the film becomes a bit repetitive, most likely due to the writers writing themselves into a corner in order to conclude the film- but it ends ona sweet enough note to forgive it, even though it is far from perfect. In the end, The Santa Clause 2 is much sweeter than the original, a heartwarming ode to the magic of Christmas, and may even just be a better film than the first.
My Rating: 7.75/10",The Santa Clause 2
26,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,The Santa Clause 2 (2002),5,14 December 2011,"A rather forced sequel at times. I hated this on my initial viewing 8 years ago, as it spat on the memory I had of the original. This year I watched them back to back and it actually played a lot better. The film still has some major issues. Most of all, it can't balance the adult and children's views. The tone is very slapstick and childish. Bernard seems less bitter, and Breslin is boy that shouts rather than acts. He seems to try and copy the mannerisms of his favorite actors. Despite the immature tone, we have a love story which isn't all that interesting. There are some great heartwarming bits, such as the Secret Santa scene, but Allen also comes off as desperate (which his character is) and creepy sometimes. The fake Santa is a great comedic villain, and the fun Allen has with him makes up for the slow romance and seriousness he displays elsewhere. A bit disappointing, but worthwhile over Christmas.",The Santa Clause 2
27,Christmas-Reviewer,Bigger Budget and a lot less heart,5,20 December 2016,"BEWARE OF BOGUS REVIEWS. SOME REVIEWERS HAVE ONLY ONE REVIEW TO THEIR NAME. NOW WHEN ITS A POSITIVE REVIEW THAT TELLS ME THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH THE MOVIE. IF ITS A NEGATIVE REVIEW THEN THEY MIGHT HAVE A GRUDGE AGAINST THE FILM . NOW I HAVE REVIEWED OVER 200 HOLIDAY FILMS. I HAVE NO AGENDA. I AM HONEST ABOUT THEM. I loved the original ""Santa Clause"". The movie was simple and well made and had tons of heart. This sequel was made 8 years later and what the first film did correctly this film does wrong, In the original film Charlie (Santa/Scott's Son) was a sweet little boy who's on screen charm help make the original so good. In this film he is a juvenile delinquent. When Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) first took up the Santa Claus suit, and became subject to The Santa Clause. Now Santa is at the top of his game at the North Pole and could not be happier, at least until Bernard (David Krumholtz) and Curtis (Spencer Breslin), the Keeper of the Handbook of Christmas break the news that there is another clause - the ""Mrs. Clause"".As for the main plot Santa/Scott is now pressed to get married before the next Christmas Eve, or the clause will be broken and Christmas will die away. Scott must return to his home to search for a wife and set things right with Charlie. He even brings this up when visited by the Council of Legendary Figures consisting of Mother Nature (Aisha Tyler), Father Time (Peter Boyle), Cupid (Kevin Pollak), the Easter Bunny (Jay Thomas), the Tooth Fairy (Art LaFleur) and the Sandman (Michael Dorn). None of the original charm is even captured in this production. The budget is much bigger for this film but it fails to do almost anything right.If you love the first movie just watch that again and pass on this.",The Santa Clause 2
28,mike48128,Not my favorite installment of the series. A Rubber Santa Dictator?,8,13 December 2015,"It looks a little better on repeated viewing. Like SC#3, it's just not as much fun. I hope they don't make a fourth one. The phony rubber Santa-clone is mean-spirited and there is no place in this series for that. Sure, not as bad as the turn-around in SC#1, which starts out very badly with the jolly old guy slipping off the roof and an unhappy fireman at ""career day"" at school. A hidden commercial for Ideal-Hasbro ""retro"" toys. Santa-clone is made of plastic? He looks like an angry dictator from WWII? Not appropriate at all, but it will go ""over the heads"" of most kids. Kind of a ""shotgun"" wedding as Carol has to save Christmas by marrying Scott Calvin, in-a-hurry! Liliana Mumy steals the show as ""Lucy"". An uneven script. Charlie grows into an un-cute delinquent. Parts I like involve the ""Legendary Council"" (tooth fairy) and ""Comet & Chet"" the baby-talking reindeer! However, the Scott and Carol courtship seems a bit rushed. Over the ending titles, Mrs. Claus is quite chunky. Apparently she joined North Pole ""Weight Watchers"" for Clause #3. Not shown as often on TV or cable as SC#1 and SC#3 for some of these reasons? The weak ending steals shamelessly from that tacky old Laurel & Hardy ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" from the 1930's, with giant attacking clunky soldiers? (A movie that apparently most reviewers are too young to have seen?) Well, at least they didn't shoot them all down with ""pop"" guns, AK-47's or rocks! How unimaginative can you get? The Santa vs. SC fight is not fun to watch either. Even SC#3 is depressing with Martin Short as evil Jack Frost who tries to freeze up everything and turn The North Pole into a dismal version of Disneyland.",The Santa Clause 2
29,brookenichole-98054,My favorite of the franchise!,9,22 December 2020,"The Santa Clause 2 is amazing! It's beautiful, funny, charming, and exciting. With this movie, there's an action sequence and even more hilarious jokes. Tim Allen as Scott is one of his best performances, along with newcomer Elizabeth Mitchell. Their romance is sweet and doesn't feel awful for how rushed it is.
One of my all time favorite scenes in any Christmas movie was the sleigh ride to the school. All the lights and snow just really set the mood.
Another scene I loved was with Neil, Scott, Carol, Laura, and Charlie in the principals office. I laughed so hard. And the chemistry is fantastic between the family.
However, I did have one question: did anyone notice Peter Boyle was Scott's boss and then Father Time? Surprisingly, it went over my head the millions of times I've seen this movie.
Overall, one of the best Christmas movies!",The Santa Clause 2

31,Mr_Sensitive,Too Kiddish,5,12 January 2005,"As much as it is for kid, I find it to be too kiddish and pointless. The story is a little different from most Santa movie though with having to get marry and save his son and evil Santa that taking over the toy plant in the North Pole. That something different and that is good. But some stuff is just too kiddish (like for kid only), The freaky tooth fairy and tin Evil Santa and still no one can make out, kids nowadays ain't that stupid - they learn stuff from like South Park or learn it from friends.I feel there nothing much into the movie so that why I don't like it as much as other people.

On top of all that he is told that if he cannot find a wife by Christmas well then he is no longer allowed to be Santa Anymore.This is a classic film that surprisingly more entertaining than Part 1.

39,squirrel_burst,"Surprisingly fun sequel to ""The Santa Clause""",6,25 December 2014,"I'm not a big fan of ""The Santa Clause"" and in fact, I don't really think it's a good movie for a number of reasons. You would expect then, that I would dislike the sequel even more, because unless you're one of the few exceptions, sequels rarely turn out to be as good as the original. In this case, I actually think that ""The Santa Clause 2"" is a better film than the first and I think that if you liked the first one, you'll like this one too. Set a number of years after the first movie, Scott Calvin is now firmly ingrained in his position as Santa. Eric Lloyd as his son Charlie is all grown-up into a rebellious teenager (and a much better actor). The trouble comes when Santa's elves reveal to him a second, secret clause. He needs to get married. If he doesn't by December 25th, he will lose his Christmas powers. While a robotic Santa is created to keep the North Pole running, Scott has to go back to the human world in order to find a wife and straighten out his son, who is now on the ""naughty"" list.I was actually surprised to see how many of the actors came back for this second film. Actually after doing some quick research, I realized that EVERYONE is back. I didn't recognize some of the cast, like Wendy Crewson and Eric Lloyd at first, but a quick trip to the internet confirmed that yep, they're all back. Now isn't that a refresher? I half expected what I assumed was a direct-to-DVD sequel to have none of the same actors except for the odd person that needed to buy a new boat and star Tim Allen. I think this adds a level of believability to the story because the cast have good timing and chemistry between each other. As I mentioned earlier, the acting, particularly from the young performers has gotten significantly better. Looks like they took some acting classes between 1994 and 2002 and I'm always excited to see people becoming better at their craft.I like the story of this film as well. OK, it's kind of contrived at first, but once it gets moving, it's pretty creative. There are two plots going on, the first with the robot Santa running the North Pole (and yes, that goes about as well as you expect it to) and the other has Scott having to not only find a wife in 28 days (no small feat) but also looking for a way to discipline his son and get him off the ""naughty"" list. I like these stories a lot better than the plot we had in the first movie. Scott has to find a nice lady to spend the rest of his life with (and I'm not sure how long that will be, does Santa become an immortal like the elves?) and that is going to be pretty tricky. He only has until Christmas Eve, and the guy's been not only out of the dating game, but gone from the human world for some time now. His Santa powers are dwindling, which means he begins looking more presentable, but they're not quite gone so he has a bit of magic left to help ease the process of getting someone to fall in love with him (and they don't make it creepy, no worries). I like that idea, there's a lot of potential there. I thought that the lady that Scott was getting attached to was quite good too. I would assume that it's a spoiler if I list even the actresses' name here, but for the record, I thought she played a credible character and that she and Tim Allen had good chemistry going. The love plot is rushed (the movie admits it) but it really worked for me. I also liked the side plot of Charlie and his father having to connect again. Think of the scandal if Santa's own son was on the naughty list! In a smart move, that's not the bulk of the movie, it's just a side plot. That shows some forward thinking. Good job screenwriters!To me, ""The Santa Clause 2"" is better than the first one because we're used to this universe the plot is set in, the actions of the characters make more sense and it brings back everything that was good about the first movie while dropping everything that didn't work. I believed the love aspect, I thought there was just enough witty, sarcastic banter between Tim Allen and the other cast members to satisfy your itch for comedy, I even liked the reindeer and their Scooby-Doo-style talking mannerisms. Maybe my expectations were low,but this sequel comes off, to me at least, as not just a cash grab and an excuse to make more money off of a holiday-family favorite, but as a decent idea that's worth bringing to the screen. I don't think it's mind-blowing in terms of quality, but I do recommend that you see it if you have seen the first film. It actually makes me reconsider (if only a little bit) some of my criticisms of the first movie. Maybe I'll give it another shot. I say don't let your first impressions turn you away from ""The Santa Clause 2""; it's actually a fun, light, holiday movie. (Full-screen version on DVD, December 21, 2014)",The Santa Clause 2
40,stormhawk2021,Another Christmas movie more,5,25 December 2018,"It's a film that fulfills its purpose to entertain spectators without many demands one afternoon of Christmas. It's the classic children's film, but there's always the final moral for older people too, although in this case I did not think there was too much (they could have done something like that, the important thing at this time are not the gifts but that goes). Typically, the argument revolves around that Santa (popular name in Hollywood) is going to end the powers and to not run out has 27 days to get married and in the end, the man finally ends up falling in love and finally , all this with the elves in between, sledges and with the classic moral as the most important: Santa Claus exists even if the spirit is always there. If I put a passable is because you have to take into account the few demands that can face facing a film of this style, and also age, I'm sure that children between 12 and 15 the movie will seem seven stars To the rest, I am afraid that a five would be very indulgent.",The Santa Clause 2
41,Toronto85,The Santa Clause 2,6,18 December 2012,"The Santa Clause 2 takes place a number of years after the original film. The first movie saw Tim Allen's character ""Scott Calvin"" become Santa Claus after the previous Santa Claus fell off of his roof on Christmas Eve. Well in this one Scott has settled in nicely to his role as Mr. Claus, but there is one problem. He has to find a Mrs. Claus in only twenty eight days or Christmas as we know it will be over forever! On top of that major problem, another subplot includes his quest to get his son Charlie off of the naughty list. It seems Charlie has been rebellious as a teenager, spray painting school walls and such. So while Santa/Scott leaves the North Pole to take care of that business, his trusty sidekick elf Bernard and newcomer elf Curtis create a clone Santa to take over on an interim basis. Scott ends up falling for Charlie's principal Carol Newman, and with the use of magic wins over her heart. Meanwhile in the North Pole, the fake Santa that Curtis the elf created ends up becoming a power hungry dictator who believes ALL kids are bad and deserve only lumps of coal for Christmas. It's up to Scott to defeat him and save Christmas.The Santa Clause 2 is not nearly as good as the first film. While the whole idea of Santa may be absurd to many people, this film has so much more unrealistic things occur in it that it lost my interest. For example, Scott's ability to snag a wife in under a month? It's completely ridiculous but I guess had to be done to wrap up the movie very nicely. And all of the magic that he uses to make Carol fall for him goes completely unnoticed by her character, such as a mistletoe and twenty presents appearing out of nowhere. She just brushes it off. I also did not like that the major characters from the first film (Scott's ex wife Laura and her husband Neil) took a back seat in this film for the overly annoying young elf Curtis. It lost the magic and heart that the first movie had.There were some good moments in this of course. Tim Allen had some great comedic moments, especially when he ditches the Santa suit and acts like a regular person. I like him better as Scott Calvin than I do as Santa Claus. He and Carol have a good combative chemistry that turns sweet once we start to see the human side of her. And the scenes when Scott uses magic to give all the teachers toys that they loved from their childhoods really was a good piece. It just wasn't as good as the original. I thought it was ridiculous that he had to find a wife in one month. And considering that was the major obstacle in this film for the main character to overcome, I wasn't really engaged in it.Children will love this movie (I know I did years ago), and that's really all that matters with a Christmas movie. But as an adult looking for a good holiday film, this one fell flat up against others such as Home Alone 1/2, Christmas Vacation and even the first Santa Clause.6/10",The Santa Clause 2

43,travisimo,Good Christmas Fun,7,12 January 2004,"It's been quite a while since I've seen the first Santa Clause movie, but I remember being quite surprised by it.  It was a unique twist on the beloved Santa character with great comic timing by Tim Allen.  But that was a while ago, and I didn't really know what to expect from The Santa Clause 2.The movie started off kind of slow when everything is going smoothly. Everybody's happy and Santa's meeting with his fellow ""legendary figures,"" which I admit was a fairly funny scene, but this movie just started off kind of boring.  Of course this is normal with any movie until we're presented with a conflict.  Santa is reverting back to his civilian self and must find a Mrs. Clause to fulfill the contract and continue being Santa.  So to watch over the North Pole, a duplicate, plastic Santa clone is made, and slowly turns to a maniacal boss over his elves.  I thought this was pretty funny, especially with me being a business major.  I wonder if I'll act like that after school!Anyways, back to the story, Santa goes back to his hometown with limited magic.  We're introduced to a frigid principal that has punished Santa's son for displaying some Christmas spirit.  More fun ensues as Santa tries to find and woo the next Mrs. Clause.  To seal the deal, his Santa magic gives him the edge and results in some very nice scenes of the movie.I won't go any further as you get the idea.  Overall, The Santa Clause 2 is a nice, snuggly movie that will keep you in the holiday spirit.  It's not groundbreaking material, but it has a nice message and should put a smile on anyone's face.My IMDb Rating: 7/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: B (Good)",The Santa Clause 2
44,moviemattb,"Not needed, but its fun in a good way",7,23 December 2014,"""The Santa Clause 2"" takes place eight years after the first one as Scott Calvin is enjoying to be Santa Claus as things start to happen to him. First, his son Charlie is sixteen years old and happens to be in the naughty list; and second, he has to find a wife by Christmas Eve or his life as Santa is over and done. I know that most of you would say that this sequel to a really popular movie is unnecessary that it did not need to be turned into a franchise. To me, I understand how you would feel about but I was already having a fun time with this movie in a good way. This was the only ""Santa Clause"" movie that I've seen in a theater, while the first one I only first saw on an old VHS copy but the third movie is the one I never saw. I don't think I would be bother to check that one out because everyone say that it was worse than the second that I am reviewing. Maybe I would, maybe I won't. Anyway, I thought Tim Allen is still at his game as he plays both good and bad Santa Claus. Eric Lloyd is also good in it, and a fine way to take his character in a different direction. Elizabeth Mitchell is really good to play the ""Mrs. Clauses,"" but I say no more about. The movie does have some good laughs, while some are not really good. The special effects aren't that good, and the design of the reindeers look like they should be an amusement park. So cartoonish they all looked. The first one had better design of the reindeers compare to this. So, yeah I actually do like this movie. Not as good as the first, but its harmless enough to be a fun Christmas movie.

45,ed_two_o_nine,Christmas Movies are a Strange Breed,6,26 December 2007,"Christmas movies that strange breed, especially of the modern variety, where they seem to have to aimed at children exclusively (with no regard for the adults who more often than not have to sit through the films with the children. Or maybe it is a reflection on modern society where films are put on the DVD player to keep children amused whilst their parents are doing other things) so much for the movie that appeals to the whole family. Saying that I was pleasantly surprised by Santa Clause 2 and though I would not choose to watch this film again alone I would definitely view it with children and would recommend it to parents who want to watch a movie with their children.The basic premise of the film is that Santa (Tim Allen) had to find a wife or face no longer being able to be Santa. The film has all the normal moral obstacles for the greater good along the way that you expect but still manages to be enjoyable.The cast cope well with roles that are frankly not very demanding, with some solid supporting characters that help flesh out the movie.In the end by no means is this a classic but you could do a lot worse that this.

46,smashattack,Not enough like the first.,4,17 November 2002,"I need to give a few spoilers.I was hopeful to find something original, funny, and inventive when I went to see The Santa Clause 2.  Instead I found a rather childish, corny movie that made me embarrassed to watch it.Don't get me wrong, though.  Some parts are absolutely hilarious.  The toy Santa's first sip of hot cocoa is rather humorous.  But other parts that tried to be funny were rather stupid.  Such as the ""talking"" reindeer.  I liked it much better in the first one when Comet only grunted, rather than spewed out garbled nonsense.  Some of it was funny, but it was taken too far.The North Pole was a very distracting, annoying place to be.  It seemed so far from reality that I was always praying it would get to another scene. Once Scott Calvin started turning back to ""normal"", I was much relieved. The movie felt so much better, much more real, emotional, and humorous. Unfortunately, not enough of the movie was seen in the real world with the real Scott Calvin.It was really corny and childish in the beginning.  But in the middle, when Scott begins to fall for Principal Newman, I could really feel what was going on.  I was connected to the characters, and truly hoped the best for them.  It didn't last long, however.  Too soon was Scott rushing off to the North Pole, where I still felt very uncomfortable.And possibly the worst villains of all movie history would be the huge toy soldiers.  I'm sorry, but that was absolutely stupid!  They were no threat... they could only walk and stretch out their arms!  The ""final battle"" involving them shouldn't have lasted any more than a minute.The ""duel"" between the real Santa and the toy Santa, however, was well made. I enjoyed the skirmish atop the sled as they raced to the top of the underground cave.The music was absolutely... cheerful.  Way too cheerful, even in sad parts. It was more of a distraction than anything.  I can't even recall who composed it, and I've been spending all afternoon working on dumping it out of my brain.The Santa Clause 2 is, in essence, for younger children, which is a shame since the first was really good.  I was really disappointed.  I wouldn't really recommend seeing it in theaters, but DVD will do fine.",The Santa Clause 2
47,Sunsphxsuns,A VERY WORTHY SEQUEL TO THE ORIGINAL,10,3 November 2021,"This 2nd installment of the Santa Clause trilogy begins with Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) learning he must immediately find a wife and get married or lose his magical powers as Santa Claus forever. Without a Santa to deliver toys, there can be no Christmas. To complicate matters, this is all happening during the Christmas manufacturing rush at the North Pole, the busiest time of the year, and clearly this news could not come at a worse time.Santa now has four short weeks to find a wife and thereby save Christmas. But time is running out. Santa is becoming noticeably thinner, his red suit is suddenly too large, and his image branding white beard has disappeared. The ""de-sanctification process"" has begun, and for the world's children the outlook is grim. There is hope, however, because there is indeed a romance in the works for Santa after he meets the fetching School Principal, Carol Newman (Elizabeth Mitchell).The Santa Clause 2 almost did not happen. Tim Allen admitted he was initially reluctant to reprise his role as Santa because the extensive makeup and fat suit he wore took hours to apply and later remove. Thankfully, and much to the collective relief of Disney Studios and audiences, Allen accepted the role.In addition to Allen, we see the return of his ex-wife, Laura (Wendy Crewson), her husband, Neil (Judge Reinhold), and Calvin and Laura's son, Charlie (Eric Lloyd). Charlie is now a teenager, with all of the requisite pent up angst suffered by kids his age, except his problems are painfully amplified by the secret he must keep to himself (that knowledge being his father is actually the real Santa Claus).Like the first Santa Clause this sequel boasts few special effects, which generously allows the touching story to unfold on its own. The Santa Clause 2 is a very worthy successor to the original 1994 film for children and adults alike. It's great entertainment and absolutely compliments the holiday season and the celebration of family relationships.No spoilers here (as usual) but I will reveal that one of Santa's ""blind dates"" in his quest to find a suitable wife features some of the funniest scenes in the film, thanks to a very edgy improvisational performance from SNL alumni Molly Shannon. You will remember her gutsy cameo long after the credits roll.",The Santa Clause 2

I just like the fact that's it's Rated ""G"", unlike the first one, which was ""PG."" **The following is a minor spoiler** It's VERY predictable, however. It's obvious, to very smart people, that Carol will be the future Mrs. Claus. I like the fact that Santa needs to find a wife before Christmas, and Tim Allen played triple roles, Santa Claus, Scott Calvin, and the Toy Santa, who becomes the world's first mad toy. He pays for it later, though. He becomes a miniature toy, and we get to see Charlie, played by the same actor in the first movie Eric Lloyd, and man, was he ever cool.My favorite character, though, is Lucy, Laura and Neal's a seven-year-old daughter. She is the whole reason that makes this movie worth watching.Overall, it's a good movie. L:et's hope that if there's a third movie, it won't be as predictable.My Score: 7/10.",The Santa Clause 2

But Santa's world is turned upside down when he's dealt a double whammy of bad news: not only has his son, Charlie, landed on this year's `naughty' list, but if Scott doesn't marry by Christmas Eve, he'll stop being Santa forever. Desperate, Scott turns to the elves' new invention - a machine that can replicate anything - to create Santa II and he leaves his double in charge. Things quickly go south at the North Pole when Santa II institutes some strange redefinitions of what's naughty and nice; worse, when Scott finally falls for a potential Mrs. Claus, she threatens to drive a wedge between him and Charlie. In a climactic battle pitting Santa, Charlie, the new Mrs. Claus, and the elves against Santa II and his army of tin soldiers, the future of Scott's family, the North Pole, and Christmas itself, hangs in the balance.
After a horrorific Halloween, the last thing you would expect would be a Christmas themed film. But here we are with the sequel to the 1994 smash hit, The Santa Clause. The movie opened modestly but soon gained popularity and was selling to packed houses over the Thanksgiving weekend. It just made natural sense for the Walt Disney Company to return with a sequel. The Santa Clause 2 was originally slanted for release in 2001 but the executives at Disney became aware that sequels to moderately old films won't automatically become the same hit as the original after 102 Dalmatians flopped in 2000 thanks in part to The Grinch. After the script was revised, Tim Allen finally returns as the big guy after eight years. But this time around, he doesn't have his hit TV show to bring in the sure-fire crowd like before. Will The Santa Clause 2 be as magical as the original or will the sequel follow the same steps as 102 Dalmatians?The story goes that Scott Calvin has been Santa for eight years and it declared the best Santa ever by his elves and the children of the world. But his helper elves find that they missed a clause in his contract that states that he must get married before Christmas Eve or else he will not be Santa ever again. On top of this delema, his son Charlie has been found on the naughty list for incidents at school that involve his principal, who Scott soon falls head over heels for. But he soon must return to the North Pole as the temporary toy replacement takes in new order at the North Pole. The story was very well done. It introduced all the original characters in very nice fashion and brings good attention to brand new ones like Curtis, the keeper of the Santa handbook. One of the especially good parts was how they introduced Miss Mitchell and how she soon came to be the love interest of Scott Calvin a.k.a. Santa Claus. There were little or no problems with the story that tries hard to live up to the original.The characters in The Santa Clause 2 are very funny and do a great job of bringing the audience into the holiday world of the North Pole. Tim Allen is as funny as ever reprising his famous role as the big guy himself, Santa Claus. Spence Breslin is very amusing as Curits and really shows off his mature acting abilities in a comedy, which will be needed when he appears in The Cat in the Hat with Mike Myers in 2003. Elizabeth Mitchell is great as Charlie's principal. She really brings the romance into this familty comedy that is needed to offset some of the goofiness that happens all around but doesn't draw too much attention away from other important scenes. All the original characters are back and do a extraordinary jobs returning to their old roles.Overall, The Santa Clause 2 is as funny or better then the 1994 original in many areas of the story and characters. Though the movie does seem perfect but there are slight flaws to this beautifully wrapped package. The main problem is the moral lesson expressed in the film. They are stated in lines of the film and come off as way too tacky especially with the emotional music playing. This is okay for a family audience but can get on nerves to older audience. This does not ruin the film in the least. The Santa Clause 2 does everything it sets out to achieve and does so with great flare. If this film does well enough, you might expect another sequel but even if this is the last chapter in the Santa Clause films then it goes off on a fabulous note. If there is one holiday film to take your kids to see this November, take them to see The Santa Clause 2. You won't forget it and neither will your kids after they are done laughing their heads off. And no worries for adults, the jokes appeal to both children and adults. Look for hidden Disney jokes and even a few Buzz Lightyear lines slipped into the story. One of the few films that lives up to the original.My Rating: ****1/2 out of 5",The Santa Clause 2
52,Sparrow_in_flight,It's okay,5,2 December 2003,"Well, it's not quite as good ass the first movie, in my opinion. Mainly because I found the talking reindeer to be a little too cutesy and they didn't look as realistic as in the first movie. And Bernard the Arch Elf wasn't as entertainng as in the first movie. But this movie does have several things going for it. For one, all of the main actors who were in the first movie have returned for this one. And the relationship between Scott and the principal is very cute to watch. The new elf Curtis is entertaining, and so is Charlie's little half sister. And the meeting of legendary figures was an intersting idea, although I think the Easter Bunny could have looked a little more realistic, or at least a little less ridiculous.",The Santa Clause 2

55,Welly-2,Enjoyable but tries a little too hard.,6,2 January 2008,"This tries really hard and with some success, but it doesn't have the same levels of wit and charm of the first film. It may simply be that it's trying too hard. The pleasure of the first film was its humour and the hint of edginess that Tim Allen brought; the sequel sees, as so often happens, another victory for special effects and a bigger budget.This is only a minor humbug, however. It's still great fun and passes a Christmas afternoon in a perfectly pleasant way. Elizabeth Mitchell is tremendous as Principal Newman and steals the show and Allen remains a top performer who connects with an audience in a way Robin Williams can only dream of. The son as a teenager has some value as a plot device but ends up being annoying rather than innovative and the rogue Santa idea bombs very badly. In fact, the plot lines get just too silly throughout. Keep it simple, it's Christmas.Bottom line...fine Christmas fare but could do better.",The Santa Clause 2
56,AW_McGOWAN,"Christmas Sequel Caters To Kids, But Is Still Fun For All",5,21 December 2020,"Eight years after the release of 1994's ""The Santa Clause,"" Tim Allen dons the red suit and white beard yet again for ""The Santa Clause 2."" Rated G rather than its predecessor's PG, ""The Santa Clause 2"" is much more kid-friendly than the original - made more exclusively for children rather than for the entire family. Still, all can find enjoyment in this wholesome holiday comedy.At ""The Santa Clause 2's"" opening, nearly a decade has gone by since Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) knocked the previous Saint Nick off his rooftop and assumed the role of Santa. Since then, kids have been happier than ever; the Christmas spirit is abloom worldwide and North Pole productivity is at an all time high.This façade of perfection in Calvin's life soon falls apart when his head elf, Bernard (David Krumholtz) and number two, Curtis (Spencer Breslin) inform him of another Clause in the Santa contract. In order to remain Santa, Calvin must find a Mrs. Clause before Christmas Eve. Meanwhile, he also learns that his teenage son, Charlie (Eric Lloyd) is on the naughty list for acting out at school. With less than a month before the big day, Calvin must leave the workshop to reconcile with Charlie and hopefully find a wife, lest he give up his job as Santa and Christmas face cancellation.""The Santa Clause 2"" has just as many jokes as the first in the series, but it does not have the ordinary-guy-in-an-extraordinary-situation comedic trope that adults so readily relate to. In the first movie, Calvin is cynical and must learn to accept and appreciate the Santa Claus title. By the time the sequel begins, he loves the title more than anything in the world, and goes to great lengths to preserve it.In a word, ""The Santa Clause 2"" is much cuter than ""The Santa Clause."" On top of the shift away from adult-oriented themes, the film puts greater emphasis on the fantastical North Pole environment with more elaborate sets, panoramic shots, and elven characters. It also includes more reindeer and slapstick humor, plus an action climax where elves launch snowballs at giant toy soldiers while Calvin chases an antagonistic toy Santa through the air to prevent a worldwide coal delivery on Christmas.All of this makes ""The Santa Clause 2"" a highly cartoonish film, befitting the children's movies of the early 2000s rather than the more subtle, heartwarming family comedies of the 1990s. Pandering to its youthful target audience, the sequel feels more like something made for Disney Channel than a theatrical feature. Nevertheless, it is still enjoyable. Thanks in large part to Tim Allen's endearing performance, adults will retain regular laughs and bouts of intrigue throughout the otherwise childish movie.",The Santa Clause 2

There are times when humans feel very alone. But when I read reviews such as 'Im kind of partial to these kind of movies because I like to take the Spirit of Christmas and share it throughtout the year,"" and those exclaiming what a great family film this is? I want nothing to do with any human. ''The Santa Clause' was a fairly good film.

The script and most of the acting was weak, and though I will admit to laughing at a few of the jokes, much of it wasn't remotely funny.The Tooth Fairy provided a couple of snickers as did Michael Dorn as The Sandman.

The Santa Clause 2 brings back all of the characters from the first movie, and it is amazing how easy and flawlessly they can jump back into their beloved roles. The neat thing about this sequel is that it doesn't just take the characters from the original movie and spin an entirely different story. Instead, it builds upon the first one. New characters such as the hilarious Tooth Fairy and the beautiful Mrs. Claus are introduced, as well as the new lovable elf Curtis.Overall, a powerful sequel to a powerful movie.

67,thereseuphemiaabernathy,This Film's as Good as the Original.,10,6 December 2003,"The Santa Clause"" is a holiday movie that my family has watched and loved multiple times every year. It really captured the spirit of the day in a way that EVERYONE can appreciate. ""The Santa Clause 2"" was something I didn't bother to see in theaters, because it's been my experience that Disney can't do sequels right. Based on past failures, this could have truly been a terrible film. Luckily, I heard from a friend who became absolutely obsessed with it and counted down the days to its DVD release. She said it was not only, in her opinion, slightly better than the first, but that it was a generally wonderful and very funny movie. Sufficiently persuaded to purchase the DVD, I now can honestly say that I'm glad I did. In this movie, the entire original cast returns for a story that's actually quite clever for a ""part II."" Colorful and fun from beginning to end, the humor is genuine, and not the 'corny' kind you might expect. Actually, my favorite line is when the ""number two elf,"" Curtis, says, ""The Desantafication process has begun!"" He shouts it so loudly and rapidly it's scary--but mad humorous. If you don't already know the story, here it is in a nutshell: Scott needs a wife in order to remain Santa forever; the ""Mrs. Clause."" His son Charlie is falling into 'bad behavior' because he feels neglected and upset that he must keep his father's secret, when his dad's got the coolest job of all. While Scott is courting the school principal using magic, back at the North Pole, chaos is ensuing as the toy santa goes awry and develops a persona not unlike Hitler. He whips the elves into long, miserable work hours and is just basically cruel, screwing up the entire process of Christmas by deciding that most kids are naughty and they all deserve only coal. The reindeer, Scott's ex-wife and Neil, the hilarious Council of Legendary Figures, etc., all combine to make a truly satisfying movie that is a very, very worthy successor to ""The Santa Clause."" I am pleased to say, a longtime fan of the original was not disappointed at all. (Warning: The most irritating character by far is Molly Shannon's small role of Tracy, Scott's first dismal attempt at finding a Mrs. Clause. Tracy has an unhealthy obsession with country music and bursts into a highly embarrassing singing-and-dancing performance of a Shania Twain song with lyrics twisted to be about Christmas--UNDER THE WATCH OF EVERYONE IN A PUBLIC RESTAURANT WITHIN FIVE MINUTES OF THE START OF A FIRST DATE. Something's wrong with this woman. She's one of those, ""I-am-not-with-her, I've-never-seen-her-before-in-my-life"" kind of humiliating freaks of nature whom you'd NEVER wanna be caught dead with in public. The scene is funny--still, I dunno about anyone else, but I felt really awful for Scott. I mean, he responded the way any normal red-blooded American would, and then Tracy storms out on him for not ""supporting her ambition"" when she ""put herself out there"" which she claims was ""not an easy thing to do."") Bernard has a big role, and is even more likable in this one; he doesn't like Curtis much, but he's used to having Scott as Santa. ""Chet"" is the new, inexperienced reindeer-in-training who is completely horrible at guiding a sleigh--or just flying, for that matter. The Tooth Fairy, who wants to change his name to Tooth Man, Tooth Guy, Molinator, Tooth, Plaque Man, Captain Floss, or as I recall, Roy, is hysterical. ""No kid will leave a tooth under their pillow for some guy named Roy,"" claims Cupid. Eh heh...it's probably true. Also, BE SURE TO WATCH THE SPECIAL FEATURES!! They're excellent. The interview with the Legendary Figures is hilarious. Gotta love Cupid. ""Deleted scenes"" & ""gag reel"" are tons of fun. Watch the movie with the audio commentary from Micheal Lembeck as well as the hysterically funny ten-minute ""Exploring the North Pole w/ Curtis."" These are too much fun & they give greater insight into the rivalry betwixt Curtis and Bernard. Banana, anyone?! So on the whole, it's a great film. For everybody. I'd see it if I were you. Terrific holiday movie. A new tradition will be watching the first followed by the second each year.",The Santa Clause 2
68,Jemarus,Enjoyable Sequel,10,14 September 2007,"In 2002, I was really glad to hear that a sequel to The Santa Clause was coming out. I enjoyed the first movie, and I was glad to see that the storyline was being further advanced. Unfortunately, I was unable to see the movie when it first came out in 2002, and I didn't get to see it until 3 years later. When I first watched it, I was unsure what to think. I had trouble deciding whether it was better or not as good as the original.Currently, I feel that both movies have their strong points, although I think I may lean more toward the original. Regardless, this movie was good in its own way. One of the things I liked is that Neal and Scott seemed to have resolved their differences and that they were much friendlier toward each other.Another thing that I really liked about this film was that the same actors were used to play the major characters. Even more impressive to me was that the characters (primarily Charlie) aged 8 years - the length of time from the first movie to this one. I think those are qualities that make an excellent sequel.Indeed, this was a good sequel. It was certainly much better than many other sequels. However, the plot was a little bit different and not quite as interesting as the first movie. Then again, sometimes I think it's even better than the original. Basically, it depends on my mood. Nonetheless, I do generally hold a high opinion of this movie. I would recommend seeing it.",The Santa Clause 2

Just so I don't spoil the magic, I will say only the following:  Tim Allen was excellent as Santa... he made me feel like I was ten again.  The character Bernard was just as bossy as I remembered from the first film, but the quips he fires off were in shorter supply.  I missed the sarcastic humor I associate with him.  Charlie is growing up, but in the best way possible. He had some touching lines near the end to a new character-- I won't ruin the surprise of whom.Yes, there was an inappropriate flatulence joke in the movie, but all in all that was the only concession to bathroom humor in an otherwise classy family comedy.  Yes, there were plot holes, some of which were large enough to drive a sleigh through, but after eight years and five writers, the end product was satisfactory.On its own: 10/10 for combined effort and execution.  As a sequel: 8/10. Good character continuity, interesting new spin.  I'm happy to say I didn't spot large amounts of rehash.Recommended for:  families with small children and college students old enough to remember the first ""Clause"" and just need to de-stress around midterms or finals.",The Santa Clause 2
72,neerdowell,Where's The Whimsy?,4,9 October 2006,"The Santa Clause 2 is lacking in a very key area that the first movie had by the bushel - whimsy. The first Santa Clause was a delicious holiday treat that has become a holiday tradition in my home. We had very big hopes for the sequel, considering they were handed great material for the follow-up - finding a Mrs. Claus for Santa. And truthfully, the best parts of this movie are the parts that take place with Scott in the ""real world"" trying to find a wife. Yes, it's predictable that Scott will hook up with his son's ""bah, humbug"" principal, but the journey is a lot of fun. Between the hilarious bad date with Molly Shannon's Christmas-lovin' character and the delightfully whimsical scene where Scott magically transforms the boring teacher's Christmas party into a trip into everyone's inner child, the holiday magic is there.Unfortunately, there was the ugly other side to this movie - the scenes taking place back at the North Pole, where Santa's look-alike toy replacement is wreaking havoc. Totally devoid of the whimsy that the other half of this movie achieves, the North Pole scenes drag this movie down to mediocre. Let me count the ways the filmmakers went wrong... Bernard is a totally different head elf from the first movie, and far less appealing. His character is more paranoid and spastic, which was absolutely the wrong way to go. Curtis the elf is obnoxious. I don't know who this kid is, but I hate him in every movie he's in. You simply do NOT give the ""token fat kid"" a major role in a feature film. It doesn't work, and neither does this kid as Curtis. (It is a REALLY, REALLY bad sign that Bernard is not slated to be in the third installment of Santa Clause - the Escape Clause. Instead, Curtis is evidently going to return as the new head elf. GAG. That bit of casting and plot line has ""oh, no"" written all over it.) They also changed the reindeer in the second movie. Instead of the intelligent, unspeaking creatures that worked so well in several scenes in the first movie, they have been reduced to a fart joke. And now they can speak, though it's in a silly, cartoonish voice. Don't even get me started on ""Chet"" the redneck mentally-disturbed reindeer. What a nightmare.So if you want whimsy and feelings of holiday delight, watch the first movie. Make that one your tradition. Santa Clause 2: The Mrs. Clause is a woeful sequel that you won't need to see more than once. Which is good, because you won't WANT to see it more than once.",The Santa Clause 2

(or anything else Tim Allen has done for that matter.) Consider some of the examples of the type of humor contained in the movie 1)a reindeer who farts after eating too much and 2) the ever classic standby: running into stuff while flying.Pardon me if i don't laugh but this is one movie worth passing up.for a family movie it is average (entertaining for kids and mildly amusing at best for adults) but as a movie it is pretty bad. i gave this one a 3 out of 10.",The Santa Clause 2
74,JMoviebuff0001,Joyful Sequel,6,4 November 2006,"The Santa Clause 2 is a decent sequel. I was very excited when I first saw a trailer for it. I can't remember it too well but I think I was going to see The Fellowship of the Ring and out in the lobby the theater has TV screens which show trailers and I believe Tim Allen was talking about the movie. Anyways I saw the movie opening weekend and loved it.Sure the movie is not as magical as the first but its a passable sequel filled with laughs. The story is simple, after eight years of being a single Santa, Scott is informed of the single most important part in Christmas History: The Mrs. Clause. This proposes a challenge for Scott as he must find a wife by Christmas Eve or he doesn't get to be Santa anymore.BUT he also faces an equally tough challenge, his son Charlie has landed on the naughty list. A third challenge not as tough arises, how to keep running the factory while being with Charlie. Curtis(an annoying side-kick to Bernard) has devised a plan to clone Santa. The result: A Toy Santa.Santa goes to be with Charlie and to find a wife, he is given a limited amount of magic to use and has the funny Comet to fly with. Neil Miller is still wearing those obnoxious sweaters. Anyways with time and magic running out Scott does his best to win the heart of Carol Newman, Charlie's school principal, and trying to figure out what caused Charlie to become naughty.The end result a funny family film with a sweet taste of magic even though it lacked the sweetness of the first, it still manages to pass as a decent enjoyable sequel.

We have stupid reindeer that talk like they are drunk, instead of when in the first one they were silent and smart. Then the plastic Santa is so stupid. So unnecessary. Bernard became more paranoid not at all how certain he was in the first. For my sister and I we just skip the fake Santa parts. When it is just Santa looking for a wife it is more like the first so that's what I enjoy. However that is still a stretch.

77,unhappygilmore,"Good movie, with some great moments",7,24 November 2003,"This movie was uneven, but overall pretty satisfying. 
Worst part:  the first thirty minutes.  It took forever to get going. 
Best part:  the middle twenty minutes, climaxing in the faculty Christmas party (one of the best Christmas scenes in any holiday movie ever).  If only the rest of the movie could've been this good.  Never would have thought Tim Allen could pull off a romance, but the kiss under the mistletoe scene was pretty magical.A few questions:If kids who are complete strangers innately know Scott is Santa Claus, how come Lucy doesn't?If the elf Curtis is such a stickler for the rules, why is he introduced as a crazy loose cannon?Was teenage Charlie seriously crying because other kids can say their dads are plumbers, but he can't tell anyone his dad is Santa Claus?  What is wrong with this kid?Overall, it was a good movie.  Kudos to Art Lafleur, who's brilliant as the Tooth Fairy, Liliana Mumy, who's adorable as Lucy, and Elizabeth Mitchell, who does some interesting things as the love interest (although she lets out a few too many fake laughs).",The Santa Clause 2

Being eight years after the original, I believe the film makers designed a well crafted solution to the tastes of both the teens and young adults that seen the first movie, to the kids that never saw the first Santa Clause.First thing first, for new fans, do watch Santa Clause.  Though you won't be totally confused, watching the first movie, could prevent your young one's from asking questions such as ""How does Santa get into the Chimney?"", ""How did he become Santa Clause?"" Theses questions and more are answered in the first movie. If you don't have the movie, a trip to a video and/or DVD store is recommended. It will just allow you to enjoy the movie even more.*Mild Spoilers*Unlike the first movie, Santa Clause / Scott Calvin, is settled as Santa Claus, loving his job, and the elves love him too.  He believes everything is just merry, until oops he needs a wife.  Eight year-old Charlie is now a cute teenager. And Neil,Laura, and Scott interactions are just so funny. Fun stuff for both kids and adults. Comedy, Romance, Action, more. Worth the price of admission!",The Santa Clause 2
79,Bruce-132,It is what it is,10,12 November 2002,"Feel good. Laugh a LOT. Be surprised. Most of all, ""Seeing isn't believing, believing is seeing."" Add the sequel expectation (sequel equals flop) and then you'll be VERY pleasantly surprised. Even with 95% of the theater being kids, and the woman who's child had to go into a screaming panic every time he saw Santa, it was well worth the money, and I'll buy the video as soon as it's available.",The Santa Clause 2
80,JustinFinch-Fletchley,"OK, but just not the same",2,2 November 2002,"I absolutely love ""The Santa Clause"" part one.  It really gets me into the Christmas spirit, and it's hilarious.  But this second part isn't quite the same.  Each actor's performance is not as good as the first movie.  The one exception is Eric Lloyd as Charlie.  But the plot is too confused, and things are just too rushed.  It's missing the charm and humor of the first. It's not horrible, but it just doesn't give the same Christmas feeling ""The Santa Clause"" originally had.",The Santa Clause 2
81,sherriberri,Awesome,10,29 October 2002,"Santa Clause 2 is a worthy sequel to the original one.  Tim Allen has found his nitch with Santa Clause and the wonderful addition of Elizabeth Mitchell makes this movie an entertaining, heart warming Christmas movie.  Why Hollywood is not using Ms. Mitchell more is a mystery.  Tim Allen and Elizabeth Mitchell have a natural chemistry and it isn't a forced romance on screen.  Tim Allen is naturally funny but he seems more comfortable in the Santa Suit this time.  There were moments where my children did become restless but all in all I would have to give this movie two thumbs up and I would give it 4 out of 5 stars.",The Santa Clause 2
82,TrumpetOfTheLord,The appeal of this movie......,4,5 December 2002,"is to persons average age 4. The plot is juvenile, the outcome is predictable, and the storyline is about half as good as the original movie.Tim Allen gives his usual Class ""B"" act.Consequently, that is its rating from me (a 4 out of 10).",The Santa Clause 2
83,celenazinc,Funny family flick.,8,18 September 2005,"This second installment of the Santa Clause franchise wasn't quite as good as the first movie, but it was a very good film on it's own. I don't think the first Santa Clause can be topped, but this is a decent sequel. The old characters we know from the first movie all return and the new ones introduced could have used a teeny bit more characterization, but were overall enjoyable. The Santa impostor has some pretty hilarious moments/lines. While a weird idea, it worked for this movie. You should be in the mood for a very silly light hearted fantasy tale when you watch this movie. Watch the ending credits for some funny added footage from the film.",The Santa Clause 2
84,karry-1,"Good for kids, not as good as original",5,13 November 2002,"First of all, let me say that I really enjoyed watching `The Santa Clause'. I found the storyline to be original and entertaining for both children and adults.  The humor was clean for the children yet sophisticated enough to keep adults entertained.  When the DVD came out I purchased it immediately so the kids (and I) could enjoy it over and over.  I was eagerly anticipating the sequel `The Santa Clause 2' when I saw the theatrical trailer at the movie theater.  Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed when we finally went to see it.  It was ok as a kid's movie but it lacked a lot in the original storyline department.  The story and the humor was dumbed way down to pander to kids and left very little for adults to enjoy.  I especially did not care for the fact that they found it necessary in the sequel to have the reindeer talk like Scooby Doo.  I'm not saying it's a bad movie, I'm just saying that if you're an adult and expecting anything like the original, you will be disappointed.",The Santa Clause 2
85,R_Ahab,I loved this movie :-),10,2 November 2002,"I thought that Santa Clause 2 outshined Santa Clause 1 in every way! This movie was laugh-out-loud funny, sweet, clean, and just a feel-good, leave-the-theater-happy kind of movie.There are scenes that will have you cracking up days later.  Tim Allen is one funny dude, and his delivery and timing are perfect.And just for your information, I don't have kids.  My husband and I just enjoy wholesome family entertainment.  Santa Clause 2 is that and then some!!  I give it a 10 out of 10.  Great holiday flick!",The Santa Clause 2
86,jpfortney,Very enjoyable sequel,10,22 December 2003,"This was a very fun movie!  Easily as fun as the first.  It had a great mix of humor, romance and 'feel good'.  The first movie gave me the feeling of joy at the thought of grownups finding the wonder of Christmas again (Laura and Neal realizing Scott was indeed Santa).  The second gave me that same feeling (the staff Christmas party).  I'm kind of partial to these kind of movies because I like to take the Spirit of Christmas and share it throughtout the year.  I liked the attitude of Bernard more in the first one.  He seemed more on top of things, a little cocky, very in control. Other than that, I can't think of a thing I didn't like about this movie. And no bad language!  Great for the entire family. 10/10",The Santa Clause 2
87,philyben,I like Tim,8,6 November 2002,"Took my little brother and sister. I think I enjoyed it even more than they did. Tim A. is always funny. He's likeable and you don't get tired of him after a while. The movie was not filled with tons of special effects. It also was not a overly ""sweet"" as most Christmas movies.",The Santa Clause 2
88,joab-70946,"Enjoyable, funny, cute movie",8,14 November 2017,"This was a very fun movie! It kept me smiling all the way through. In the sequel, Santa Claus is losing his magical powers. There was a hidden clause in his contract that he had to marry by a certain time or he would lose all his magic powers. So, he goes back home to date and helps straighten his son out who was on the naughty list. While away, Santa's lead elves make a clone of Santa so the other elves won't worry about Santa being away. The fake Santa is pretty funny as he learns the enjoyment of cocoa among other things. Then he gets completely out-of- hand and goes on a power trip. The tooth fairy even plays a part in this film. So Santa HAS to get married. Fast. Will he do it? This is the type of film that helps people better appreciate the holiday season. If you want a funny, enjoyable, cute, movie the entire family can go see, even your young kids, then I highly recommend this film.",The Santa Clause 2
89,wphillips316,good ending to a horrible beginning,6,1 December 2002,"Possibly the worst first 30 minutes to any movie that I watched all the way thru.  It was long, boring, and not the least funny.  Finally the movie took off and the last hour or so was very good, just a tad below the first one. Good santa vs. bad santa was funny, good reindeer chase scene.  Mrs. clause, very hot.",The Santa Clause 2
90,gagolfer,1:45 movie flew by,10,5 November 2002,"The sequel may have been better than the first. Our 10 & 6 year old girls were thoroughly focused for the entire movie (allowing my wife and I to thoroughly enjoy along with them). We went after seeing some somewhat cynical reviews, so our thorough enjoyment was enhanced by writing off the critics review after the movie!",The Santa Clause 2
91,SummerRain445,Very Entertaining!,10,17 November 2002,"This movie was very entertaining! I laughed almost the whole time, the music was phenomenal, and the graphics were awesome....The first was funny, but this was a whole heck of a lot funnier, along with a great cast of some new characters....a great movie for the whole family!",The Santa Clause 2
92,Kat_D,A GREAT movie!!!!!,10,30 November 2002,This is a GREAT family movie. I think it's better and funnier than the first movie. Tim Allen and the other actors and actresses are great. The technical effects really make it seem magical. I REALLY LOVE this this movie!,The Santa Clause 2
93,Suuuzzzzze,A Great feel good movie to ring in Holiday Cheer for kids with there family member or members.,10,12 November 2002,"Single parents and married parents will love watching this movie with their kids.  It is exactly what a hectic holiday pace needs to make the busy, pressured, commercialized hoopla of ""Christmas Joy"" enjoyable. Everyone should go see this simple, but heavenly tale. It was worth the price of the ticket.  I loved it!",The Santa Clause 2
94,gigntrue,Unnecessary sequel to a decent flick.,5,30 December 2003,The first Santa Clause was a decent holiday movie. The second is just over kill with a story that does not even try to be different. Tim Allen is good and goofy at the same time but this movie really did not have been made.They is really no reason for it.,The Santa Clause 2
95,figflagg,"Hilarious & Touching -- a 'sure thing' for kids, a nostalgic 'must' for adults!",10,11 October 2002,"I had the fortunate opportunity to attend a pre-released screening of The Santa Clause 2.  It was not only delightful, funny, magical, nostalgic and charming -- it dispelled the general myth that sequels fall short of the original classic.  Of course, this movie is a 'sure thing' for kids -- a guaranteed great holiday classic -- (I mean, we ARE, after all, talking about the legendary Santa), but moreover, it is a movie geared for adults!   Not just because it's so clever and funny, but because the storyline revolves around what we adults do quietly everyday.  It's about the difficult, yet expected task of keeping all the balls in the air -- our job, our responsibilities, our kids  -- and all the while, doing our best to maintain our integrity despite life's incredible challenges.  Santa's job might be, well... unique, but he is definitely all of us.  And he let's us discover the gentler side that trades up personal 'wants',  just for the sheer pleasure of giving to others. Oh, I'm sorry -- did I mention it's hilarious?!?!  Talented, funny-man, Tim Allen, is definitely on top of his 'movie star' game (with the new addition of his driven 'Toy Santa' alter-ego),  and it was great to see the old cast back in action with many welcomed new-comers.  Elizabeth Mitchell plays an endearing, romantic interest with superb character balance,  and director, Michael Lembeck, has landed himself a new brilliant feature film career!  (Composer, George Clinton, enhances with his incredible score and Molly Shannon's laugh-out-loud scene is NOT to be missed!) SERIOUSLY, have you ever seen 8-14 year-old boys in a theater audience cheering on a romance?  ""Come on!  Kiss her!""  Believe me -- it's a rare experience. I'm predicting that The Santa Clause 2 is going to have a lot of repeat business in its 2 month run, and hey -- perhaps all sequels should spend 8 years to find the right story worth telling to honor (and exceed) the original!",The Santa Clause 2
96,cipryan83,Best movie I've seen yet,10,9 March 2014,"It's the first time I've rated an IMDb movie with 10 stars and it's my first review just because this is a great, great movie and it still has such a poor rate (5.5) and it does not make any sense for me. I've read all the q&a about IMDb rating system and the weighting of rates, but I still think that the IMDb rating system is way off. I've seen so many good movies with poor rates on IMDb and it just makes the rating system useless. I hope somebody can fix this!P.S. Just because I don't have enough lines in my review to be approved, I have to add more lines :).. So, I've noticed that there are multiple (good) reviews without any ratings added. Do these reviews count as 0/10 stars? Maybe this is why the rating is so way off?",The Santa Clause 2
97,laurslacrosse,Are you kidding me?,3,12 February 2012,"I am so done with all these crappy Christmas movies. They're all practically the same. I try to realize that you shouldn't gone with expectations from another movie. You should enjoy it for what it is...but this is unbelievable. It is a family movie, but it's an extremely lame one. I am so shocked they decided to make ANOTHER one. Tim Allen's just....awful actually. Again, the plot is stupid and extremely predictable. Again, i always try to look past that. Movies are supposed to be good, they're not supposed to be a mindless machine that takes up 2 hours of your time. For those of you who want to see a good Christmas family movie, please see The Polar Express or even the Grinch Stole Christmas. This is just wrong. By the way, Santa comes back to life (I was so bored) and Christmas is saved. All the enemies leave Santa alone. His kid doesn't act up anymore, and he falls in love with the school principal. So there's the end. Surprised? I'm sure you are.",The Santa Clause 2
98,jason-varble,Very pleased,10,26 October 2004,"This is a great family film/clean fun. Good to see with others. Fun to watch with children or as an adult. The focus of the film(plot) is clear. The characters/actors were well chosen. It wasn't too long, and it kept ones suspense. This is the type of film, I feel, that helps people better appreciate the holiday season. The film had no explicit scenes, so it could be watched with children.The focus of the film was to make one laugh and to apply the romantic need for togetherness. Excellently done...",The Santa Clause 2
99,Kathy138,"Watching this film, I had to stifle the urge to laugh several times at the sheer stupidity of the plot, scripting, acting and ""special effects"".",1,3 January 2005,"Watching this film, I had to stifle the urge to laugh several times at the sheer stupidity of the plot, scripting, acting and ""special effects"". Any film having so many child actors in pretty major roles is just asking for trouble. The acting was abysmal, and no wonder with such a shallow plot to go on. You could almost drive a monster truck through the many plot holes in the story. The special effects were so bad, you could almost see a black line around the agent in shot. The best part of this film was, for me, the ending when it finally finished and I didn't have to sit through any more mindless minutes of very poor film-making, an insult to the world of film. I have seen better home movies.",The Santa Clause 2
