0,SnoopyStyle,great actors performances,7,8 June 2014,"It's Osage County, Oklahoma. Violet Weston (Meryl Streep) has quite a mouth and the mouth cancer to go with it. She's crass, addicted to painkillers, and the bitter matriarch of the dysfunctional family. Her youngest daughter Ivy (Julianne Nicholson) is still close by dutifully helping out but easily dismissed by Violet. Her sister Mattie Fae Aiken (Margo Martindale) keeps sticking around with her husband Charlie (Chris Cooper). Favorite oldest daughter Barbara (Julia Roberts) has returned with her separated husband Bill Fordham (Ewan McGregor) and daughter Jean (Abigail Breslin). Violet's husband Beverly (Sam Shepard) has enough of the her difficulties and walks off. He is found drowned and the family gathers for the funeral. The middle daughter Karen (Juliette Lewis) returns with new fiancé Steve Huberbrecht (Dermot Mulroney). Little Charles Aiken (Benedict Cumberbatch) is the loser son of Mattie Fae and Charlie who overslept for the funeral.There are a lot of great actors doing Oscar caliber work. The best thing director John Wells does is to point the camera and let these actors work. Meryl Streep is the master, and there is no way to describe her work with justice. Julia Roberts kept up with her and that is high praise for any actor. Every person in the cast deliver some of their best work. Writer Tracy Letts' play is all the same tone. That is the movie's biggest drawback. It is all vile and all bitterness. It is the same tone over and over again. It is overkill without any letup. I just enjoyed it for the performances.",August - Osage County
1,Hitchcoc,Functioning Dysfunction,8,30 January 2014,"Granted, I wouldn't last five minutes with this bunch. But having grown up with people not unlike this, I found the parrying and thrusting to be quite real. These characters are all inflicted with the same disease; they need love and drill for it, but they are incapable of letting go of their submerged self-hatred and continue to bring each other down. If you can get past that, you can sit and watch the disaster happen and appreciate some really intense performances. Black comedy is not ""funny"" the way that farce or physical comedy are. Black comedy draws its strength from seeing our lives as absurd and unfulfilled and still going on. Sartre thought that we all had had a terrible joke pulled on us. If we live in this septic tank, bless us. If we can rise above it, bless us too. The dialogue is real, the awful failure to express love and respect is well presented, painful as it may be. While this was not a pleasant experience, I could not take my eyes off the principles. I think about this movie all the time which means it must have got to me.",August - Osage County
2,boblipton,"When They Sink, We Seem the Higher",2,1 February 2014,"Tolstoy wrote that all happy families are alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. How did he know? Tolstoy's unhappy people are quite apparently drawn from life. He knew them intimately. He observed them closely because people who are happy don't see much reason to change, while people who are unhappy do -- or should. Change brings drama. Therefore, Tolstoy worked hard at making sure that he understood every nuance of unhappy people, because that was his job. Happy people were not. Therefore, he wasn't interested.That doesn't mean that happy people are less interesting. It means that their efforts to make themselves happy are subtle and less dramatic. This brings us to AUGUST: OSAGE COUNTY, in which a man has left his family, a family he loves and cherishes, because they make him so miserable he must take some time off every once in a while. And when he has killed himself rather than put up with them any longer, they gather together and work very hard to make each other miserable. They complain. They blame other people. They do mean things. They act, in short, in ways that if anyone you knew behaved, you would never see them again. They make it apparent why the man who killed himself was smart to do so.And we are expected to pay the price of admission to a theater (I saw it at a half-price matinée) and spend two hours of our lives for the pleasures of observing people we don't like and don't wish to know because they behave badly, behaving badly? The joy of Meryl Streep in a bad wig cursing in an Okie accent palled soon enough that I left after an hour.I might have stuck around longer had anyone ever said anything worth hearing, either because it was interesting or because it was said in an interesting fashion. That, however, would frustrate the purpose of Tracy Letts, the writer of the movie and the play upon which it is based.That purpose is clearly to make us hate these obnoxious dullards. Portraying them that way will show what mean people they are. It will burnish the appearance of ability of the author and show the range of the actors. It's a win-win! And anyone who does not understand how important these matters are and who might be tempted to walk out is a dullard as bad as the people portrayed in this movie.Or, perhaps, they are people who, confronted with an unhappy situation, do something to change it. Perhaps they are people who wish others to avoid misery and will take a few minutes to write a review like this.",August - Osage County
3,Horst_In_Translation,Violet Weston and her daughters,6,14 September 2014,"""August: Osage County"" is director John Wells' jump to the big screen and it is a pretty successful leap. He won many prestigious awards in the past with TV productions such as ""Emergency Room"", ""The West Wing"" and ""Mildred Pierce"". And from directing Academy Award winner Kate Winslet there, he got Academy Award winners Julia Roberts and Meryl Streep here. Both also took acting nominations for their work here. For Roberts it is her fourth Academy Award nominations 13 years after her win for playing Erin Brockovich. Streep plays a matriarch always struggling between being the strong-willed woman in control of everything and a whiny sick senior. She sees right through her daughters: that the husband of Roberts' character has moved out, that her other daughter is dating her cousin... Streep does a great job with her eyes in that scene when she realizes what's going on with Nicholson and Cumberbatch.When the husband of Streep's character commits suicide, the three daughters show up and visit their mother and bring their own struggles with them. The reason behind that visit already says more than a thousand words.The film was written by Tracy Leets, known for Killer Joe and who is also one of the rising number of actor-turned-screenwriters. You may have seen him on Homeland in the past. The story is solid. It did not blow me away and I would say the best part of the movie is the acting from everybody involved, down to the smaller parts such as Dermot Mulroney. The final scene is pretty significant for all the relationships. Her daughters were thee and the only one that stays with her is the maid.I recommend this movie as we see several family secret surface as the film progresses during these 2 hours. It is not one of the best films of 2013, but certainly worth a watch and you may take one or two things from it and be it only that your own family doesn't seem all that messed up anymore when the credits roll in.",August - Osage County
4,Prismark10,"Hot August, rural Oklahoma",3,10 February 2014,"This is a brooding, searing, almost hysterical Tennessee Williams Southern drama with some bitter, twisted characters.There is hysterical overacting by Meryl Streep. Julia Roberts almost matches her in the overacting stakes.The film is billed as a black comedy/drama, an adaptation of a stage play and directed by John Wells who wrote and directed many episodes of ER.The ensemble cast also includes Sam Shepard, Ewan McGregor, Chris Cooper, Juliette Lewis and Benedict CumberbatchSteep plays a bitter, sick, cancer ridden, drug addict whose drunk, poet husband hires a native American to cook and look after his wife and shortly later dies.The rest of the family arrives and what follows are brutal arguments where ghosts of the past are brought out in the open and wounds are opened up and laid to fester.However despite this the film is dull, overacted and certainly not funny. It does not even resemble a dark comedy.The film is certainly aimed at a female audience but it's interesting to note that it is the men who come out as more mature and sensible in this film.We get more understated performances from Shepard, Cooper and McGregor and even Cumberbatch makes the most of his small role.",August - Osage County
5,mark.waltz,Weddings and funerals bring out the best in SOME families.,7,27 May 2016,"Three generations of a very estranged family gather together for the patriarch's funeral, which if I were a member of, would probably skip without apologies or an explanation. Don't let the surface friendliness of the characters in this clan fool you. They are all completely nuts.Matriarch Meryl Street makes Violet's Voice, which is basically pill addiction, and only mourning her husband for a minute before going on the attack. She's basically run daughter Julia Roberts off (by Robert's obvious choice), and it is ultra difficult for Roberts to return. The funeral is followed by a memorial dinner that makes a visit with George and Martha a day at the beach. The always powerful Streep adds another classic portrayal to her dozens of magnificent roles. Violet is a woman filled with anger and bitterness towards her three children, and it's obviously isn't grief talking. Secrets are revealed, old hurts are raised, yet biscuits with gravy are consumed without one being thrown.Among the others in this amazing ensemble are Margo Martindale as Streep's loyal but sometimes bluntly obnoxious sister, Chuck Cooper as her quietly suffering husband, and Juliette Lewis as the wild, party girl baby in the family. All eyes are on Streep however, as it was for me on Broadway when I saw Estelle Parsons in the role. Smartly edited by over an hour, this may not have been as fast moving as the play was. Tracy Letts wrote the best drama we've seen on stage in decades, and as my tagline says, Outstanding theater may make you weep. The movie may not have had the same effect, but I never was bored, that's for sure.",August - Osage County
6,nogodnomasters,LIFE IS TOO LONG,10,11 April 2019,"Beverly (Sam Shepard) is a drinker and poet. He is married to Violet (Meryl Streep) a smoker with mouth cancer and pill addict. Beverly hires a person (Misty Upham) to take care of Violet because sadly he knows his daughters won't. After his suicide, Violet's three daughters and sister (Margo Martindale) come to her home. Violet is pill drunk, yet incredibly astute as to what is happening. The daughters all have their own issues as they strive to make a mess of their own lives. During this get together, old wounds are opened, new ones created, and secrets revealed.If the goal of the film is to make the audience feel uncomfortable, this one succeeds as much as ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" Indeed I imagined the director viewing the audience wringing his hands as they squirm in their seats. This is not a feel good film, and indeed, I have family of four cats (mother with 3 daughters) that get along better than this dysfunctional family.The production is well acted. I was glued to the screen as I watched a tragedy unfold as Barbara (Julia Roberts) turns into her mother.Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",August - Osage County
7,kosmasp,The key is in the past,9,3 August 2014,"Just looking at that cast list is exceptional. To get that many good people to do one movie is a feat, but the script was there (based on a novel obviously, that I haven't read, so I can't comment on that). Everyone of the people involved does have a key element to play, and while it might be predictable at times, it still is very good.The key to our future or even our present lies in the past. And breaking out of things we went through as kids is not done easily. While this movie mostly plays at one location, it really takes a lot in from that location (history that is). There is no clear ""villain"" in that sense (even if Streep has to struggle and might be connected most with that attribute), but a lot of grey areas and a lot of things being discovered ... not always a good thing, but good to watch",August - Osage County
8,classicsoncall,"""Thank God we can't tell the future. We'd never get out of bed"".",9,25 October 2014,"Wow, and you thought YOUR family was dysfunctional! The ensemble cast in this movie delivers one of the most powerful screen performances you're likely to see, and it's not at all pretty. Meryl Streep as the drug addled matriarch of the Weston family delivers one of her finest performances ever. She's backed up by the sizzling anti-chemistry of Julia Roberts, Julianne Nicholson and Juliette Lewis as Violet Weston's daughters, attempting to cope with the suicide of their father and the building turmoil in their own personal lives.Individually, it's easy enough to identify with most any of the principal players here, but nothing will prepare you for the main event that plays out at the dinner table when Ma Weston goes on her truth-telling jag. It's vicious and it's mean, and when Barbara Weston (Roberts) declares that she's now in charge, it sets up a new dynamic in the story that still leaves plenty of uncomfortable disclosures to be revealed. It's as if you could feel the hundred and eight degree temperature of the Oklahoma Plains searing through the screen to burn an indelible memory of the Weston's into your skull.I could go on I guess, but words alone can't convey the impact of the story here. Deep and dark secrets unnerve the viewer at various points of the story, and just as you figure that things will go one way, they're suddenly upended to go another. It's like the 'boots for Christmas' story that Violet Weston told about her own mother; just when you think you're about to get a happy ending, the rug is pulled out from under you once more.",August - Osage County
9,jboothmillard,August: Osage County,6,17 February 2014,"I always say to myself I will see all films nominated during awards season, this was only nominated a few, and despite seeing a good trailer for it I was perhaps unsure because of the rating critics gave it, but I decided to go for it in the end. Basically, during an unusually hot summer in the month of August, in rural Osage County outside Pawhuska, Oklahoma, once-noted alcoholic poet Beverly Weston (Sam Shepard) is looking for a live-in cook and caregiver for his strong-willed and quarrelsome wife Violet (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Meryl Streep) who is suffering from mouth cancer, going through chemotherapy and addicted to narcotics. Shortly after young native American woman Johnna Monevata (Misty Upham) is chosen by him, Beverly disappears, and after five days he is found drowned, he took his boat out onto the lake and committed suicide, Violet identifies the body and has to make funeral arrangements, a few days earlier she did call on her sister and daughters for support, and this means the entire family will be united for the sad occasion. Violet's sister Mattie Fae Aiken (Orphan's Margo Martindale) comes with husband Charlie Aiken (Chris Cooper), Violet's youngest daughter Ivy (Julianne Nicholson) is single and the only family living close, Violet's oldest daughter Barbara (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Julia Roberts) who has inherited her mean side comes from Colorado with husband Bill Fordham (Ewan McGregor), they are separated due to having marriage difficulties, and their fourteen year old daughter Jean (Abigail Breslin), and Violer's middle daughter Karen (Juliette Lewis) is bringing the latest of a string of boyfriends, sleazy Florida businessman Steve Huberbrecht (Dermot Mulroney) who is apparently her fiancé. The family member who misses the funeral due to oversleeping is Little Charles Aiken (Benedict Cumberbatch), father Charles picks him up from the bus stop to join the dinner back at the house, he loves his son while mother Mattie thinks of him as a loser, also Ivy expresses her love for Little Charles to Barbara, but it is sad that she cannot bare children due to having a hysterectomy. The family all sit together for an awkward dinner to share in the memory of Beverly, but Violet in her inebriated state turns it into a terrible ""truth telling"", with Barbara getting agitated and exposing the drug addiction her mother has, and trying to wrestle her pills from her, but Violet sobers up, and after all the pills have been washed away does have a tender moment with her daughters, revealing she probably gained her cruel streak from her own mother. Jean is almost being seduced by Steve who is giving her his stash of marijuana, Johnna catches them and assumes something more going on, chasing him with a shovel, Barbara gets angry and smacks her daughter, this prompts Bill to take Jean with him back to Colorado, Barbara is left behind because she feels there is still somewhere to go towards making up with her mother, but a divorce will most likely happen now, and Karen realises Steve is not the right man for her. Little Charles and Ivy are close with each other again, and Mattie walks in and cusses him again, father Charles has had enough of her constant putting down of their son and angrily says he will leave with or without her, in a private conversation with Barbara she reveals a big truth, Mattie had an affair with Mattie, so Little Charles is in fact his son and Ivy's brother, so Barbara knows she has to somehow stop them marrying each other. Violet is still using pills that Barbara was unable to find, and at the table Ivy tries to tell her mother about the love she has for Little Charles, Barbara tries to stop her, but Violet interrupts them both assuming she is telling the truth about him being Beverly's son and blurts this truth, she has known for years, Ivy highly upset drives away and angrily telling she will never return. In a last angry discussion between Violet and Barbara the mother admits that Beverly contacted him before he died, but she did nothing to help him and removed the money from their joint account, and she was too late after doing this, and this is the final straw for Barbara who drives away in a pickup truck, she does stop to have a think, while Violet is left alone with only Johnna for comfort. Also starring Will Coffey as Sheriff Deon Gilbeau and Newell Alexander as Dr. Burke. Streep is fantastic a pill addicted queen bitch head of the family, Roberts is also fantastic as the equally bitchy and snappy eldest daughter, in the heated argument scenes there are plenty of fireworks between them, they both absolutely deserved Oscar nominations, but all of the cast members add something as well, McGregor being easily irritated, Cooper being kind-hearted, Breslin being a rebel teenager, Cumberbatch being good- natured, and Lewis being annoying and talkative. This film is based on a stage play, so this obviously relies on really well written dialogue and great performances, the dysfunctional family issues of abuse, infidelities and incest certainly make an impact, and I really laughed at the put downs and interesting character traits, I agree maybe it is a little over-baked at times, but it made me laugh and compelled in equal measure, this is absolutely a most watchable comedy drama. Good!",August - Osage County
10,blanche-2,a sick bunch gathers to mourn a family member,10,18 November 2013,"""August: Osage County"" is a stunning, powerful play written by Tracy Letts - it rocked Broadway and won the Pulitzer Prize. And it's going to rock a movie theater near you. This isn't a movie for everyone. It's exhausting, it's full of really despicable people, and it's mighty depressing. But the acting is so terrific, the roles so strong, that you don't want to miss it.It's the story of the Weston family: Violet, a drug-addicted cancer patient (Meryl Streep); her husband Beverley, a well-known poet (Sam Shepard); their daughters Barbara (Julia Roberts), Karen (Juliette Lewis), and Ivy (Julianne Nicholson); Violet's sister Minnie Fae Aiken (Margo Martindale), her husband Charles (Chris Cooper), and their son, known as Little Charles (Benedict Cumberbatch).When Beverley commits suicide, the family gathers and it's wretched from the beginning. Violet is totally drugged, Barbara and her husband (Ewan McGregor) are in the process of breaking up, Ivy has a secret boyfriend and, though she stayed behind and has been caring for her mother, she's ready to leave for New York, and Karen arrives with her fiancée (Dermot Mulroney) who has been married three times and seems a little too interested in Barbara's 14-year-old daughter. When Little Charles arrives on a later bus than he was supposed to take, his mother belittles him in front of everyone. Little Charles is considered a not so little loser, and is the only likable one in the film.Each daughter has reacted differently to having parents like Violet and Beverley. Barbara is hard and tough like her mother, Ivy keeps her feelings and desires to herself, and Karen is a dingbat looking for love, probably in all the wrong places. The Aiken dynamic - obviously Violet and Minnie were forced to grow up to be as tough and mean as possible in order to survive; Charles is quiet with a fury underneath, and Little Charles looks like he's going to break in two any minute. He shares the same secret as Ivy: they're in love and planning to go away together.This is a grueling story of the destructive force of addiction, the danger of anger, the hurt of betrayal, and the pain caused by keeping secrets.I was not fortunate enough to see the Broadway play so I can't compare the performances. I thought Meryl Streep was terrific - it's the kind of role actresses love, a sort of Martha in Virgina Woolf gone completely haywire, and except for Helen Mirren and Judy Dench, there's no one better to tackle it than Streep. Julia Roberts gives what is probably her best performance. She's not a favorite of mine, and I don't find her a particularly good actress, but she almost pulls this off, probably because of the talent surrounding her. Margo Martindale as the caustic and bitter Minnie, who reminds her niece that she's not just her ""fat old aunt"" is sensational. Violet, Barbara and Minnie have the showiest roles.In the male roles, Sam Shepard, though his role is small, is elegant and sympathetic, and Chris Cooper doesn't have much to do until a showdown with Minnie, which is galvanizing. And Benedict Cumberbatch - what can I say - I adore the man. He's a nasty villain in Star Trek and here, an insecure young man who hates himself for his tardiness and inability to keep a job. He's heartbreaking. He can do anything and he proves it here as he sings -- yes, sings! -- to Ivy.Your family, no matter the problems, will look like Leave it to Beaver after you see this film. See it - enjoy the fabulous acting and be grateful that you're not going home to anything like it. I hope.",August - Osage County
11,tavm,Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts and cast perform well enough in August: Osage County,9,1 February 2014,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. He had watched it before but I hadn't so many of the revelations here really surprised me especially when it was revealed that someone the Julianne Nicholson character was involved with was not what she knew initially. Meryl Streep gave another outstanding performance and Julia Roberts matches her in emotion and attitude. Pretty much the rest of the cast were fine in their performances and characterizations. For those who are reading this not having seen the movie, I'll just say that the family gets together for a funeral and start airing some grievances which results in some revelations that changes some dynamics for possibly forever. Really, all I'll now say is I highly recommend August: Osage County.",August - Osage County
12,edwagreen,Dysfunction At its Best ****,10,8 November 2014,"Meryl Streep turned in another phenomenal performance as a drug addicted mother within a most dysfunctional family. She is equally matched here by Julia Roberts, who really turned in one of her best performances as one of her daughters, with a head on her shoulders but seeing her marriage fall apart.The dynamics here of a brooding family caught up in the apparent suicide of Sam Shepard, who portrays Streep's husband in the film.There is a memorable funeral dinner scene where the family really lets itself go. Incestuous relationships abound here as the sisters practically feed off one another.Streep appears to be a survivor here. Whether she is totally abandoned by film's end remains a question to be answered.",August - Osage County
13,michaelRokeefe,Grief and dysfunction of an Oklahoma family.,6,25 August 2014,"Set in Oklahoma, filmed in Oklahoma, written by an Oklahoman; and as a life-long Oklahoman, I say ""Big whoopy-do!"" Written by Tracy Letts based on his Pulitzer Prize winning play, AUGUST:OSAGE COUNTY stars an ensemble cast showing various degrees of talent. If you are not depressed when the credits roll, you will be totally in an agitated mood as the ending credits roll. Dysfunction piled on top of dysfunction. When their father, Beverly Weston(Sam Shepard), once-noted poet and self acclaimed alcoholic, disappears, three strong willed sisters return to their childhood home near rural Pawhuska, Oklahoma. Ruling the homestead is their mother, Violet(Meryl Streep), suffering from oral cancer and dependent to the hilt on pain killing narcotics. Sisters Barbara(Julia Roberts), Karen(Juliette Lewis) and Ivy(Julianne Nicholson)find it hard enough dealing with their rude, crude and mean-spirited mother; when it is discovered that the family patriarch has actually committed suicide, there is plenty of sorrow, blame and finger pointing to go around. When the immediate family gathers for the post funeral dinner, hell breaks loose and Violet's drug induced ""truth telling"" starts a round robin of family dysfunction and destruction with the airing of dirty little secrets. Family members find it hard to face up to their personal transgressions.The scenes shared by Streep and Roberts seemed so awkward and forced. Streep, of course, owns her role and is outstanding. Roberts, on the other hand, struggles. Miserably miscast is Benedict Cumberbatch as the mentally challenged Little Charles. Nicholson's talents are overlooked. Rounding out the cast: Chris Cooper, Margo Martindale, Abigail Breslin, Ewan McGregor and Dermot Mulroney. And Misty Upham is notable as the hired help, Johnna.",August - Osage County
14,sunwarrior13,An Acting Extravaganza,10,13 April 2014,"August: Osage County is a black comedy-drama written by Tracy Letts that was based on his Pulitzer Prize–winning play of the same title.The ensemble cast is led by Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts together with Ewan McGregor, Chris Cooper, Abigail Breslin, Juliette Lewis,Margo Martindale,Dermot Mulroney,Julianne Nicholson and Sam Shepard.This film features tells a touching story of the strong-willed women of the Weston family.They get together when a member of the family passed away.During the gathering,we get to see verbal sparring among family members and we get to realize how the dysfunction among each one of them.This happens particularly in an awkward dinner Violet's starts a conversation among each member of the family which she calls ""truth telling"".It results with Barbara jumping at her mother.Later in the movie,we learn more about secrets and character flaws that each member possesses.This film would probably still work better on stage than on screen.Too bad that Tracy Letts did not make the necessary adjustments to make it suit as a film feature.The story does not offer that much as nothing much goes on in it.Also,the viewer would probably not care for each dysfunctional character in the film as the writer does not provide a variety of reasons to do so.But inspite of the flaws that I have stated about it,what makes this film stand out is the fact that we are definitely treated to an acting extravaganza from a talented ensemble cast.We get to see three-time Oscar winner Meryl Streep surely put her A game as always portraying the spiteful and hateful Violet Weston.And of course,we Julia Roberts show a great performance as Violet's daugther,Barbara Weston.This is probably one of the best I have seen her since winning an Oscar in Erin Brokovich.No wonder both got a well-deserved Academy Award nominations.As for the rest of the cast,they do not disappoint as well.The actors and actresses involved brought in their acting chops to make their dysfunctional characters interesting and worth watching.In summary,see the film not to get entertained nor to get to see a great story but for overwhelming acting talent involved in it.",August - Osage County
15,Scarecrow-88,August: Osage County,7,11 January 2015,"Movies about dysfunctional families are not easy to watch. But some of the best acting showcases come from them and the ensemble in ""August: Osage County"" certainly has one hell of a cast. Julia Roberts hasn't had a part like this since maybe ""Erin Brockovich"" as a bitter daughter caught in a marriage on its way to a divorce thanks to her cheating husband (Ewan McGregor), returning to her Oklahoma homestead after her father (Sam Shepard) commits suicide through drowning. Meryl Streep is the matriarch so doped on pills with a brain deterioration due to their abuse she has no restraint towards what harsh insults spews from her malignant mouth. The toxic environment produces a lot of shouting, ill will, hurt, and emotional damage that may never mend the family members again. Shepard's suicide, Streep's significant running faucet of noxious nastiness, Roberts' combative reaction that had been building over the years towards Streep (the film establishes that she is in many ways similar to her mom in personality and attitude), Juliette Lewis' youngest daughter and her inability to choose a decent man (she does try and try to treat her sisters and mother as sweet as she can), Dermot Mulroney as a thrice-married creep Lewis is engaged to (he basically tries to seduce the fourteen year old daughter of Roberts, with the resulting slap to Abigail Breslin inducing McGregor to leave, admitting he might not return to Roberts and the marriage), Margo Martindale as Streep's sister and confidante with a secret involving her not-so-bright son played by the brilliant Benedict Cumberpatch, the fantastic Chris Cooper as Martindale's husband of 38 years who doesn't have the stomach for her berating ridicule towards Cumberpatch any longer, and Julianne Nicholson as the spinster middle daughter who has remained nearby Streep (and withstood her rough edge and assertive negativity) for her entire life. While Nicholson and Cumberpatch wish to leave Okie for NYC, a secret regarding an affair could halt those plans. Roberts and Streep's chaotic rants towards each other are the melodramatic fireworks of the film and seeing them together on screen should give many movie fans an orgasm. But Nicholson and Lewis hold their own, as well as, the always damn good Martindale who continues to take small roles and knock them out of the park. Cooper's defense of Cumberpatch against Martindale really earns him some brownie points as does his attempts during the ""after funeral dinner party from hell"" to ease the ensuing hurricane of vitriol building around the table. That Roberts and Streep eventually fall to the floor in a battle for pills as the relatives herd towards them to try and separate them tells you all you need to know about how this family is on the verge of ruination. Streep's declining health and pills addictions are in and of themselves rather difficult to watch, but the temper tantrums and volatility sure doesn't help matters. They used to make these showcases all the time with Katherine Hepburn and Elizabeth Taylor (and a collection of fine actors along with them), with ""August: Osage County"" follows suit, as the typical hurt feelings and broken hearts result. Nothing about this is life affirming but seeing Roberts drive away to an uncertain future with a smile and sense of hope for that great unknown. Streep being left all alone after spilling the beans to Nicholson about Cumberpatch while Roberts tries to keep the secret concealed is a sad indictment of a mother's final adieu to any remaining relationship with her daughters. Streep loses herself in the part of a loose-lipped, prone-to-histrionics, acid-tongued mother with no filter and seemingly little guilt in how her words and behavior stings and crushes those around her. That Roberts can match her punch for punch is impressive. It this were expanded (the movie adaptation was truncated somewhat from the play), perhaps the supporting parts might have been more substantial (McGregor and Mulroney neither really have much to work with after the infamous dinner table scene).",August - Osage County
16,LeonLouisRicci,All Out All Star Cast In Seamless Soap,8,12 April 2014,"It is Ironic that a Movie based on a Play that is Completely Dialog Driven that there are No Memorable or Quotable Lines that Remain Afterwards like the Red Stinging Hump of a Mosquito Bite. The Anesthetic that the Insect Uses while Sucking the Blood Dissipates and it is only then that the Fact that You have been Violated is Painfully Apparent. Here the Anesthetic Never Dissipates and the Numbness keeps the Audience in a Stupor for the Length of the Film and Perhaps Afterwards. Or it may just be that the Acting is so Seamless, the Writing so Acidic, and the Direction so Unobtrusive that this Whole Dysfunctional Display is Genius.But like All Genius, it Requires some Tolerance because After All Genius is Rare and Important so it is to be Treated with a Certain Respect. This is a Hard Film to Watch but it is Hardly Worthless. it is an Antithesis of the Much Talked About Openly but Practiced Infrequently, that Badge of Honor called Christian Family Values. That Fantasy Land of Hopeful but Unattainable Perfection of Goodness (cue Martha Stewart). The is the Anti-Christ of Relationships. It is not an Attractive Thing and is Therefore Mostly Hidden from Polite Society and is Only on Display behind Closed Doors.

17,writers_reign,Oklahoma KO,8,28 January 2014,"Like the man (Tolstoy) said, all happy families are happy in the same way, all unhappy families are unhappy in different ways; you sure got that one right, Lev, old son. Although I haven't seen the play I am aware that it is only around six years old and I can't help wondering if there were really so many characters on stage as there are on screen, given that modern producers prefer plays with five characters and one set. That being said this has all the earmarks of a multi-nomination Oscar movie; Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Best Screenplay, Best Film, Best Director; which is all very well but in the interests of the way things are we need to add Best Budget, because the REAL Best film was Short Term:2 which was made for a stick of gum so that no one who matters is going to see it and it will fall of the radar if it hasn't already. It's a given that Meryl Streep is a word-class actress but her role, Violet, the matriarch of a dysfunctional family is so well-written that even Joan Rivers or Pamela Anderson could play it. The real best actress here is Julia Roberts, looking like s**t and acting everyone off the screen and if you're looking for Best Supporting actress look no further than her aunt and sister Ivy. Abigail Breslin contrives to look uncannily like Susan Strasberg in Picnic and even has the same kind of role, intense teenager reading above her weight (in Picnic Strasberg was reading The Ballad Of The Sad Café, and a nice touch here has Roberts saying this isn't Carson McCullers. If it's great acting - both individual and ensemble that lights your fire look no further.",August - Osage County
18,grantss,Engaging drama driven by powerful performances,8,28 March 2015,"Engaging drama driven by powerful performances.The story of three sisters and their mother reunited for the first time in many years, due to a family tragedy. From the start you realise that frictions exist between parts of the family. Moreover, secrets exist too...Good plot, with some interesting twists and turns along the way. Maybe overdoes the melodrama at times, but it makes for riveting viewing. Ending feels a bit tame though, especially after what preceded it.Superb performances from an all-star cast. Meryl Streep got her annual Oscar nomination for this performance, and deserved it (as she did all her Oscar nominations). However, it is Julia Roberts who steals the show with an intense performance. Her Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination was also well-deserved.",August - Osage County

While embed with a game, blue-chip cast including Roberts in a fierce turn as the favorite daughter the film suffers in the fact that there are very few characters to care for let alone like in one-up- gamesmanship of who can be more socially repugnant.

21,neil-476,"Terrific cast and acting, but you (mostly) don't care",7,14 February 2014,"Beverly Western has died and his family gathers for his funeral. At the meal following, it becomes clear how dysfunctional the family is, and you get some idea of why.This film, screenwritten from his own play by Tracy Letts, is a drama despite the fact that the trailer gives the impression that it is humorous. There is humour in it, but not very much. The cast is absolutely stellar, and all are at the top of their game. The problem is that the characters they are playing are all so unlikeable, and what happens during the movie is so purposeless, that there is nothing to engage you emotionally, and at the end of the film, despite all the high drama, you are left with a profound feeling of ""So what?""There is one shining exception to this, and that is the point - spoiler - when Meryl Streep reveals a secret to Julianne Nicholson. That is absolutely heartbreaking, and had me in tears. Otherwise, this is a fairly cold-blooded exercise in unpleasant histrionics.Megaspoiler discussion point: I wonder if that particular point is in order to deliver a punishment for incest? Otherwise, given that procreation is not an issue and neither of the characters involved is aware of the revelation, the compassionate thing to do would be to just let them get on with it, surely? Conversely, given that the hysterectomy hasn't been mentioned, I suppose there is no reason for Meryl Streep to know that procreation is irrelevant. Whatever, the way this plot thread played out was the strongest point in the film.",August - Osage County
22,evanston_dad,One Big Happy Family,5,7 February 2014,"As Tolstoy said, ""All happy families are alike, and all unhappy families are unhappy in their own individual way"" (or something to that effect).Well the Westons are unhappy in the way common to all of those Southern Gothic families created by Tennessee Williams and Eugene O'Neill in the heyday of American theatre. Unfortunately, that's a problem for ""August: Osage County,"" since it always feels like warmed over Williams or O'Neill rather than something coming from an original and modern theatrical voice.Perhaps that's not a problem with the material on stage. I've not seen the play, though I live in Chicago where Tracy Letts' drama (he also wrote the film's screenplay) originated at the Steppenwolf Theatre, and could kick myself for not seeing it when I had the chance. But film is notorious for revealing the flimsiness of a lot of stage material when it's not handled correctly, and the same is true here. A cast of wonderful actors, led by the likes of Meryl Streep, Julia Roberts, Chris Cooper, Margo Martindale, Juliette Lewis, Ewan McGregor and Sam Shepard, commit themselves fully to the material they're given, rage and storm and shout and bluster accordingly, but it all adds up to not much.I think much of the problem is with the directing and editing. Many moments that I'm sure were BIG moments on stage are swallowed up on screen, particularly Roberts's big line, ""I'm running things now!!"" which I've heard on stage was a showstopper but on screen comes and goes without notice due to the fast cutting away from Roberts just when she's finished saying it. But I think some of the problems are with the script itself. This family's secrets and revelations are all things we've seen and heard before, and they're not presented in a way that makes them feel new, and we're not given much reason to care about any of it in any case.Streep and Roberts have gotten the acclaim (and obligatory Oscar nominations) for their performances. In my opinion, Streep is, for once, upstaged by her co-star; Roberts is probably the best she's ever been, while Streep chews scenery like she doesn't know where her next meal is coming from. But for me the standouts were Cooper and Martindale, who are able to deliver Letts' material like it matters.Grade: B-",August - Osage County
23,ferguson-6,Eat your Fish,6,12 January 2014,"Greetings again from the darkness. Tracy Letts had a very nice year in 2008. He won the Pulitzer Prize and a Tony for writing the play August: Osage County. Since then, he has also written the play and screenplay for Killer Joe, and been seen as an actor in the key role of a Senator in the TV show ""Homeland"". This time out, he adapts his own play for director John Wells' (The Company Men, TV's ""ER"") screen version of August: Osage County.With an ensemble cast matched by very few movies over the years, the screen version begins with what may be its best scene. Weston family patriarch and published poet Beverly (the always great Sam Shepard) is interviewing Johnna for a position as cook and housekeeper when they are interrupted in stunning fashion by Violet (Meryl Streep), Beverly's acid-tongued wife who is showing the effects of chemotherapy and her prescription drug addiction. This extraordinary pre-credits scene sets the stage for the entire movie, which unfortunately only approaches this high standard a couple more times.Despite the film's flaws, there is no denying the ""train-wreck"" effect of not being able to look away from this most dysfunctional family. Most of this is due to the screen presence of a steady stream of talented actors: in addition to Streep and Shephard, we get their 3 daughters played by Julia Roberts (Barbara), Julianne Nicholson (Ivy) and Juliette Lewis (Karen); Ewan McGregor and Abigail Breslin as Roberts' husband and daughter; Margo Martindale (Violet's sister), her husband Chris Cooper (Charles) and their son Benedict Cumberbatch.As with most dysfunctional family movies, there is a dinner table scene ... this one occurring after a funeral. The resentment and regret and anger on display over casseroles is staggering, especially the incisive and ""truth-telling"" Violet comments and the defensive replies from Barbara. As time goes on, family secrets and stories unfold culminating in a whopper near the end. This is really the polar opposite of a family support system.Meryl Streep's performance is one of the most demonstrative of her career. Some may call it over the top, but I believe it's essential to the tone of the movie and the family interactions. Her exchanges with Julia Roberts define the monster mother and daughter in her image theme. They don't nitpick each other, it's more like inflicting gaping wounds. Surprisingly, Roberts mostly holds her own ... though that could be that the film borders on campy much of the time. Streep's scene comes as she recalls the most horrific childhood Christmas story you could ever want to hear.It must be noted that Margo Martindale is the real highlight here. She has two extraordinary scenes ... each very different in style and substance ... and she nails them both. Without her character and talent, this film could have spun off into a major mess. The same could be said for Chris Cooper, who is really the moral center of the family. While the others seem intent on hiding from their past, he seems to make the best of his situation.The film never really captures the conflicting environments of the old Weston homestead and the wide open plains of Oklahoma. The exception is a pretty cool post-funeral scene in a hayfield where Roberts tells Streep ""There's no place to go"". The main difference between the film version and stage version is the compressed time and the decision to include all explosive scenes. There is just little breathing room here. Still, it's one of the more entertaining and wild dysfunctional comedy-dramas that you will see on screen, and it's quite obvious this group of fine actors thoroughly enjoyed the ensemble experience.",August - Osage County
24,anaconda-40658,Streep's County.,7,24 September 2015,"August: Osage County (2013): Dir: John Wells / Cast: Meryl Streep, Julia Roberts, Julianne Nicholson, Juliette Lewis, Benedict Cumberbatch: This is Family Feud in overdrive as one family comes together after the drowning death of Beverly Weston. In the opening he hires a Native American woman to care for his wife Violet who suffers from mouth cancer and is on a constant high on pills. This becomes overwhelming as the structure compiles way too many subplots as each character seems eager to reveal some skeleton in the closet. What we are left with is a broken home filled with broken dreams and relationships leaving only that loyal Native American caregiver to indicate any form of sympathy or understanding. Director John Wells assembles a strong cast that render this travesty better than it might have been without them. Meryl Streep is often amusing playing a pilled up widow whose condition doesn't sway reality or the attacks at the dinner table that she issues to everyone. Julia Roberts is equally terrific counter arguing Streep. She plays oldest daughter Barbara, separated from her husband and has a pot smoking rebellious daughter. Julianne Nicholson plays Ivy who reveals a relationship with her first cousin although damaging truth arise from this. Juliette Lewis plays middle daughter up from Miami with a douche of a boyfriend. Benedict Cumberbatch plays a family member caught up in a forbidden relationship and sheltered facts. While extremely overwhelming and sometimes depressing it does address brokenness within families where functions can evaporate into more broken memories. Score: 7 / 10",August - Osage County

Dermot Mulroney, although dating Juliette Lewis, is noticing the curves on her niece. Benedict Cumberbatch isn't all there mentally, and he's having an incestuous relationship with his cousin, Julianne Nicholson. Margo Martindale, and her husband Chris Cooper also have marital difficulties and disagree on how to handle their son.

28,zetes,"I have a lot of mixed feelings about this movie, but overall I liked it and it was worth seeing",7,19 January 2014,"This is one I wasn't looking forward to at all. I wanted to hate it. I did not, though. I enjoyed it, but there's still a part of me that kind of hates it. It's so overwrought, overwritten and overacted. Tracy Letts's play will be remarkably insightful on the human condition one moment, then turn around the next moment with some ridiculous, soap opera-y plot twist. While the script/play attempts to prove it's brilliant, no one cares. This is mostly just a showcase for actors. They are mostly good, though completely histrionic in many cases. Streep is the worst, of course, but she does have the most overwritten role. Her worst moments are those when she dances crazily - she's really awful there. But I did like her big scenes at the dinner table. No, Streep does not deserve another Oscar nomination for this stuff, but at least it's better than her recent winning role. Her scene in the car with Julia Roberts is the best scene in the movie. Roberts herself is definitely one of the best actors in the movie. It's her best in a long time. The best actor in the film is Margo Martindale as Streep's sister. Great casting, but she just brings a lot to it. Chris Cooper is also excellent as her husband, and their big scene together is about equal to the car scene I mentioned earlier. Also really liked Sam Shepard and Julianne Nicholson. Had mixed feelings on Juliette Lewis (liked her last scene a lot) and Dermot Mulroney (who has the misfortune to play a character who is an incredible scumbag - ""incredible"" meaning not believable). Ewan MacGregor, Abigail Breslin and Misty Upham are all fine but don't have a ton to do. Worst of the cast is Benedict Cumberbatch. MacGregor has never been able to produce an American accent, but Cumberbatch will never not look like an inbred royal to me. His name certainly doesn't help, either. But he never convinces that he could be an American, let alone a Southerner. I definitely sound like I hated it, but I actually found it pretty entertaining.",August - Osage County

I had read the play prior so I knew the surprises but it didn't take away from the play. The film does justice to the story even with forty minutes edited out of time. The film casting here is perfect but I wonder what the original cast would have added to the film adaptation. While Meryl and Julia earned their nominations, I felt that Deanna Dunagan and Amy Morton deserved their chance on the big screen as Violet and Barbara. Margo Martindale did a fine job as Mattie Fae but Rondi Reed would have been the original. While the film stays true to the story, Meryl is believable as the toxic Violet Weston. Julia Roberts has matured as an actress and can stand in a scene with Streep or anybody else. The film and stage version is not for immature audiences as the writer touches on sensitive subjects. The stage production featured a three story set where it can be difficult for a community theater. The film doesn't need to worry about that issue.

Benedict Cumberbatch is the surprise here, playing a stammering wimp. But the whole family tree is rooted in dysfunction; secrets are uncovered that are nothing short of heartbreaking. And it's not easy to witness such spite, but these are certainly well-rounded characters who make such a trial worthwhile.Like I said, it's rough, but the journey's worth it.

33,StevePulaski,"Together again, unnaturally",10,29 January 2014,"August: Osage County's central message, essentially, is if you're a female and a member of the Weston dynasty, you damn-well better have a thick skin and a strong will because you're going to be torn apart and broken a whole lot, often times by your own mother, who is battling mouth cancer and narcotic-dependency. Here is the kind of film that may give you optimism if you think your family is dysfunctional, but, if you're willing to appreciate a display of tremendous acting and strong monologues about family, reliance on others in a time of need, and personal problems, the film is as great as they come.To get the abundance of actors and characters out of the way, the story takes place during a miserably hot August in Pawhuska, Oklahoma and begins with Beverly Weston (Sam Shepard) interviewing a Native American woman as a housekeeper. Right then and there, we are introduced to him and his wife Violent (Meryl Streep), the aforementioned cancer-sufferer. Not long after the two fight in front of the poor woman, Beverly disappears and the entire Weston dynasty is called in a time of uncertainty. Time for role call: Mattie Fae (Margo Martindale), Violet's sister, arrives with husband Charles (Chris Cooper). Violet's youngest daughter Ivy (Julianne Nicholson) is without a spouse and lives nearby, whereas Barbara (Julia Roberts), her oldest, travels from Colorado with her husband Bill (Ewan McGregor) and 14-year-old daughter Jean (Abigail Breslin), despite marital problems amongst the two. Then there's the middle-child, Karen (Juliette Lewis) who comes with Steve (Dermot Mulroney), another one of her boyfriends who she now calls his fiancée (to which he calls his upcoming fourth marriage). Not long after, Mattie Fae and Charles' awkward son ""Little Charles"" (Benedict Cumberbatch) joins the brigade, as well.In a time of grief and uncertainty, this dysfunctional family gets together to try and sort things out amongst themselves, and after heart-shattering news, plan a funeral despite many of them not seeing each other in a number of years. Writer Tracy Letts (who wrote last year's intense and unforgettable Killer Joe) smartly allows the film to be character-heavy, rather than plot-heavy, and doesn't hesitate to keep the film grounded in its play-roots. There's no need for theatricalities; some of the best play-to-movie adaptations (Roman Polanski's Carnage, David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross) are such greats because they allowed themselves to be a play-on-screen and didn't feel the need to turn their stories into a particular cacophony of theatrics or set-pieces. What we get is a film that takes place largely in one setting (the family's childhood, old-fashioned Oklahoma home) and several characters that are trying to be good people in the long-run.Each character gets their own time to shine, from the matriarch Violet, whose drug addiction will eventually find its way to the forefront of the story, right down to precocious little Jean, who is frowned upon for being so grown up by her mother Barbara. Barbara, whether or not she'd like to admit, has become much like her mother, a domineering, often unnecessarily argumentative firecracker with a short fuse. She will be the one that will ultimately handle her mother's fierce addiction to painkillers and downers, while simultaneously struggling to keep her own marriage with Bill alive in the face of a separation. Then between Barbara's potential separation, Karen's umpteenth boyfriend, and Ivy's singleness, we get to hear how in Violet's day a man needed a woman and people stayed with who they began with and there was scarce talk of divorce and cheating.But the real treat here is watching a number of stellar actors do another extravagant job at playing their roles. Because everyone gets their moment, no name too big or too small gets neglected here and everyone is exceptional. It's almost getting to be a cliché in itself to say Meryl Streep knocks her role out of the park but it must be said. She's given, again, a difficult role - a sometimes fiercely unlikable drug addict who's tough-love approach treads the line of tough-hate. However, Wells nor Letts don't really attempt to make her sympathetic; she's a pretty lowly character, after all, but we come to feel for her when we see how bad her addiction really gets in the end. Julia Roberts and Ewan McGregor work so well as a couple too, only elevated in scenes when Abigail Breslin is thrown in the mix, that you wish an entire film could be fixated on their relationship prior to the events of this particular film. Then there's Dermot Mulroney, the actor who finds a way to work himself into everything and always feels in place, Cumberbatch, who has had a year of being quite ubiquitous, and the sure-to-be-neglected Margo Martindale, who manages to work herself to at not being overshadowed by Meryl Streep in a role where the two are frequently on-screen together.August: Osage County is what soap operas aspire to be. The setting screams something you'd see on daytime CBS, but the acting and level of character-interest is cut out for Oscar nominations. This is a film that details the bleakness and the often upsetting problems that can plague a large family like this. Similar to Alexander Payne's Nebraska, the film has the potential to be frighteningly to a certain set of families and because it's a rather mainstream film, with high-profile actors, and a sizable release, it's all the more stunning. This is the kind of film you see on the low-key independent circuit rather than the mainstream one. For such a bleak and often upsetting story, it gives me a stunning amount of optimism that Hollywood may finally have the talent, ambition, and desire to produce strong, family-oriented dramas with a real human focus and a biting twist of black comedy.",August - Osage County

As director John Wells makes a fine showcase to show what it's like being in a family with secrets, and complex anger all centered around strong dysfunctional women. In fact many like me can probably relate many of these characters to some of their own family members. Based on a stage winning play this family drama involves the Weston family of Oklahoma and Violet Weston(the best in the business Meryl Streep)is a set in her ways high strong stubborn old woman getting ready to die of cancer she's in her final days and she's not gonna change her smoking and she's still somewhat of a bigot. And when the unexpected death and tragic passing of her husband happens her three grown daughters arrive to visit the oldest Barbara(in a strong performance from Julia Roberts) is the one that stands in the most with mom as she tells mama how it is about her pill addiction! Then Ivy(Julianne Nicholson) a bruised soul returns only to find a secret that will change her and then the youngest the sexy and outgoing Karen(Juliette Lewis)is off to marry in Florida. Thru it all the arguments and sharp mouths this clan never agrees on anything it's even the small stuff it's family drama at it's best maybe this is why Barbara's husband cheats on her, and even the appearance of Violet's sister Mattie(Margo Martindale)and her husband Charlie(Chris Cooper)adds more flames to the fire as the Weston family is meant to be left with third degree burns of the soul and spirit.

Viewers are strong-armed into unleash our emotional investment to this dysfunctional family embroilment from the very start when patriarch Beverly Weston (Shepard) takes on silent treatment to the acrimonious fit of his cancer-struck, pills-guzzling wife Violet (Streep), in front of the newly-hired Indian helper Johnna (Upham), Streep is fearlessly transformed into a disheveled gorgon and oozes utter antipathy in the short preamble. Soon, Beverly leaves without saying goodbye, which precipitates their oldest daughter Barbara (Roberts) to go back with her separated husband Bill (McGregor) and teenage daughter Jean (Breslin), meanwhile, their unmarried second daughter Ivy (Nicholson), is the one who lives nearby as the parents' caretaker, also lives nearby is the family of Violet's sister Mattie Fae (Martindale), with her husband Charlie (Cooper) and their son Little Charles (Cumberbatch). Later Beverly's body is discovered in a river as the result of a presumed suicide, family gathers together for the funeral (no other alternative to bring each and every family member under the same roof is the painful reality), including their youngest daughter Karen (Lewis) with her new boyfriend Steve (Mulroney). Grippingly, all the conflict is put on the table when Violet viciously verbal-abuses almost everyone during a family dinner, clearly under the influences of whatever drugs she has ingested, the centered dispute between Barbara and Violet breaks out, and secrets are appositely divulged, we become insatiable to dig deeper into each character's back story, because the ensemble is impeccable and females take possession the main stage. Playwright Tracy Letts emanates great eloquence in dissecting the delicacy among siblings, the guilty-steered stratagem and leavening the burdensome reality with cruel honesty as a fatal catalysis, like Violet audaciously remarks in front of her two daughters, ""every parent has his or her favorite child"", when approaching to the end, everyone leaves except Barbara, we begin to think maybe the spite runs in the bloodline, today's Violet is a projection of tomorrow's Barbara, we all resemble our parents in a certain way, but in the Weston Family, there are nothing but damaged goods. Preferably the relieved closing shots betrays a more positive note. Streep is the well-deserved show-stopper, her superlative incarnation of a pretty repulsive character is virtuous, and she doesn't even try to offset the blemishes by making Violet at least a shade sympathetic, plus no one likes a know-it-all. Probably, Streep's presence also spurs the rest of the cast, Roberts, who has been in nadir since she reaches the glass-ceiling age for actresses, is at her best when exerting the fierce confrontation and fully-anticipated outburst, we may all have a soft spot for Ivy, but it is Barbara we are rooting for since the beginning, it is a tough role but can reassure us her bent for a wide range. Both crack into my leading actress race. There is a reshuffle in my supporting actor/actress rank too, Nicholson, Cooper and Martindale are my pick, each establishes his or her distinctive presence in the right moment, Nicholson has the most dramatic twist to exploit, Cooper is mesmerizing in his explosion and Martindale gives a forbidding truth revelation indicates more unspecified anger contrasts to her amiable facade; Lewis is a tricky one, I adore her interpretation of a woman desperately banks on her tiny hope of happiness with an untrustworthy figure, but simultaneously being annoyed by her. Last but not the least, two British heartthrobs are two fish out of water in the all-American environs while Mulroney and Breslin are superfluously forgettable. Two hours fleet through smoothly, but with hind-sights, it is an effective emotion cleansing from an artificially deflated scenario and moderately sanctimonious and histrionic, it is difficult to detect enough quota of sincerity or freshness.",August - Osage County
36,Hellmant,Reminds us all that 'everyone's a freak'!,9,17 January 2014,"'AUGUST: OSAGE COUNTY': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Another of 2013's top Oscar contenders is this dark comedy/family drama film based on the Pulitzer Prize–winning play, of the same name, by Tracy Letts. Letts also wrote the screenplay, as he did for the film adaptations of two of his other popular plays; 'KILLER JOE' and 'BUG'. The previous two films (scripted by Letts) were directed by the great William Friedkin; this movie is directed by John Wells. Wells previously directed the 2010 drama film 'THE COMPANY MEN' (which he also scripted). 'AUGUST: OSAGE COUNTY' stars a huge ensemble cast including Meryl Streep, Julia Roberts, Chris Cooper, Ewan McGregor, Julianne Nicholson, Juliette Lewis, Margo Martindale, Benedict Cumberbatch, Dermot Mulroney, Abigail Breslin and Sam Shepard. It tells the story of a dysfunctional family brought back together when their patriarch dies. Like all of the films based on Letts' plays it's dark, twisted, hilarious and extremely emotional. I'd say if you liked the movies directed by Friedkin you'll like this one as well (although Wells is not quite as good a director obviously).The story is set in Oklahoma during August (which is where the title comes from). When Beverly Weston (Shepard) goes missing his family returns home to Osage County to console his wife, Violet (Streep). Violet has a sister, Mattie Fae Aiken (Martindale), and three daughters: Barbara (Roberts), Ivy (Nicholson) and Karen (Lewis). They all return home with their significant others, except for Ivy (who is single). Ivy is also the only daughter who stayed close to home (in order to help take care of their parents). Barbara is separated from her husband, Bill (McGregor), but they present the illusion that they're still together (for their mother's sake) and bring their teenage daughter, Jean (Breslin), with them as well. Karen brings her fiancé, Steve (Mulroney), and Mattie shows up with her husband, Charlie (Cooper), and their son, Little Charles (Cumberbatch), comes later as well. The family is all saddened to learn that Beverly has passed away and crazy family drama ensues, especially when they learn that Violet is back to her excessive pill-popping ways.The movie is filled with twisted twists (the kind that Letts is best known for) and this is the second major awards contender to come out on the same day (Christmas!) involving romantically involved first cousins (what's up with that?!). The acting is of course phenomenal and every actor delivers an impressive performance. Especially Streep and Roberts but it's also great to see Cumberbatch continue to diversify (and make a huge name for himself in the process) by playing wildly different roles. Here he plays the shy and awkward outcast of the family, that's always being picked on by his mother. I found him to be by far the most relatable but all of the characters seemed believable and real. It's darkly comedic and full of laughs but it also has a lot of hard hitting drama. It's twisted but genuine and it reminds us all that 'everyone's a freak' (and we all have embarrassing secrets). It's everything you've come to expect from Letts and Wells does a good enough job bringing his material to life. He's no Friedkin (of course) but he does just fine.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VljRGPnGo0s",August - Osage County
37,thesar-2,Family Dearest,9,18 January 2014,"""Thank God, we can't tell the future. We'd never get out of bed."" – Barbara (Julia Roberts.)Um, I guess that is true. Pessimistic, but accurate. Much like the rest of the incredibly true-to-life – to my experience, that is – movie, August: Osage County.Okay, yeah, this is fiction, but from what I observed, I saw truth here. Each character here in this wildly dysfunctional family, reminded me – some more than others – of people of my own life. Some people, in my mind, were exaggerations, some were dead-on and some were just around the corner. But, all existed in one form or another.As a ton of standup comedians and a lot of screenplay writers point out, we all have crazy families. I'm no exception to that rule. Maybe that's why I could relate and celebrate August: Osage County – because I was on the outside looking in this time.Daddy's gone missing, again, and this brings the family, and extended family and friends together. When things get worse, so does the family on screen and the secrets burn up the dialogue and actions.While not groundbreaking, the uniqueness and depth of the characters, the profound dialogue, wonderful music and the connection I had with the characters from my own life (of which, I choose not to name names, since they might read this – ha) kept me going until the very satisfying ending. It was so because it was so real.Highly recommended and definitely for fans of the cast and have their own nutso family.* * * Final thoughts: While I did like the majority of performances here, the one I centered in on the most was Julia Roberts. Yes, over the great Meryl Streep. If Streep does win the 2013 best Actress Oscar, more power to her. But, to me, the number one here was Roberts. By far, her best performance since 2000's Erin Brockovich.",August - Osage County
38,Robert_duder,A tragic and fascinating look at a very dysfunctional family,8,30 January 2014,"I wasn't sure what to expect from August: Osage County. I had seen the trailers, heard the buzz and of course had expectations from Meryl Streep and her latest Oscar nominated performance. I can assure you I was not disappointed. This is a dark, sad, depressing film about a group of people that to me felt almost too real for comfort. Some of the audience members in the theatre were howling in laughter at certain scenes (the incredibly dark dinner scene for instance) and I don' feel that any part of this required laughing out loud. Perhaps they grew up in a more stable environment than I did (not that I my upbringing was so bad.) The entire film was just plain sad. It was gut wrenching to watch these people, some of them downright horrible human beings but conditional to their own life and upbringing. It would be an absolutely riveting and fascinating movie to watch from a psychological point of view. I don't think there was a single character unnecessary or left untapped. In such an enormous ensemble cast you would think someone would come out underdeveloped and while some are focused on less than others, everyone is intriguing and worth mentioning. Did I think it was one of the best movies of the year? No. In fact I thought it was parallel to a very similar Julia Roberts film from a few years ago called ""Fireflies In The Garden"" which got ripped apart from critics and barely released. And yet I thought this was on the same level and very similar themes.I will start with the Grand Dame of film Meryl Streep. She is a brilliant actress, who could argue with that. I completely understand why she was nominated for this Oscar. She is disturbing, often brilliant in this role as the matriarch of this messed up family. I also thought she overplayed it at times and seemed almost too over the top and yet that was also the character who was over-dramatic and crying for attention so I'm torn on that front. Regardless she was terrific. I actually thought Julia Roberts did just a little bit better in her role. I thought her character was completely fascinating and perhaps I related to her just a little bit more than everyone else. I can't even begin to explain the multiple facets to her complicated character and everything going on in her life and the tumultuous and volatile relationship with her mother. She is the one person you beg to see get some sort of redemption. Ewan McGregor is good in a more understated way as Roberts' estranged husband. I wish I could spend time breaking down for you each and every character because they are each so fascinating in their own way. McGregor's chemistry and relationship with Roberts is particularly good. Margo Martindale was outstanding in her role as Streep's sister. She had such a great character and I think gave an Oscar worthy performance in her own right. She holds her own with Streep and everyone else easily. I also really enjoyed the performance by Chris Cooper (again understated and subtle) but had some key moments and really good performance. I have sort of pointed out my personal favourite performances but please make note that the rest of the cast were all excellent including Sam Shepard, Abigail Breslin, Dermot Mulroney, Julianne Nicholson, Misty Upham and even two performances by actors that I don't care for Benedict Cumberbatch (over-rated in my opinion) and Juliette Lewis (also over-rated) and yet they both served their purpose and did quite well though I still was slightly annoyed by Lewis but I think that was also sort of the point to her character. Everyone was so good and so good together and each character could be talked about for hours on end.As with many movies based on plays you can tell in certain scenes how it would have played out on stage and it is easy to see that this screenplay requires some truly talented actors to pull it off. To me John Wells is perhaps a slightly odd choice for director only because he doesn't have a lot of directorial credits outside of The Company Men (a film I also thoroughly enjoyed actually.) Wells certainly handles this incredibly large cast a very dark story extremely well. I did have an issue with the ending, its perhaps the one firm negative thing I can say about an otherwise very good movie. I understand the original playwright wanted the film to end on a far more ambiguous note but the film makers decided audiences would want more of a neat little bow ending. I admit I think I would enjoy more of a neat little bow to this story but if that's what they think they did...they're wrong. The ending is still very ambiguous and I suppose you're supposed to draw certain conclusions but its just not a great ending and feels very tacked on. This is still a fascinating drama and while I don't think its the best movie of the year by any means, it is a powerful cast in a very solidly made film. 8.5/10",August - Osage County
39,ElMaruecan82,"Come to Laugh, Come to Cry, Come to Care, but not necessarily to Terms ...",8,31 July 2014,"""August: Osage County"" centers on a dysfunctional family, rooted in the plains of Oklahoma, as dry and bare as the heart of its remaining matriarch who has nothing but 'belittling comments' to distribute as wry marks of affections, giving a disturbingly ironic significance to the oral cancer she suffers from pain-in-the-mouth, pain-in-the-ass. We understand that Violet, Meryl Streep in another (what-did-you-expect) virtuoso performance, let bitterness grow in the heart of her three daughters, each one proving that there can be more than one worst-case scenario.By the way, it's interesting that many dysfunctional families feature daughters. I remember Woody Allen's dramatic masterpiece ""Interiors"" was about three sisters struggling to give their life a meaning after the deterioration of their parents' marriage and their mother's descent into madness. Again, you had the practical and rational sister, the easy-going one, and the tormented middle-child. I think there is some Oedipal meaning to it, while brothers, protective toward their mother tend to stand together, sisters are closer to the father, and are more liable to be rivals either to their mother or for their father, which is conflict-wise, more promising.The oldest daughter is Julia Roberts as Barb, the one who inherited her mother's strong-willed genes, a strength that ultimately lead her husband to leave her for a younger woman, and naturally, her daughter Jean (Abigail Breslin) grew as a disturbed pseudo-rebellious teenager. There's no excuse for her husband's behavior, but Ewan McGregor strikes as the kind of decent guy who can only be 'accidentally' bad, and it's as if Barb made such situation inevitable, as if there was an innate incapability to express love in her heart.The other sisters are Karen (Juliette Lewis), the youngest and most deluded one, who embraced life with an ersatz of optimism to better cancel out her crappy past and came to the house with a sleazy Florida businessman (Dermot Mulroney) the last of a string of boyfriends, and I want to add : so far. And there is Ivy (Julianne Nicholson) who stayed close to home and as a reward, suffers from the old-maid syndrome where any attempt to express her personality is repressed by her mother. No rewards to her good intentions except low self-esteem and bad luck (for reasons I won't spoil) that lead her heart to her first cousin (Benedict Cumberbatch).And in this drama whose witty and punchy dialogs are fueled by alcohol and unhealthy rainbows of pills, pain-killers and anti-depressants, each scene manages to be both entertaining and true to life, painting the live portrait of a family collapse, whose warning signs were the slow disintegration of its founding marriage. Basically ""August Osage County"" is to Family what ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" is to couple, and the film is driven by fantastic performances, all carrying their level of pathos with talent and authenticity mostly from women, but men have their words to say.Chris Cooper is the husband of Violet's sister Mattie Fae (Margo Martindale), a lighter version of the infamous Hillary Swank's redneck mother in ""Million Dollar Baby"", lacking compassion and empathy toward her only son. Benedict Cumberbatch who'd make any heart melt as the ill-regarded ""Little Charles"". And if poor Charles couldn't stand up for his beliefs, at least, he'll inspire one of the most emotionally satisfying moments in the movie, and established men as the Yin to the film's dysfunctional Yang. Ironically, the only positive female figure is Johnna (Misty Upham), the Native maid hired by Violet's husband, Beverly (Sam Shepard) a once-renowned poet, a decent guy too.With these characters brought all together after Beverly's disappearance, you have all the ingredients assembled for these great family brawls, with their share of secrets, revelations and twisted plot twists, and you have the local Oklahoman touch, making the film a mix between ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" (it was adapted from a play by Tracy Letts) and ""About Schmidt"". It's greatly written, full of authentic moments such as the dinner scene, Cooper's graces and many mother-and-daughters truth-telling moments  it's an ensemble movie and I guess this is the role Julia Roberts should have won an Oscar for, not Erin 'gimme-a-break' Brockovich.And while I saw the film, I thought I already had the title of my review in mind, something like ""one's end inspiring many new beginnings"", something about the necessity of reuniting to finally come to terms with the past and take a new start. Yet, the film ends quite abruptly, leaving too many interrogation marks. I don't expect a happy ending again, but all the movies I mentioned had somewhat of a resolution, a way for us to catch our breath and fill our hearts with hope. I know ""hope"" is a big word but it's precisely because the movie didn't leave much for optimism in the beginning than I kept having in mind this ""it can't be worse"" feeling.I understand it was meant to be a realistic drama and in reality, many problems are left unresolved, if only because most people chose to escape or hide instead of facing their responsibilities, but maybe the reunion was a way to put an end to it, maybe there had been enough secrets in this family and it was time not just to let them out, but to make it worth it. I will never see these characters again, so I wish we had a few glimpses of what would happen to them after.Besides, Tracy Letts meant the film as a tribute to his background, to show that Midwest isn't just populated by Rubes or Rednecks, like in the movies, I'm not sure the ending would reconcile a perplexed audience with the Midwest. I know it's not a requirement for a great film, but after all the pain, and noises and stress, we went through, even a temporary resolution would've been enough. Some characters' arcs were meant to be closed  even temporarily",August - Osage County
40,paul2001sw-1,American gothic,5,24 August 2019,"A distinguished cast overacts wildly but unconvingly in John Wells' 'August: Osage County', none more so than Meryl Streep in the leading role. She plays the matriach of an Oklahoman family with serious problems: they gather for a funeral and proceed to expose themselves as close to a parody of contemporaray American Southern gothic. Maybe there really are people like this, but there's little subtlety in any of the characters, and far more to pity than to like. And while I've no problem with films based on stageplays, some modulation of thespian technique would have been appreciated.",August - Osage County
41,dromasca,huge acting by Meryl Streep,8,8 February 2014,"I had seen the play that inspired August: Osage County a few years back on stage at the HaBima theater in Tel Aviv and I confess that I did not remember much of the story. It took me this second viewing with its fine acting to appreciate the text written by Tracy Letts, which smartly puts each one of its characters at its place and gives it a good reason of being what it is. It is hard to believe that John Wells is only at his second long feature film, but then he has a long career as a producer and his tentative of switching to the shouted rather than the shouting side of the industry provides many good reasons for seeing this work.Set in the flat landscape of Oklahoma during the hottest possible season August: Osage County starts as a thriller although we never know what really happened to the patriarch of the family who disappears two minutes in the film to become soon dead. The reason oh his death does not matter too much, as we understand quickly that the life of a poet and professor of poetry could not be too happy in this environment and it's not only weather but a totally dis-functional family that carries in the 21st century the scars of the economic disasters and crisis that marked America in its first half, and of the incapability of its members to deal with the psychological traumas and avoid making the lives miserable one to each other. It's a big and unhappy family in the tradition of Leon Tolstoy, and we watch how the masks fall from the faces of the characters one after the others, how the reasons of their behaviors, their fears and personal hells are brought to surface exactly at the moment when the families we know are expected to get together at the loss of a dear one. The families we know are never on screen however, but can we really say that we did not know some of the situations or of the characters in this movie? I suggest to the Academy to create a new category besides the Best Actress and this would be 'Best Actress Who Is Not Meryl Streep'. Her performance here is so huge, her immersion in the character is so total that I am afraid that she is even better than Cate Blanchett, my supreme love (as actress) in 'Blue Jasmine' which I did not see yet. She is so good that we hardly pay attention to the great acting of Julia Roberts in one of her best roles ever, and of all the other members of the cast. Even if complicated family dramas are not your cup of tea (they are not mine), even if the film making has a dose of theatricality (it is based upon a theater play) this film is worth seeing and may offer the best acting in this film season.",August - Osage County
42,ThomasDrufke,"Dark, Depressing, Personal Drama",8,26 April 2014,"There may not be a better acted film all around this year than this film is. From Streep to Cooper to Roberts to Cumberbatch its perfectly acted. Im actually surprised more nominations weren't handed out other than Roberts and Streep. But I have to say this film surprised me with the amount of darkness it actually has. I expected it to be dramatic but didn't think there would be as little of humor as it ended up with. The trailers seem to promise something other than what the film showcased. While most of the time I would hate that, I enjoyed the amount of darkness.The dinner scene was quite memorable as it involves almost all the characters bantering at each other in what is seemingly one take. I'm sure it wasn't but it was directed in a way that made it feel flawless. Streep and Roberts have some really great emotional moments that can hit home for anyone who has hit significant family issues in their life. Roberts character, Barbara, has basically everyone closest to her ripped away one way or another and its devastating to watch. It' s a movie that can really make you think about not only whats most important in your life but really how family can be split by not staying in touch with each other over the years. A perfect first 2 acts finished with a pretty weak 3rd act. With less Streep it doesn't have the same emotional impact that the first part of the movie does, and particularly the dinner scene. Thus the movie still resonates with you, as does the bigger conflict that emerges in the ladder half of the movie.8.9/10",August - Osage County
43,g-bodyl,Watch Out for the Dinner Scene!,9,29 January 2015,"August: Osage County is a movie exploring dysfunction in a family, a topic which was explored so many times before. But this movie seemingly takes a fresher approach to it. The cast is huge and each one have their moments to shine. There are several powerful scenes, but one scene to watch out for is that famous dinner scene, which is the highlight of the movie. It is also a testament to the skills of everyone involved. This is a powerful, emotional film about people who cannot stand to be around each other, but individually you can connect with each of them. John Well's film is a tale about the Weston family. Violet Weston is a lady who has cancer and is a drug addict, which makes her hard to be around with. After her husband had enough of her and commits suicide, the entire family comes up for the funeral. Being together may be the last thing anyone in the Weston family could ask for. One praise of the film is the in-depth acting, particularly by Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts. Streep is a goddess at acting and she shows a darker side to herself in this role. Roberts matches her head-on as the eldest daughter who shown to be herself of strong will. The rest of the cast has their moments to shine especially Chris Cooper and Benedict Cumberbatch. Overall, August: Osage County is an excellent drama although it may lack in humor and the screenplay itself is quite dark, which is fine by me. Not all family reunions are displays of pure happiness. The ending could use some tweaking as I'm not sure if it's fitting. But this film is all about the acting and the dinner scene with Meryl Streep gleefully giving everyone an earful. I must say I rather liked this film. I rate this film 9/10.",August - Osage County
44,lesleyharris30,"Stunning Performances Showcase a Harsh Reality,",9,24 July 2016,"August Osage County is a terrific film with a very well developed plot and a spectacular cast. It is a rare movie that is not afraid to tell it like it is, showing the complications of family and how tough it can be to keep it together. There really is no feel good factor to it, there are serious themes involved, from the likes of dementia, suicide, divorce, adultery and incest. It manages to tackle them all effectively, showcasing the seriousness of them. I did feel like the film was lacking optimism, there is no light at the end of the tunnel, a few light hearted moments would have been refreshing, showing the closely knitted family without any negativity surrounding them. It also would have given us a more personal insight on their relationship outside of the drama they are facing. The cast is really what brings it all together, there is not a poor performance in the bunch, the likes of Julia Roberts, Meryl Streep, Chris Cooper, Ewan McGregor and Margo Martindale are all very believable as a close, dysfunctional family. The dinner scene is groundbreaking film work, an entire sequence, roughly twenty five minutes long, of the family having food together, in which they let out a lot of their inner emotions, it was a risky move by the director but it succeeded. Albeit bleak, August Osage County is an extremely compelling film with spellbinding performances, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama.

47,Reno-Rangan,A better serious family drama than a comedy,9,18 March 2014,"Well, what made this movie a very special? Of course the stars. Yeah, this movie was overwhelmed with a pack great actors and actresses. It was based on a play and very beautifully cinematised. Usually scripts for plays are designed to take place in a limited location so that is why it was not stretched by map. The movie was shot at a couple of locations and the majority of them are in a country house, in that most part comes while dining. So that is where it kinda reminded me 'When do we eat?'.I love dramas specially which deals about a family issues like honest father, jobless son, lonely daughter, ill mother, drug addict grands children, rich laws, faithful maid et cetera. In some scenarios, it will reverse and becomes a great comedy like the one we had seen in Ben Stiller or Adam Sandler movies. Stories like this are very near to our lives, well, at least for somebody in some way. The much reality it goes, much impresses me. This is the one of a beautiful family drama of the year.The movie characters were portrayed in an elegant manner. The connections between each others and problems to be solved were placed in the perfect positions. In many parts you can see the extended scenes, it is because to give a feel of a cinema. Some of the quotes relating life and relationship were inspiring.In this movie, the three time Oscar winner Meryl Streep got an another nominee tag for her beautiful performance.

Director John Wells starry and talk fueled adaptation of Tracy Letts play is a movie filled with far too much acting and in many cases over-acting and not enough inhabiting of characters, it seems that all concerned were counting down the days until the Oscar arrived on their front doorstep.Leading the way with an at times downright maniacal display of over the top hysterics is Meryl Streep who somehow once more was nominated for her insane, frustrating and frankly unbelievable turn as cancer ridden family head Violet Weston. Streep is ably supported in the going all out stakes by the profanity spitting Julia Roberts and the annoying and annoyingly short shifted Juliette Lewis as daughters Barbara and Karen respectively, even normally ace British star Benedict Cumberbatch inhabits a strange turn as family cousin Little Charles. It's a worrying thing that the film goes from the extremes of these actors to the barely rising beyond a pulse turns from Ewan McGregor (who it must be said is horribly miscast), the frequently annoying Abigal Breslin and the usually reliable Chris Cooper. Only bit part players Margo Martindale and Dermot Mulroney come out on top in their respective roles but even if all actors were on top of their games it's highly unlikely the films story would of struck cinematic gold.No doubt striking a chord on stage, the material in August just isn't enough to warrant a 2 hour cinema venture with many scenarios and situations just not working on the screen. A key sequence in the film centered around the family dinner table is supposed to create all types of emotions within the audience but is instead derailed by an overarching sense of unbelieve-ability and again a reliance on the actors trying to out yell each OTHER! Other key revelations in the film feel horribly sign posted and at times wholly unnecessary.With stale direction, an abundance of miscalculated performances, a bunch of characters that aren't really worth caring about and with a story that never really goes to any places we haven't been to before and in many cases been to more convincingly, August: Osage County is saved from complete mediocrity by a couple of nice supporting acting turns and a strange sensation that you must keep watching to see just HOW LOUD THINGS CAN GET in the Weston household! 2 dropped casseroles out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",August - Osage County
49,Red-125,"The term ""dysfunctional family"" doesn't really do justice to the Westons",9,4 February 2014,"August: Osage County (2013) was directed by John Wells.The film takes place during a hot Oklahoma summer in the home of the Westons. Meryl Streep plays the matriarch, Violet Weston, whose family returns home because of a crisis. Streep is crafty and mean, especially when she's not addled by the pills she pops as if they were M&M's. Streep is a great acting treasure, and, as we expect, she plays her part superbly. Wells has brought together an all-star cast of great actors. They are all excellent. However, Julia Roberts, who stars as Barbara Weston, the oldest daughter, is incredibly good. I've kept an open mind about whether Roberts could act, or whether she was just coasting along on her beauty. Now I'm convinced--she really can act. She holds her own--in the movie, and in the acting honors--with Meryl Streep, and that calls for real talent. Misty Upham, as the Native American woman who works for the Westons, deserves special mention. She's a fine actor, and she portrays the only person in the movie who isn't broken in some way.This is definitely not a feel-good movie. It begins with sadness and anger, and the sadness and anger never leave it. It's worth seeing because the plot is fascinating. (Grim, but fascinating.) And, even more important, the acting is truly outstanding.We saw this film at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester. If it's still playing on the large screen when you read this review, I think that would be the best way to see it. If it's not available in a theater, see it on DVD. Don't miss it.

50,leonblackwood,Great Emotional Drama! 7/10,7,24 May 2014,"Review: I really enjoyed this heart warming tale about a family who really has some in depth issues. Each individual character has there own problems which all comes out when they get brought together at the family home. The acting from the whole cast is brilliant, along with the storyline which is emotional and full of drama. The chemistry between Juliet Roberts and her mum, Meryl Streep, was great but the ending could have done with a bit of work. The director done a great job by getting such a great cast who make the movie believable and a great watch. Enjoyable!Round-Up: It really does seem like Meryl Streep cannot do anything wrong. Her performance in this film is excellent, along with Juliet Roberts who must have been out of her comfort zone with this character. The scenes around the table were very well written, with a mix of emotions that will make you cry and laugh at the same time. Personally I think that Streep should have been given an academy award for her role because she is the core of the whole movie that holds the whole thing together. I just hope that people don't mistake it for a chick flick because there are many issues that every family can relate to.Budget: $25million Worldwide Gross: $74millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there emotional dramas about a dysfunctional family who are brought together after a death in the family. 7/10",August - Osage County
51,TheMovieDiorama,August: Osage County packs plenty of powerhouse performances that overwhelm its dysfunctional narrative.,6,27 January 2019,"Written by Letts and adapted from his own play, this prestigious drama contains the same issues that I outlined in my review for 'Fences'. Some plays just do not translate well onto the big screen. August is no different. Scene after scene filled with dramatic dialogue, mostly sat around a dinner table, that feels more involving on a stage. Still, the drama that is presented often captivates through its powerful performances. A dysfunctional family come together for a funeral service celebrating the life of the patriarch who recently drowned himself. When I say dysfunctional, I mean that and then some because damn the shouting is excessive and intense! Streep, the matriarchal figure, owns the family by attacking everyone. Roberts comes along and shouts over her to insert her authority. But then McGregor pipes up whilst carrying some chairs. Oh, there goes Streep again. Cumberbatch is up because his got a ""troof"" to shout. And now everyone is shouting on the floor! This ensemble cast of star-studded talent is well comprised and each give excellent performances, but they all fight to be the most notable actor and the whole ordeal becomes exhausting. Watching Streep and Roberts chew each scene and making nearly every single scene overly dramatic somewhat diminishes the drama that is taking place. The several dramatic plots, ranging from prescription drug addiction to an incestuous relationship, do hold substance. However the overacting and lack of conclusion for these plots unfortunately make for an underwhelming experience. I appreciated each performance, but Wells does nothing with his direction that substantiates the leap to the big screen. The closed environment and ""talkey"" dialogue better suits the stage. The only thing I took away from this, is that heated parakeet story...",August - Osage County
52,l_rawjalaurence,Bleak View of Rural Family Life,7,7 February 2014,"Set in the wilds of Oklahoma and based on a Broadway success, AUGUST: OSAGE COUNTY looks at the lives of two generations of strong-willed women, whose paths have diverged until a family tragedy brings them together one more. Over the course of a few days, several essential truths about their lives are brought to the surface after years of denial with destructive consequences. In terms of plot, John Wells' film has strong melodramatic echoes, most notably in the way familial skeletons in the cupboard are revealed so as to prevent any relationship between Little Charles Aiken (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Ivy Weston (Julianne Nicholson's). What makes it compelling is the quality of the performances: as the vengeful matriarch Violet Weston, Meryl Streep spits vitriol in almost every speech - years of living an isolated existence with an uncommunicative spouse (Sam Shepard) have warped her nature. Although racked with cancer, she demands no sympathy from her daughters; on the contrary, her belief in her impending death gives her license to tell the truth about their existences. As her daughter Barbara, Julia Roberts begins by trying to match her mother for emotional strength, but discovers to her cost that this is a sure-fire way towards isolation. Ewan McGregor, as her long-suffering spouse, eventually walks out on her, The third daughter Karen (Juliette Lewis) appears to have been emotionally scarred at a young age; unable to cope with the demands of returning to her family, she departs permanently for Florida. Adriano Goldman's cinematography appears to contrast the rolling Oklahoma landscape with the prison-like atmosphere of the family homestead, but as the film unfolds, we understand that the landscape itself is as much of a prison as the house. With no other properties - or anything in terms of civilization - in sight of the house, there is not much hope of anyone escaping their miseries of existence.",August - Osage County

Particularly Meryl Streep as Violet Weston and Julia Roberts as Barbara Weston-Fordham - both Academy Award nominees for this movie; they spend also most time on screen. All others are very good as well, it's a bit shame that the characters played by Chris Cooper, Benedict Cumberbatch, Juliette Lewis and Ewan McGregor were not so elaborated and they were not visible so much.Anyway, a strong drama, where family ties and values are often seen in a different light.

It's about a dysfunctional family that comes together after a member of the family dies, and realizes how dysfunctional they really are. Meryl plays the mother of the family, with Margo as her sister. Chris plays Margo's husband, Julia is one of Meryl's daughters and Ewan is Julia's husband. Meryl is a pill popper, Julia is separated from Ewan but trying to work things out, Margo drinks heavily....Well, like I said, dysfunctional. There is a lot of language used, if you are easily offended. There is also some good laughs, mixed in with the incest and pot smoking that goes on. I can just hear the critics saying that Meryl gives an Oscar worthy performance here, and it is pretty good.

55,meeza,In the County of Great Acting!,8,16 February 2014,"""August: Osage County"" is a dysfunctional family explosion that might go over the county-line on occasion with ""over the top"" family frenzy, but it's otherwise a worthy flick. The film stars Meryl Streep as Violet Weston, an outspoken Oklahoma mother of three adult females. She is a pill-popping drug addict who has succumbed to mouth cancer and is going through her last round of chemotherapy. She is an angry woman who tends to criticize all of her daughters and their significant others. When Violet's husband Beverly runs off unannounced, Violet's three daughters and company go to her home to support her and help her find Beverly, who might have just ran off to Beverly Hills. However, what turns out is a dysfunctional family verbal and even physical showdown; especially in the film's eventful dinner scene. So yea, here there are plenty of feisty dog days in August in Osage County. The movie is actually based on the award-winning play by Tracy Letts. And the film's director John Wells even Letts let in the fun by having him write the film's screenplay adapted from his critically-acclaimed play. Letts did not let us down with his gripping screenplay, and Wells did pretty well himself in the movie's osagestration, I mean orchestration. However, it was the ensemble acting of ""August: Osage County"" that was its strongest point. Streep was being her streepish self with her thundering starring performance as Violet Weston. And the rest of the Weston Girls were pretty darn good themselves; especially Julia Roberts as Violet's eldest daughter Barbara, and Julianne Nicholson as Violet's cousin-kissing daughter Ivy. Roberts though has not been this good in a while; it was satisfying to see the pretty woman revitalize her pretty thespian chops again. Other notable standout supporting performances derived from Margo Martindale as Violet's sister Mattie Fae, and Chris Cooper as Mattie Fae's husband Charlie; who presents the most comical dinner table prayer in the history of motion pictures. So even though it's not flawless, I still recommend a viewing trip to ""August: Osage County"". **** Good",August - Osage County

57,estebangonzalez10,"Powerful performances, witty dialogues, but just too depressing",5,24 January 2014,"""I thought we were having a funeral dinner not a cockfight.""Based on Tracy Letts' Pulitzer winning play of the same name, August: Osage County is a dark comedy about a dysfunctional family that are reunited for their father's funeral and several secrets are revealed along the way. This is director John Wells' follow up to his 2010 film The Company Men, with Letts adapting the screenplay of his own play. Add a very talented cast to the mix and you have all the right elements for a successful film, but somehow it failed to engage me. The characters in this film are so unlikable and they treat each other so terribly that I just found this film hard to enjoy. This is one family I would like to stay as far away as possible, and therefor I never felt comfortable watching this. This is an extremely verbally violent film which proves the point that words can hit harder than stones. August Osage County does have several positive things going for it beginning with some terrific performances from Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts. It also has a very witty and sharp screenplay as several secrets revealed along the way come as a surprise. It is a powerful film, but one that I never felt comfortable watching due to the fact I despised the way these characters treated each other. It was a depressing film, much like Lett's previous adapted play, Killer Joe. Despite having some fun moments I still felt like I'd be better off keeping away from this depressing story.The film opens with Beverly (Sam Shepard) interviewing a young Native American woman named Johnna (Misty Upham) for a position as a live-in maid. He tells her about his wife Violet (Meryl Streep) who has been diagnosed with cancer and her addiction to pills. He and his wife have made an agreement, he doesn't say anything to him about her addiction and she doesn't bother him for being an alcoholic. It's just the way they deal with each other and their problems. Violet interrupts the interview and seems disturbed because she doesn't think she needs anyone taking care after her. Several days later it appears that Beverly has gone missing. The first to arrive at Violet's home providing support are her daughter Ivy (Julianne Nicholson), her sister Mattie Fae (Margo Martindale) and Fae's husband Charlie (Chris Cooper). Violet spends most of her time drinking pills and criticizing her family, especially Ivy for still being single. Violet's oldest daughter, Barbara (Julia Roberts) arrives with her husband Bill (Ewan McGregor) and their fourteen year old daughter Jean (Abigail Breslin) just around the moment that they discover Beverly's boat is missing. Later that afternoon, the local sheriff arrives and announces they have found Beverly's body, saying that he committed suicide and drowned himself. Several days later the funeral is held and the rest of Violet's family arrives, including her other daughter, Karen (Juliette Lewis) with her fiancé Steve (Dermot Mulroney) . The stage is set as they gather together for diner after the service and chaos ensues as secrets are revealed and horrible things are said to each other.Meryl Streep may have just played her meanest role to date. She is a paranoid and dysfunctional woman who clearly has affected her children in the way she raised them. Julia Roberts also holds her own against Streep as they share some very powerful scenes together. The dialogue is witty and funny at times, while revealing some surprises along the way, but it's just the way these people treat each other that makes you want to stay away from them. The performance from the entire cast was above par, and the film succeeds in portraying them as these despicable and hateful people. Benedict Cumberbatch and Chris Cooper being both perhaps the most sympathetic characters in the film, although they do have their flaws as well. Despite all the strong performances I do believe Roberts and Streep steal each scene they are in. They deserve all the recognition they've been receiving, but I just had a hard time watching this movie and getting through the entire thing. This is one of those stories that seem to have worked better as a play than in the big screen.",August - Osage County

This overdone flick is a laff-riot! Everyone plays to the camera, as if it is a captive audience, and no one more than Streep herself! That's why this entire movie is more comedy than drama or even just a serious story.It appears to me that every scene was planned out to start soft, expand in anger (or whatever) then like a balloon - burst! The only actress who actually acts her part is Margo Martindale who plays her role to perfection! At no time is she playing to the camera!What a silly movie this is and just 'sssooo much drama' it becomes a goof ball comedy.

61,3xHCCH,Excellent Ensemble Acting Showcase,7,10 January 2014,"""August: Osage County"" was adapted by its own playwright Terry Letts into a screenplay. I have not seen the play yet, but am looking forward to seeing one in a few months from now. The standard set by the ensemble of actors in this film will be so hard to top.This play is set in an Oklahoma town on one warm summer. Violet Wetson (Meryl Streep) reunites with her three willful daughters, Barbara (Julia Roberts), Ivy (Julianne Nicholson) and Karen (Juliette Lewis) when there was a death in the family. Fireworks fly when family secrets are revealed as mother and daughters clash.Meryl Streep is again in top form here as a dysfunctional wife and mother made worse by her dependency on drugs given for her cancer. This role has Oscar written all over it, and Ms. Streep again grabs this bull by the horns. She is one scary virago here, one you would not want to meet in real life. To even imagine someone like her to be your mother is unthinkable.Julia Roberts plays the eldest daughter Barbara with restraint until that post-funeral lunch when her top blows up and all hell breaks loose. We see a mature and gritty Julia here, going full circle from her first Oscar nomination with another family-oriented play turned film ""Steel Magnolias."" Ewan McGregor plays her husband Bill who loves her but can't stand her. Abigail Breslin plays her 14-year old daughter Jean, who is trying to grow up faster than she should.Juliette Lewis plays another quirky and flighty character here. It seems only these types of roles fit her unusually unique face. Her Karen brings home a much-older fiancé Steve (Dermot Mulroney) with fast sports car and stash of pot.Julianne Nicholson plays the daughter who stayed home to take care of her parents, Ivy. It seems she has been around for a long time, but this is the first film that I have taken notice of her. Her character has secret dreams and desires that could not take off because she is trapped in her situation in life, and Nicholson portrays that pain and frustration very well.We will also meet Violet's fussy and nosy sister Mattie Fay, played by Margo Martindale. Her husband Charles is played by Chris Cooper, who is quietly dignified through most the film, until he had his own confrontation scene with his wife. Their son shy and insecure ""Little"" Charles is sensitively played by Benjamin Cumberbatch. This 2013 has really been a big debut year for Cumberbatch with diverse roles in big films like ""Star Trek In Darkness"", ""12 Years a Slave"", now this one.This may not be for all because of the depressing family squabbling going on for two hours. However, I thought the dialogues were really darkly witty in their bitterness and spite. The main reason to watch this film though would be the masterclass in ensemble acting. Seeing all these actors interact together enhancing each other's performances is the big positive in watching a film like this.",August - Osage County
62,dierregi,Bad things happening to bad people,5,28 September 2017,"Violet is a bitter woman, unhappily married with Beverly and mother of three daughters: Barbara, Ivy and Karen. Barbara's marriage with Bill is on the rocks, Ivy is a spinster and Karen changes frequently boyfriend. The daughters and Violet's deceitful sister Mattie Fae, congregate for Beverly's funeral and a final family showdown.Streep and Roberts, as mother Violet and daughter Barbara, give vanity-free performances in this disturbing tale of a dysfunctional family. However, that is not quite enough to make watching this movie a pleasant experience.Streep is great, but some of her speeches are too staged. For instance, the story about her boots is moving, but it is delivered like an actress would, with a lot of flourishing and pauses for maximum effect, which spoils the harshness of the events narrated.Jean, Barbara's teenage daughter is the stereotypical American young woman: an obnoxious, self-centered bitch, who hates her mother for unidentified reasons. Her scene with randy Steve is both puzzling and annoying: the much older fiancé of aunt Karen gives Jean some grass to smoke, about which she has no problem, then asks her to show him her tits - also no problem for Jean.But when their sleazy flirtation is interrupted, Jean blames her mother and so does dad Bill. I wonder why was Barbara to be blamed: for Jean's slutty behavior or for Steve's lecherous one? The events narrated take place during the hot month of August, but all characters wear too many clothes. In a hot summer morning nobody could (and would) wear a robe over a long-sleeved shirt  and without the slight perspiration, like Barbara.The incestuous angle was maybe a little too much, considering the conflicted and fractured relationships in the family.Finally, it was sad to see Shepard looking already so frail. Not a pleasant experience and I would not watch this again.",August - Osage County
63,Amari-Sali,"If a soap opera was given a movie after being canceled, it would be something like August: Osage County.",8,26 January 2014,"Just the name of the cast is what should easily draw you to the film. You have Meryl Streep, who even in that movie with Roseanne was good; Ewan McGregor, who is pretty consistent; and alongside them you have Julia Roberts; Chris Cooper; little Abigail Breslin, who ain't so little no more; and then you have Juliette Lewis; Benedict Cumberbatch; and Julianne Nicholson, who plays Dr. DePaul on Masters of Sex.Characters & StoryFor those unfamiliar with the play, the basis of the movie is that this Oklahoma family comes together after the patriarch of the family, Beverly (played by Sam Shepard), dies. With his death, the family is brought together and this leads to a lot of arguments and secrets coming out. Most of the film focuses on the issues of, and between, the matriarch Violet (played by Meryl Streep) and her daughter Barbara (played by Julia Roberts). The others in the film get to occasionally jump in and go at it with these two, while sometimes getting some dialog in about what is happening in their own lives.The main issues include Barbara and Bill's (played by Ewan McGregor) marital issues; Karen's (played by Juliette Lewis) relationship issues, of which currently Steve (played by Dermot Mulroney) is the next one likely to be a screw-up; Mattie Fae's (played by Margo Matindale) issues when it comes to her son Little Charles (played by Benedict Cumberbatch), her marriage to Charles Sr. (played by Chris Cooper), as well her upbringing with sister Violet; and lastly there is Ivy's (played by Julianne Nicholson) issues, of which a man is involved.PraiseAs you can expect, the praise for the film definitely goes to Meryl Streep, though admittedly I feel the main reason she is deserving of praise is because when you compare Violet to Streep's other roles, Violet stands out due to her not being the type of character which calls for tight control of your emotions and actions. Violet is loose and vulgar, and Streep being in a character which cares nothing about poise is refreshing. Same goes for Julia Roberts who curses, and can be as nasty, if not nastier, than Streep sometimes is with her character.And really, though the overall story seemed a bit condensed, rushed, and so much like a soap opera summed up into 2 hours, it really does keep you attentive. Between the arguments between Barbara and everyone; mixed in with a decent amount of family drama, including a family secret, you won't end up bored.CriticismBut, at the same time I think I should note that both Streep and Robert's performances are a double-edged sword. For while it is interesting to watch both of these actresses, who usually don't pick these type of women to portray, their performances feel more like cathartic releases more than the type of performances meant to make you get lost in their characters or even make you feel something. And the reason I say this is because it seems both Barbara and Violet pretty much argue with each other, or the cast, until exhaustion, and then someone gets to interject and talk about their character's life, and then it is back to being about Barbara or Violet. Which, you can understand to a point since Roberts and Streep are the two money making names of the film, but after a certain point I felt like they are being focused on too much and that no one else is being allowed to try to connect to the audience at all. In fact, I'd say the film stripped the emotional complexities of these characters, who have gone through abuse, being cheated on and etc., and all that is left to see is 2 hours of the type of mindless drama which seems written no better than your general daytime soap opera, but it benefits from having a more seasoned cast.Overall: TV ViewingStreep remains good but, despite this character change, it doesn't shake you up and make you think she is topping herself at all. She is simply working, and due to her work being better than most, what is average for her seems superb in comparison to her fellow actresses. As for the rest of the cast, while it is nice to see Roberts play a more vulgar character, she is forgetful in the long run and everyone else pretty much plays second fiddle to the lives of these two actresses' characters. Thus making the film only worth TV viewing. For while the drama is interesting, it doesn't create any emotional connection and really is just soap opera drama put into a 2 hour movie of which sometimes it feels like the attempt to give everyone a back-story leads to no one being particularly interesting or well done.",August - Osage County

65,jadepietro,Family Feud,8,22 January 2014,"This film is recommended.Long ago, when my age was still in the single digits, my mother turned to me after leaving a family gathering and said, ""You can pick your friends, but not your relatives. Choose wisely. You've got them for the rest of your life!"" I didn't quite understand this sage advice back then, but after seeing August: Osage County, no truer words could have been spoken. The film, based on Tracey Letts' Tony and Pulitzer Prize winning play, tells the story of the Weston family, a picture perfect assemblage of dysfunction if there ever was one. The film packs a powerful punch as each family member is hell bent on destroying the next whenever the chance arises, which is every five minutes with no downtime. No one is more content to begin the verbal warfare than its head matriarch, a pill-popping, alcoholic gorgon named Violet, superbly played by Meryl Streep. The family has come together for the funeral of Beverly, the father of this brood (Sam Shepard). He has conveniently walked away from this clan and disappeared from life, committing suicide. Coming home to the festivities are daughters Barbara (Julia Roberts), Karen (Juliette Lewis), and Ivy (Julianne Nicholson), all bringing their emotional baggage with them. Barbara is in the midst of a divorce from her husband, Bill (Ewan McGregor) with her precocious kid in tow, Jean (Abigail Breslin). Karen is in a relationship with a sleazy boyfriend, Steve (Dermot Mulroney). Lonely Ivy pines for her cousin Little Charlie (Benedict Cumberbatch). Rounding out the party are Violet's sister Mattie Mae (Margo Martindale and her hen-pecked hubby, Charles Aiken (Chris Cooper), with Misty Upham as Johnna, the family's Native American maid who literally cleans up after their messes. The centerpiece of the film, as in the Broadway play, is an explosive dinner where tensions are as high as Violet herself. All air their dirty little secrets throughout this weekend in the country. ￼Solidly directed by John Wells, August: Osage County is a true ensemble piece that depends so much on the actors and their interplay. On stage, the action is more direct and intimate due to the nature of the media. On film, that same action takes on more distance and needs a company that can fade into these well-written roles. On stage, the actors for Steppenwolf Theatre Company brought Letts' words to life and melded into the Westons. On film, the actors are a similar if not altogether successful force, resulting in some superb acting choices and some uneven stunt casting too. At the top of the list is Ms. Streep once again. Her Violet is a vicious and pathetic woman who relishes more in the hurt she causes than the love she never had. It is a terrific performance. Holding her own opposite her is Ms. Roberts who literally comes to the table with a powerful portrayal of a daughter who has been wronged for all those years. Her frustration and anger is released in a fury of emotions and the actress is a revelation. Also bringing the right indignation and rage to their characters are Nicholson, Cooper, and particularly Martindale. However, some of the other actors fare less well but are still effective in their roles while a few are awkwardly miscasting such as McEregor and Cumberbatch. This lack of conciseness with the various casting never allows the film to reach the creative heights it did on the stage. (Those who have not experienced the fine stage production may have a more positive reaction to the movie.) ￼ Still, the film carries enough emotional clout to resonate with a movie-going audience, largely due to the strong acting of Ms. Streep and Ms. Roberts. August: Osage County is a compelling but ultimately artificial experience staged for your entertainment,. The film is more melodramatic than genuinely dramatic. Be that as it may, there is many fine moments in this film adaptation and much to savor. If dysfunction and pettiness is your cup of tea, drink it all in, especially if you are the type who like going to family reunions. I reluctantly do go to these familial affairs on occasion, always keeping my mother's wise comment in mind before closing the door behind me.

66,Seraphion,Strong drama that often lead into comedic situations,7,8 February 2015,"The movie presents a strong family drama inside a dysfunctional family. As the movie goes on it reveals more and more the disturbances in the procreated smaller families of the children. It also opens up about long past faults and the makeshift ways to amend them. The movie leaves those problems just as is, without giving an resolution to any of them. The drama builds up slow but at an accelerated pace. It then escalated very quickly as it nears the peak and explodes with a comedic situation. The comedic situation surely invites people to laugh, but when we think of it again, it feels strange to laugh at other people's serious family problems. The acting overall is nicely good. Julia Roberts and Meryl Streep acted out their parts very strongly, giving life to the emotions of their characters. Benedeict Cumberbatch adds very nicely through his rather smaller past.

67,burlesonjesse5,"The film will upset you, the acting will amaze you",7,9 May 2014,"August: Osage County is a film that teams up a host of fine actors/actresses who have worked with each other in the past and now meet again. It is based on a play (of the same name with the script being written by the actual playwright). The result is something that I expected. ""August"" is a completely dialogue driven vehicle that highlights a master class in performance compatibility (particularly by stars Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts). What's on screen is rooted in the extreme denouncement of dysfunctionality. The family featured and dissected, is so out of whack, they make the characters from say Mommie Dearest and Ordinary People to look like members of the Brady Bunch. A majority of these people are ones you dislike and they might force you to walk out of the theater while you try to put up with them. However, everyone is at the top of their game and needles to say, they all do superb work. ""August"" wants you to embrace its setting consisting of 100 degree plus heat, the underlying depression brought on by Eric Clapton's ditty, ""Lay Down Sally"" (I didn't think that was possible), and a sloppy narrative that still for some reason, keeps you tuned in to what exactly is going on. I'm recommending this film because of its ripe, teething script and the dialogue spoken with feverish glare by all the actors. Yeah, it's bleak stuff. But it's a showcase nonetheless.With Streep portraying a woman with mouth cancer (and who still likes to smoke about 2-3 packs a day) and Abigail Breslin taking in the scenery as a 14 year old who masquerades as a moderate pot smoker, August: Osage County brings together the Weston-Fordam-Aiken family for a sort of meeting to find Streep's missing husband (Beverly Weston played in a bit part by Sam Shepard). Once this alcoholic better half is found dead (by way of drowning), everyone gets together for the funeral all the while loading up on bickering and revealing of all flaws embedded in their immediate clan. Set in the Northern Oklahoma town of Pawhuska, this film escalates its scenes to the point where a ticking time bomb might go off.Meryl is intense and scary as Violet Weston. Although she seems to get award acclamation at the drop of a hat, this time her Academy Award nomination is well deserved. Julia Roberts as Barbara Weston-Fordam is equally intense as her resentful, Denver residing daughter who feigns at the notion that Violet is overdosing daily on all types of drug addicted medication. Then there's Robert's soft husband (Bill Fordam played by Ewan McGregor) who goes along for the ride but is separated from her. Her daughter is Jean Fordam (played by Abigail Breslin who is mentioned earlier) and her sisters are played by Juliette Lewis (Karen Weston) along with nearby resident Ivy Weston (Julianne Nicholson). Rounding out the cast are acting heavyweights in the form of Chris Cooper, Dermot Mulroney, and Benedict Cumberbatch (the villain from Star Trek: Into Darkness). All the players with their angst-ridden personas, come up aces. The casting director for ""August"" really deserves their own perceptive enshrinement.As I said earlier though, ""August"" doesn't possess a happy ending nor does it clear anything up in terms of scaring and fortitude. You as the audience member, are pulled through the mud because of the naked, tragically enhanced portrayals by everyone involved. They talk down to each other, yearn for an argument between them, and ultimately bare their soul. This ensemble acting slightly reminded me of 1998's Hurlyburly, where star Sean Penn seemed to have collapsed a lung trying to get his hard earned thoughts out.When this exhausting thing runs its course and you figure everyone involved (in the movie, not in real life) should avoid each other for many years to come, its conclusion reveals an icky secret amongst the family members ultimately brought upon by the brain damaged character portrayed by Streep. She's the ultimate instigator here and you love and hate her equally because well, this woman is one heck of an actress. Ultimately, this is the type of film that you see if your depressed because what this family goes through might make you feel better about your own kin. On the other hand, if you're having a lousy day and feel down trout, you might be more subjected to viewing a flick with a little more uppity vibe. For what it's worth, August: Osage County is a fireball of majestic performances. Despite its flaws, it's just as good as ""August"" and everything after (no pun intended on The Counting Crows 1993 album release).",August - Osage County
68,bob-rutzel-1,The Dialogues Make This Good,8,10 April 2014,"Beverly Weston (Sam Shepard) commits suicide and all the family gathers for the funeral. Beverly's wife Violet (Meryl Streep) has cancer of the mouth and is addicted to drugs to calm the pain. The daughters come home with bitterness in their hearts and anger toward the mother who they considered mean; and secrets spill out that end up changing everyone's lives. This is based upon a play by Tracy Lett (he also did the screenplay) so you know it's going to be talky, talky, talky. But, wait a minute: the dialogues are spot on, quick and there is no long catharsis by anyone. Catharsis yes, but not long ones. This helps. The pacing is very good and you become engaged (as do other Inquiring minds) and want to know what everyone is holding back until it cannot be held in no longer. The funeral dinner is the catalyst that brings almost everything out into the open. The daughters have issues with their mother and feel they had been wronged growing up. But, Violet has an ace up her sleeve and she lets loose with things her children do not know. But, now they do. There is big secret later on and this brings everyone to the moment of truth. And, also it is here that Violet gives up another ace. Nothing - you will learn- nothing gets by Violet. The movie made a big deal about the heat in this part of Oklahoma in August, but the heat is forgotten as soon as we get into the meat of the story. Well, I guess they had to talk about something as the family members gathered. The best line to come out of this is uttered by Julia Roberts as Barbara Weston and goes something like: ""Thank God we can't see the future. We'd never get out of bed."" I suppose there is some truth to that. This is a very good supporting cast with Violet's daughters: Julianne Nicholson as Ivy Weston, Juliette Lewis as Karen Weston and Julia Roberts as Barbara Weston. Chris Cooper, Ewan McGregor, Dermot Mulroney, Abigail Breslin, Margo Martindale and Benedict Cumberbatch round out the rest of the cast. No matter what cast member was on screen, you were attentive. Kudos to all. Meryl Streep received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress; and Julia Roberts received one for Actress in a Supporting Role. They didn't win, but both were deserving.The snippy/snappy, quick, and heartfelt dialogues make this very good. (8/10) Violence: Yes. Johnna (Misty Upham), the maid, whacks someone with a shovel. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes.",August - Osage County
69,bandw,A turgid melodrama,5,2 May 2014,"This movie presents the audience with a dysfunctional family that pushes the envelope for that genre. The story revolves around Violet (Meryl Streep) and her three daughters. Spouses and other relatives (and some non-relatives) are also sucked into the maelstrom. In response to a family crisis (Violet's husband walking out and not coming back) all the characters show up at Violet's big home in northeastern Oklahoma. The movie stages (and I do mean stages) most scenes so that every person can get in on lacerating whomever is nearby. Violet is the ringleader for this circus. I think all of the praise for Meryl Sreep is going to her head, since she overacts her part to the point of embarrassment. I would have appreciated this better if Streep could have dialed it back a notch (or maybe two). I think of Katharine Hepburn's nuanced performance in a similar role in ""Long Day's Journey Into Night."" Outside of Streep, the rest of the cast is top quality, but the one person who most captured my attention was Julianne Nicholson who played one of Violet's daughters. Nicholson was one of the few saving graces of this for me.There was an occasional scene inserted for comic relief (much needed), like the long rambling dinnertime grace said by Chris Cooper. But I found humor to be in short supply. Tracy Letts wrote the screenplay, based on his stage play. Just judging from this movie I would say that Letts is a Tennessee Williams manqué.Some things did not compute for me. Violet was supposedly suffering from mouth cancer (symbolic?), but she seemed to have enough energy to vigorously spew her venom whenever she desired. We see that she is addicted to about a dozen drugs. When one of the daughters empties all of her drugs down the toilet, Violet does not go into any withdrawal. Given the amount of drugs she was taking she should have been in the hospital or dead.I suppose the final scene was to show how vulnerable Violet was, leaving the impression that her verbal attacks were only the defense of a wounded soul. I didn't buy it; Violet remained an unsympathetic, unpleasant person for me. There is a ""making of"" extra on the DVD where all of the cast members sit in front of an audience complimenting each other.",August - Osage County
70,Sergeant_Tibbs,Open wounds on a tender spot.,6,27 December 2013,"Meryl Streep emerges from the darkness in her opening scene clutching a cigarette, having a near bald head and slurring her speech. Her interpretation of Vi Weston is more of a collection of mannerisms than a character. When she's at the top of her game, she's one of the greatest actresses ever. Other times, she's the epitome of an over-rehearsed and forced theatric performance. Perhaps that's appropriate for this adaptation of a stage play, here in August: Osage County, but not when it's not in tune with the rest of the film's aspects. In fact, the film doesn't really transcend the stage with its unimaginative approach. It'd be better off adapted to radio, all of it was in the dialogue. It was like Carnage where only a few things actually happened, the main one they put on the poster. It's built on soap opera-esque drama where characters scream how they feel with all emotions on edge, Julia Roberts being particularly guilty of this.Character development is designed around random anecdotes and profound baloney the author made up to make characters sound interesting but I never really bought that they would actually think that. Although it's somewhat entertaining to watch a dozen A-list actors sit together at a table and let loose but there's nothing truly relatable or human here. But that's fine, this type of film has its own delights. There's a good portion of the cast who deliver poignant moments such as Julianne Nicholson, Margot Martindale, Chris Cooper and Benedict Cumberbatch who are really compelling to watch and seem to be the only actors truly comfortable in this environment without overdoing it. The trailer makes August: Osage County look like an uplifting family occasion, but it's a melancholic movie with open wounds on a tender spot. It's satisfying if you're prepared or open to it, but it's not for everyone.6/10",August - Osage County
71,OJT,"Well acted by brilliant cast, but a bit forced story",6,11 March 2014,"The trailer for this reminded me of two great dysfunctional family drama comedies, ""Festen"" (""The Celebration"") and ""Another happy day"" which I thoroughly enjoyed. August: O.C. has gotten some good reviews, but the above films are way better written, though i must say I also enjoyed parts of this.This kind of comedies are an own kind. And I guess it's good to laugh a bit about other tragedies. There's always someone worse off, isn't there.It's a story about an extremely dysfunctional family coming back together when the father goes missing. And it's tragic, this family event, which makes everything come to the surface, just like we've seen at this kind of family tragedies. This is not so much a comedy filled with black humor as the others mentioned. It's mixed with life tragedies. Maybe you've got to know a dysfunctional family to appreciate this film, or even be a part of it. If you like these kind of films, there's others than ""The Celebration"" and ""Another happy day"" to recommend: ""Cabin fever""/(""Når nettene blir lange""), ""In bed with Santa""/(""Tomten er far til alla barnen"") and even ""Hotel New Hampshire"" though I haven't seen the latter since it came out. Anyway, this is beautifully acted, not only by the two Oscar nominees Meryl Streep (Best actress in a leading role) and Julia Roberts (Best actress in a supporting role) bit the rest are doing their bit. Simply great.What's holding the story down, I think is the forced manuscript. It's difficult to believe in, and then it should have been more funny. I think there's some really greats scenes, like the dinner, but it slows too much down several times along the road to be a really great film.Still, if you like a great acted stage play turn into film, this is a good one!",August - Osage County

I've probably seen every flick ever made about this state with the littlest panhandle, as least since Oscar Best Picture winner CIMARRON. AUGUST: OSAGE COUNTY kills two birds with one stone for me. First of all, NONE of the 11 characters who appear to be White people live lives worth envying. Only their hard-working, skillful Native American cook has the least sense of morals, attacking the Florida pothead with a shovel before he can have sex with the 14-year-old granddaughter. This proves my theory that Europeans are more out of place in Oklahoma than they are in South Africa. Secondly, director John Sayles had reinforced the incest rap we Texans have been living down at least since the original version of our chainsaw massacre with his LONE STAR hatchet job. Well, that's now water under the proverbial bridge, since AUGUST (like LONE STAR, a movie meant to be taken seriously) features TWO GENERATIONS of brother-sister Hanky Panky. People on the Coasts love to point out our faults any time something like the Kennedy Assassination or Katrina happens in the Old South, but what they don't realize is that the residents of the 25 southern and western states can soothe themselves through any crisis by saying, ""At least we're not from Oklahoma!""

To some extent.August Osage County tells live of Weston family who come back together after the head of family commits suicide.August Osage County is directed by John Wells who previously directed The Company Men. The film takes some time to gather steam as the momentum is very slow. Even after things becomes interesting, you are not grabbed into the film completely. Screenplay is loose and direction is immature. There are few moments in which character are loud and irritating. Art direction is decent. Cinematography is excellent. Background score is weak.

74,napierslogs,Two great scenes defining three women and a whole cast of greatness,9,31 January 2014,"""August: Osage County"" is set in Oklahoma during the summer. The time of year when the temperature and tempers rise up. But of course sometimes it is provoked. The film is based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning play by Tracy Letts, so we can guarantee that this dysfunctional family will come to a head with no easy route to escape.The always great Meryl Streep plays Violet Weston who is not an easy woman to live with. One daughter has stayed (but she gets told she doesn't wear enough makeup), another daughter has run away and not grown up, and the oldest daughter escaped to live her own life. While her husband is ready to kill himself, and so he does in the first scene of the movie. This brings the entire clan back together and life is going to get worse for all of those still living. Ivy (Julianne Nicholson) is the daughter who stayed but she has a secret that shows she's ready to move on with her life; Barbara (Julia Roberts) is the eldest daughter and she's returning home with an ex-husband (Ewan McGregor) and a teenage daughter (Abigail Breslin) who's in the midst of rebellion. Karen (Juliette Lewis) is the middle daughter who's coming home with a new fiancé (Dermot Mulroney) who in one quick introductory scene shows that he is bad news. Violet's sister (Margo Martindale) and brother-in-law (Chris Cooper) are also there to help. But oranges also don't fall far from the tree and we meet their son Little Charles (Benedict Cumberbatch) who is more abused than all three Weston sisters combined.I can understand the complaints of this movie being too slow, as it does take a while for things to come to a boil. Violet seems to love watching her clan simmer. But for fans of movies based on plays we know the action will come eventually. There are two big breaking points. The first occurs at night with Violet sleeping and the rest of the characters responding to recent drama of their own doing. This drives half of the cast away. The second occurs with just three remaining Weston women and Violet just sitting there watching chaos unfold that she created but did not explicitly cause.All the acting and all the characters were powerful, specifically Streep and Roberts as mother and daughter who, simultaneously, were as similar and as separate as you can get. The final scene was breathtaking in its simple execution and conclusive word on who really takes after whom.There is one character who has not yet been mentioned. The one character not played by a Hollywood superstar and the one character who didn't belong to this dysfunctional family. Johnna (Misty Upham) is a Native American hired at the beginning of the film to watch over Violet. And so she does. She is present in every defining scene and provides a point of view for those who don't feel like they belong in ""August: Osage County"".",August - Osage County
75,blott2319-1,"2 hours of family bickering, pure torture",2,1 October 2020,"Ever been to a family dinner and had to sit through the awkwardness when two people get into an argument in front of everyone? That's just a horrible experience, and all you want to do is get up and walk away. Well, August: Osage County is a film entirely made up of those moments. And it's not just two people bickering, it's the entire household. It's like torture listening to all these vile people as they tear one another down and show nothing but disdain for their relatives. Every minute of this film is frustrating, and I had no desire to continue watching this dysfunctional family falling apart. I'd love to say that it is an actor's film, so at least you get some good acting performances, but there's no real range required here. Everyone is consistent from beginning to end at being various levels of angry, with the exception of a couple characters who are clueless idiots through the whole film. Ewan McGregor and Benedict Cumberbatch are also thrown in so we can listen to them struggling to carry an American accent. Even when certain plot twists come later in the film, I was disinterested because the characters on the whole were all despicable, so I didn't care that they had additional things piled on to keep them in anger mode. The only positive I could find in August: Osage County is that my family appears so much better by comparison. I'd rather run miles in the sweltering heat of an Oklahoma August than sit through this movie again.",August - Osage County
76,brchthethird,A family-centered drama where secrets are revealed and feelings are hurt,7,14 November 2014,"AUGUST: OSAGE COUNTY is an interesting film for me. It was written by Tracy Letts, who also wrote two of my favorite William Friedkin films, BUG and KILLER JOE. It also has one of the best ensemble casts ever assembled, in my opinion. However, in contrast to the two William Friedkin films, this one doesn't feel as much like a play. That works for it, and against it. It works for it because the action isn't necessarily confined to one or two locations, and the narrative doesn't feel so claustrophobic. Still, that claustrophobic nature is what worked for those two, and here I thought the film could have benefited from feeling a little smaller. None of the scenes were bad, by any stretch, but a lot of them felt like padding. In other words, they were very much on the periphery of the central story. Still, the performances delivered by the cast were awards-worthy, especially Meryl Streep, who disappeared into her role as the Weston family matriarch.The story is quite simple: A family crisis arises in the Weston family, which prompts them to reunite at the family home in Osage County, Oklahoma. This serves as the catalyst for a lot of secrets to come out, which alter the relationships between them. In this respect, it's similar to Tracy Letts' other plays, because of a single incident that sets the plot in motion. Seemingly insignificant, it actually turns out to have a larger effect than it seemed to at first, with wider implications for everyone involved. Letts excels at making this type of intimate drama, although at times this particular adaptation devolves into histrionics and enters ""kitchen sink"" territory. By that, I mean that the intense dialogue exchanges often feel like actors putting on a show. Being mean-spirited is fine with me, but a lot of the time I could tell it was just actors acting. That being said, the cast was incredible. Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts were the two standouts, but my personal favorite was Margo Martindale as Mattie Fae. There was a down-home quality and naturalness to her performance that I can only assume comes from her as a person. I also thought Chris Cooper did an excellent job with his role as Uncle Charlie.Overall, while the acting is top-notch the story feels a little too large for the material being presented and despite the great cast, it often felt like an excuse for them to just riff off of each other instead of tell a story. This did make for some excellent individual scenes, though. For example, the dinner scene with the entire cast around the table felt real and honest, and is probably the closest the film got to what I liked about the previous Letts adaptations. The film could have been more stripped down, in my opinion, but the high-caliber cast and performances are enough to warrant a watch.",August - Osage County
77,proud_luddite,The play was better,6,14 September 2019,"Based on the play by Tracy Letts (who also wrote the film's screenplay), an extremely dysfunctional extended family reunites in rural Oklahoma after one of its members has gone missing.This film has an A-list cast who do a great job as an ensemble especially during a powerful dinner scene in the first half. Among the standout performances, the great Meryl Streep shines yet again as a crazy matriarch addicted to prescription pills. Whether we in the audience detest her or pity her, few others could do so well in such a difficult role.Streep and Julia Roberts have been given most of the credit and attention during this awards season but there is another performance that was equally deserving: that of Chris Cooper. He's quite good as one of the few characters that has common sense and decency. His best scenes include one where he shows compassion to a very troubled character and another where he rightly tears a strip off someone who deserves it.Years ago, I saw a great stage production of the play. While the movie is loyal to the story, it might be one of those situations where the screen doesn't work as well as the stage. In the screen version, the many shockers and downers seemed a bit much while they seemed perfect on the stage.I wanted to like this film a lot. It was based on a great play. It has a stellar cast and that rarity in the film world - many great roles for actresses. But despite my desire, I could like this movie only so much. - dbamateurcritic",August - Osage County
78,maurice_yacowar,Crumbling family encapsulates national breakdown,8,24 January 2014,"""Now don't go all Carson McCullers on me,"" Barbara Watson (Julia Roberts) admonishes, but that's just what Tracy Letts does in the play and consequent screenplay for August: Osage County. The over-the-top Southern Gothic characters with their florid, acrid relationships seep out into the Oklahoma plains — and beyond, until this tragically fractured family characterizes contemporary America as a whole.This darkly dysfunctional family has been ruined by a long line of mean mothers. The characters expected to provide warmth, love, understanding, forgiveness, are instead a succession of cold, selfish harridans that make the family relationships feel — as the wiser Ivy (Julianne Nichoison) remarks — like a random array of molecules. This nuclear family implodes. Its every branch is torn apart, defined by mutual alienation not connection. This family tears the Hallmark veil off the Republicans' ""family values"" and exposes the nation as amoral, selfish, greedy, vicious, unforgiving and yet for all that — self-righteous. When Karen (Juliet Lewis) admires her parents for staying married for so long, she has to be reminded her father just killed himself — because of his wife's self-absorption. Karen — now willfully blind — preserves her engagement to her fiancé (Ewan Macgregor), however soured their Belize honeymoon, after he has been caught trying to seduce her 14-year- old niece with pot.Matriarch Violet's (Meryl Streep) recollection of her mother's response to her wish for new cowgirl boots epitomizes the generation that takes pleasure in denying the next generation its dreams. Coquettishly the iron-fisted Violet says the unjacketed men make the funeral dinner look ""like a cockfight."" As if she has left any of the men any manhood. As she says, ""Nothing slips by me."" But no-one close emerges unscathed.If the men are more sympathetic it's because they are weaker. Little Charles (Benedict Cumberbatch) will carry that diminution to his grave, as even his romantic escape is doomed by the family's past. Even the relatively sensitive Charles (Chris Cooper) can't resist embarrassing the young vegetarian. He finally stands up to his wife's abuse of their son, unaware that he's not his son. His eulogy to Beverly (Sam Shepard) is similarly based on his own blindness. Shepard's brief appearance leaves echoes of warmth and decency but we later learn of his remoteness and irresponsibility. As the family father, intellect and grey eminence he's the Thomas Jefferson figure, for his own primal sin will paralyze his descendants across the generations.It's August so the rooms swelter and the plains burn gold.

79,dglink,A Stellar Cast of Pros Hang Out the Dirty Linen,8,23 January 2015,"The Weston family has more than its share of misery, and the family linen is hung out for all to savor in ""August: Osage County,"" a verbal feast for a bevy of talented actors. While the familial angst premise has been well trodden in other films, the cast treats the dialog as though penned by Albee, O'Neill, or Williams. A tired aging man with a sick nagging wife, who is addicted to prescription medicine and alcohol, disappears abruptly and subsequently commits suicide. The sudden death prompts a reluctant reunion of his three daughters, his wife's sister, and assorted husbands, fiancés, and offspring at the family home that rises amidst a bleak Oklahoma landscape. The ensuing clashes between siblings, spouses, parents and children produce recriminations, revelations, and the expected verbal fireworks reminiscent of such ""let it all hang out"" classics as ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,"" ""Carnage,"" ""Long Day's Journey into Night,"" and even ""The Lion in Winter."" Adapted by Tracy Letts from her own play, the film does not reach the heights of those other filmed plays. However, like them, the movie remains close to its stage roots, although director John Wells departs from the claustrophobic interiors and into the emptiness outdoors as much as possible. However, the dark, shadowy, airless interiors incubate the familial drama. The window shades are pasted to the glass, not only to shut out the light, but to block the passage of day into night and time itself. Within the over-heated rooms, where even tropical birds cannot survive more than a day, stormy battles ignite over funeral dinners and catfish lunches.Letts has provided the outstanding cast with juicy material, and all rise to the occasion. As Violet Weston, Meryl Streep provides another superlative performance as the cancer-ridden matriarch, a first cousin to Katharine Hepburn in ""Long Day's Journey into Night,"" and Julia Roberts is a near-match for Streep as the eldest daughter with a troubled marriage and a rebellious daughter. Both Streep and Roberts received well deserved Oscar nominations. But the rest of the stellar cast is equally deserving. Juliette Lewis is amusing as the daughter whose latest man intends to take her to Belize and make her his fourth wife. Sam Shepard under-plays his relatively short introductory role as the father, and Chris Cooper has some outstanding scenes including a rebuke to his wife over her constant berating of their son. Ewan McGregor, Benedict Cumberbatch, Margo Martindale, Julianne Nicholson, Abigail Breslin, and Dermot Mulrooney add further able support.While ""Osage County"" may not break new ground, dysfunctional family gatherings are always fun to attend, especially when the family, like the Westons, have so much dirt and venom to spill and include such a host of seasoned performers at their best. Some may look at the cast and think ""Osage County"" is a ""woman's film,"" a deservedly derided term. While the film is indeed about women, strong women, their stories are not unique to gender, and ""August: Osage County"" has broad adult appeal.",August - Osage County

For an actress so iconic, she completely loses herself in this role to the point where she is barely recognizable. Julia Roberts is outstanding, WOW, she's still got it.

81,cultfilmfan,August: Osage County,10,20 January 2014,"August: Osage County is another example of a film where you have excellent writing and a brilliant ensemble cast delivering the already strong material and what you get is almost cinematic perfection and a joy to watch for anyone who loves good writing and acting. The film is based on a play by Tracy Letts, who here adapts his own play for the movie. The film focuses on a large family and all the dysfunction in it and all the dirty laundry and everything that comes out after the family is reunited. This is a film that features strong character study and development of it's characters throughout the course of the film. When you watch the film, it is very easy to see that the film was based on a play as a lot of scenes just involve the characters around each other and the film has little to no action, but is full of plenty of dialogue which can be hurtful, humorous and in some cases perhaps, just plain honest and it is always a joy to watch. For those who find films about dysfunctional families difficult to watch because of the language, fighting and verbal and physical abuse going on, then this probably is not the film for you. While parts of this film were certainly more in the way of tragedy because of just how pathetic and low this family has gotten, there are also moments during the film that may make you laugh, although sometimes you may feel a little guilty afterwards for doing so. Watching this family interacting with one another the way they do and with their very eccentric and oddball characters and personalities, sometimes watching them interact and eventually imploding on contact was very entertaining to watch, again because of the film's strong writing and stellar cast. There is also more to the film than what meets the eye as it deals with many issues that have scarred this family and probably made things as bad between one another as they currently are. Even though some of the material and situations in the film seem really far fetched and a little out there, there was never a time during this film, where I felt it wasn't believable. I have seen dysfunction in families before, both on and off the cinema and television screens and with people I used to know and through various encounters in life and nothing in August: Osage County, really seemed like it couldn't happen. It all seemed believable enough to me and that was one of the film's strong points. While some of the language and interactions with some of the characters are quite shocking to witness, it brings back memories of things I have witnessed in real life being at friend's homes and just having to deal with dysfunction and people suffering from it, whether through my job at work, or through people I know now, or used to know, or maybe just all the time I have spent in front of a television set, or a movie screen seeing what is really a tragic and unfortunate thing, becoming all the more the norm in today's society. Today we have people who delight in watching daytime soap operas revealing each other's secrets and personal information and all the fighting and furniture throwing you can want to watch is right there Monday to Friday, on daytime television. Again we also have reality television shows where people get enjoyment out of seeing the pain and misfortune of others broadcast to millions of people around the world. This is becoming an everyday thing now, so when we watch a dysfunctional group as in August: Osage County, it doesn't shock us as much as it should, because this type of behaviour is becoming all the more the normal and accepted way of life in today's society. While, I was watching August: Osage County, several people were laughing at it in scenes that I found to be shocking and in some ways, just plain sad because of how low both the audience and the characters in the film have sunk. I do not hold this as a complaint against the film, but rather something I really admired about it. I admired that it had the courage to show this type of dysfunction and that family reunions for some really are a difficult time. The characters in this film all really badly needed therapists, or just some one to take their years of anger and aggression out on to get it out, instead of the way they attack each other in the film, sometimes both verbally and physically. August: Osage County, was certainly an eye opener in that way and it was handled beautifully by the film's strong direction, writing and acting. You have an A list cast here that are all deserving of awards for their performances. While, August: Osage County, is not a warm and fuzzy movie to sit through, there are times of humour, self reflection and just excellent character study that really sends home a message and make you contemplate about what you just saw. This is one of the most powerful and at the same time entertaining and well done films of 2013 and it is one of my favourites of last year.",August - Osage County

The basis of the movie is to show you a full glimpse of a dysfunctional family, how it got there and how it's passed down through generation. The acting is amazing and extremely believable, the filming is great, I just wish the movie would have had more of a story to tell, or a little faster at its pace. The film definitely has a strong message to tell its audience and perhaps is very relatable to many.

84,petarmatic,Excellent acting but unrealistic plot.,6,4 February 2014,"What I liked about this film is excellent acting, but I did not like unrealistic plot. What is not realistic about it? Well, in the few years I spent in the Midwest I found that people are really nice but not that intelligent about world and I could not find that many people I could engage in the humanistic themes. Most of them are Republicans and they want to solve problems via the bullets, grenades and tanks. Well, that is sometimes needed but I do not think that the USA can really get involved in the war with everyone in the world.Well, in any case actors do not fit Oklahoma. All that groomed and California way of life do not match Oklahoma surroundings, but I guess they had to shoot some films in the Midwest because Oklahoma film Commission would not have anywhere to place its money.All in all what a portrayal of a dysfunctional family, wow!

There are no words to describe Meryl Streep's performance. She is beyond fantastic and in a league all her own. And what a transformation.It's actually a very gritty film and quite crude. The whole thing just showcases one families pitiful dysfunctional dramas and proves some people just shouldn't reproduce as they continue in their warped unhealthy cycle.The story never was not sad and pathetic. I know deep down they all seem to care but they are horrible and awkward. The whole thing came off like a two hour intervention.Aside from the mess that was their lives there is no real concept or storyline. The whole movie stayed at a messily high climax instead of following a traditional beginning, middle, end format. It made it hard to watch and desensitised some of the outrageous moments.

It's a great film, perfect pace, fantastic to look at and the acting is just amazing.There are some people who get a little annoyed at Meryl Streep always getting nominated for Oscars etc etc but on the basis of this film it's no surprise. She is truly astounding.Day 1 for me I saw this today and LOVED it. I saw the play when it was on B'way (which is incomparable), but I thought Lett's did a great job translating it to the screen, and the acting was top-notch. Meryl and Julia were phenomenal, of course, but Margo Martindale deserved some love.

88,cinematic_aficionado,A family tale,7,28 March 2014,"A dysfunctional family of strong willed women (a wife plus three daughters) must do the unthinkable and gather together. They do not have a choice in this instance as their father has just died. The matriarch, Violet, brilliantly portrayed by Meryl Streep, is a difficult woman as it is and the pill as well as alcohol abuse only exacerbates her behaviour.There are plenty of skeletons in the closet and although the family are in mourning those skeletons provide a barrier to the full expression of the mourning. Suppressed feelings of resentment, disappointment as well as unsaid bitter words are the elephant in the room. The matriarch though deemed as unbearable by her daughters, yet her spirited personality prevents them from fully confronting her. Except Barbara that is who has taken after her ""beloved"" mum.The audience will be placed in the heart of this post funeral dinner where the emotional flood will come into full force where sadness and substance abuse will cause a Niagra falls - like arousing atmosphere.This is a family tale and like all such tales it entails a personality clash with the diversity of characters and the neatly crafter dialogue to make for an powerful and emotive experience which many of us will be able to connect with.",August - Osage County
89,statuskuo,A Person In Every Family,8,22 June 2014,"I recall learning my grandfather had committed suicide years ago. This was the basis of Tracy Lett's own dissection of a dysfunctional family.I dig this movie a lot. yes, it gets loud and the arguments get really repetitive, and most of the times you do see that you are watching a filmed play (18 minute dinner scene for example). But the characters are really flushed out. This is a difficult thing, for those who attempted to ever make a movie. There's so little time to allow for moments to just breathe. As in the scene where Barb (Julia Roberts), Ewan MacGregor and Violet (Meryl) talk on the porch about the origin of ""Indians."" This little detail sets up a reality to it, as they are suffocated by The Plains. Also what is important to note, is the hard environment of central United States. These are not socialites or uppity crust folk. They are the salt of the Earth and pepper their dialogue with absent minded profanity. It is, in essence, the rawness of the land and its people. As Barb puts it in her drive out to her mother's place, it's beyond her how their people could've looked at the land and committed genocide in hopes of taming the land.I did find it odd that they focused on Abigail Breslin's strange rebellion against Julia Roberts instead of a relationship between her and Violet. It almost feels like the dropped a great opportunity to ""pass on"" history to the grandkid, and NOT Violet's immediate children. They allude to it during the aforementioned porch scene, where Violet laments about not seeing her granddaughter. But her subsequent disinterest in her may also play into her character.A lot of great things to look at here. It's a type of movie that doesn't get made anymore, and people complain all the time, that they don't make movies like this. And I wish there were more. So, here it is!",August - Osage County

91,dragokin,August: Sausage County,4,20 March 2014,"There is the idea, or rather a misconception, that a drama must tackle serious questions and it's success is measured by how uncomfortable the viewers felt. Otherwise it wouldn't be a drama. Whether or not the authors of August: Osage County had that in mind, they assembled a group of unhappy characters and exposed their miseries one by one, sparing the viewers of murder only.At the beginning i felt as if i were looking a theater play brought to big screen, which the subsequent online research confirmed. The actors delivered an excellent performance, yet this i took for granted given the stellar cast.As the story unraveled, it became clear that the family portrayed had more issues than tissues. The writing stayed balanced between realism and subtle mind torment. Misery after misery has been introduced, yet enough time has been left for us to adjust to the new situation and prepare ourselves for the next thing that would befall us.Eventually i started counting how many times someone in the movie smiled or laughed with joy and stayed within the single digit range.",August - Osage County
92,TheSquiss,"Wickedly funny, heartening black comedy with a cast to die for.",8,27 March 2014,"Every year, around awards season, the cries echo across the land: ""There are no decent roles for women of a certain age."" ""There are too few films with women in central roles."" ""Nobody writes for women anymore."" And, every year we need to hear those cries because, largely, it is still the case. But every now and again, along comes a film like August: Osage County that fills the screen with an abundance of fine actresses giving excellent performances in strong roles in a film that gives the emotions a thorough spanking. It's not right that we should wait so long, but what a treat when films like this arrive.Adapted by Tracy Letts from her own stage play and directed by John Wells (The Company Men), August: Osage County throws a family of strong women at us with all their wrinkles, faults, foibles and tantrums, accompanied by the men who support them, manage them, tolerate them and, in most instances, love them.When Violet Weston's (Meryl Streep), husband, Beverly (Sam Shepard) disappears, her sister, Mattie (Margo Martindale), and daughters Barbara (Julia Roberts), Ivy (Julianne Nicholson) and Karen (Juliette Lewis) arrive at the Oklahoma family home to give support, offer unwelcome opinions and inflict damage in their own ways. Family warfare ensues as the women lash out with sharpened tongues and defend themselves though brutal attacks, mostly verbal, occasionally physical, while the men endeavor to survive the onslaught and placate the women, with varying degrees of success.August: Osage County is an absolute joy to watch, with cutting dialogue that tears open hearts and splits sides with laughter. Whilst we may not be as dysfunctional as the family Weston, surely all of us have found ourselves at the wrong end of similar familial barbs and idiosyncrasies. We may not all have drug-addict mothers, venomous aunts, airhead sisters, or devout nieces (Abigail Breslin on superb form as Jean), but there is plenty here that that we can squirm at with uncomfortable familiarity, as well as sufficient to revel in from a safe distance.Both Streep and Roberts are at their frosty best; the former as a cancer-stricken matriarch who anaesthetizes herself with pills and alcohol, the latter as rage-fueled woman whose husband, Bill (Ewan McGregor) has found a younger model. The sparks that fly are fantastic. There is almost visual electricity crackling between the two actresses and when the other characters enter the fray, it all threatens to explode.Wells has gathered a superb cast in this wickedly funny, cruel, black comedy that is wonderfully heartening and painful in equal measures. I didn't know where it was going, I just went along for the ride and, at the culmination, I was delighted there was no specific destination, just a fantastic collection of memories from an eventful journey of barbed scenery.There isn't a false move here amongst the actors, and Letts has been careful to balance the trauma with a sturdy warmth and dark humour. August: Osage County isn't all about strife, there is gentleness from Benedict Cumberbatch, in an unexpected character direction for those who know his work well, and a determined reasonability from stalwart Chris Cooper.August: Osage County is a film to be savoured and watched again. It is a movie about anger, bitterness, angst and understanding; it is fraught, funny and frequently moving and, more than anything, it is real, because August: Osage County is about family.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",August - Osage County
93,davidgee,Unhappy families aren't always different,7,7 February 2014,"Another movie that's already harvested Golden Globes and is nominated for Oscars. Meryl Streep gives a wonderfully fruity performance as Violet: I was at times reminded of Bette Davis as Elizabeth the First! Julia Roberts is also very full-on as the daughter who doesn't take her mother's barbs lying down. Juliette Lewes is on fine form, as is Margo Martindale as Violet's sister and the custodian of a nasty family secret. Ewan McGregor and Benedict Cumberbatch give a good account of themselves (though I wondered why American actors weren't cast); Chris Cooper is always very solid.But - here's where I take issue with Mr Tolstoy - this unhappy family is unhappy in ways we have seen before. It's adapted by Tracy Letts from his stage play and although the action almost entirely takes place in and around Violet's homestead, it doesn't seem overly theatrical. But the drama seems to take a dash of Carson McCullers, a bit of Tennessee Williams, a dollop of O'Neill, a large dose of Edward Albee and mix them all up into a family-sized stew without any particularly fresh ingredients.Worth seeing for the performances, especially Meryl and Julia. I still want Cate Blanchett to win the Big One at the Oscars!",August - Osage County
94,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,A Streepcar Named Desire,6,11 January 2014,"In AUGUST: OSAGE COUNTY, a play-based film using a handful of eclectic characters within a limited space, unexpected twists are some of the most intriguing aspects But let's not give anything away.Like THE BIG CHILL, the plot centers on a group of people, in this case a semi-estranged family, gathered in one large rural house after the death of patriarch Sam Shepard as Beverly Weston, who, along with his blunt pill-popping wife Violet, played by Meryl Streep, begins the story taking enough venomous heat to last a lifetime One can only imagine this man's long, horrible marriage and may sympathize, or for that matter, completely understand his immanent suicide.Violet's returning daughters aren't so lucky, especially her hardy eldest, Barbara. With a cheating husband and moping teenage daughter, Julia Robert's put-upon character is not only Streep's best match, she spouts the surliest dialogue: without being overly medicated as an excuse (her loud mom, ironically, has mouth cancer). Scenes where the two leading ladies argue are intense but can go overboard, making you wish someone would step in to break things up.Nothing doing with this family, a somewhat passive lot including Chris Cooper as the mellow uncle, his discontented wife and a son so fragile he should wear a sticker. While Barbara's other sisters include Julianne Nicholson as Ivy, keeping a secret that, unbeknownst to her, has an uncomfortable layer and Juliette Lewis as Karen who, playing the dizzy-headed youngest, is the least important in the mix. But it really comes down to Streep and Roberts even though, into the third act, mom's part dwindles while Barbara alone holds the key to an already unlocked door. Put simply, Julia's fans should be more satisfied than Meryl's.The direction is crisp and never feels staged, painting a vivid picture that often exceeds an overindulged, melodramatic script with too much edgy banter If a ringside bell clang before each ""couple"" squared off, the soundtrack would be a perpetual alarm clock.Tempered by sporadic flashes of the Oklahoma countryside and/or sunsets, it's clear this melancholy clan spends too much time self loathing when they should appreciate the peaceful, gorgeous exterior. Who knows – maybe that's what poor dad wanted all along.",August - Osage County
95,ClaytonDavis,"""August: Osage County"" is the best ensemble of the year!",8,4 October 2013,"Before I even start to talk about John Wells' new film ""August: Osage County,"" I have to say I've never seen the stage play or read it by writer Tracy Letts. Following the screening, I felt it was important to disclose. An all-star cast is assembled, all which have individual moments to shine, which is surprising with a cast this size, and for the most part, the film succeeds on multiple levels. Sure to be divisive, ""August: Osage County"" is tenacious and beautifully constructed. Soulful and unafraid to show the gritty and ugly of the American family, Wells' film is utterly compelling. A must-see for the awards season. An instant Oscar contender.From the top to the bottom, this film exists and succeeds by its performances. At the top of the heap and best in show is the stunning and beautiful Oscar-winning actress Julia Roberts. Her turn as Barbara Weston is in the top three performances she's ever delivered. Roberts dives into herself in a way we haven't seen since ""Erin Brockovich."" The narrative fully turns on her character and in the final half of the film, she pulls the train through to the station. I'm incredibly impressed with her work. Roberts is a revelation and reminds the world how good she really is. A sure-fire Oscar contender.As Violet Weston, a role played by Deanna Dunagan on Broadway, there were high expectations to see what 3-time Academy Award Winner Meryl Streep would bring to the role. For the past few years, I've begged for Streep to ""dirty it up"" and play a role like this. A drug-addicted matriarch who a gutter mouth lets Streep give a fresh take on a character. Her performance is middle of the road for what Streep has delivered in her career. That can mean different things to different people. Middle of the road for Streep could be the best of any actor. I walked out of the theater feeling the same way I felt following the end credits of ""Doubt."" Streep excels in many areas of acting, but I feel when it comes to stage adaptations to the big screen, Streep doesn't live in the character as comfortably as she would in any other role. There are times that the role does go a bit over-the-top. That being said, Streep is still plenty great as she's been in other roles as of late. She inhabits lots of Violet's beats and mannerisms and gives dynamite exchange with some of her co-stars. It's a performance that will surely land her another Best Actress nomination.Trying to pick any of the supporting characters to single out is like trying to pick your favorite child. Margo Martindale as Mattie Fae is ballsy and spunky and its good to see an actor of her caliber finally getting a chance to rip into a role like this. Her character reveals the film's darkest secret which gives her an edge over some of her co- stars, which Wells directs masterfully with DP Adriano Goldman.I could eat Benedict Cumberbatch up with a spoon. As ""Little Charles,"" he definitely has the narrative's most sympathetic story but more importantly, in a film that is full of despicable people, he manages to pull the audience in to root for him, even when you know he's doing something terribly wrong.I've longed for Juliette Lewis to get back in Oscar's graces following her nomination over twenty years ago in Martin Scorsese's ""Cape Fear."" She as dynamic as we've seen her in the last few years, delivering her best turn yet as Karen. A true professional. Ewan McGregor continues to elevate himself as one of our finest actors working today as Bill, Barbara's estranged husband. As someone who is on the opposite side of the rational spectrum when compared the Weston ladies, McGregor stands out as a positive take. Unfortunately, he only gets one scene to really let loose in a memorable manner. I can recall being floored by the work of Julianne Nicholson in the little indie that no one saw, ""Flannel Pajamas"" nearly seven years ago. I've never fully revisited her work since despite stints on ""Conviction"" and ""Law & Order: Criminal Intent."" As Ivy, the one sister that stayed behind, Nicholson embraces her natural and simplistic mannerisms that give her role a much-needed arc in the narrative. In a perfect world, we would be looking at Julianne Nicholson for serious Oscar consideration.Brief but all too clear as perfection, Sam Shepard ignites his brief screen time as Beverly Weston, the patriarch of our family. Same could be said for Misty Upham as Johnna, our Native American housekeeper sitting as a silent observer.Academy Award winner Chris Cooper shines when he takes on sensitive and accessible performances. With a tough exterior but a soft and loving emotional center, Cooper acts as an sentimental pillar to our tale. If there is room for a man in an Oscar lineup from a film dominated by women, he is likely it.Director John Wells has a strong hold on the material. He understands where he wants the narrative to go, putting an emphasis on the story and letting any directorial styles take a backseat. It's definitely appreciated in a story that has so many moving parts. Writer Tracy Letts adapts his own play and in the second half really stretches out his legs as the story takes shape for certain characters. The first thirty minutes are rough. The dialogue isn't as quick as snapping your finger. Some monologues run a little long and there are a pair of instances where I checked out of the story for a moment.The Weinstein Company have quite a gem on their hands. Lots of heart and laughs, ""August: Osage County"" has the year's best cast ensembles and is one of the year's best films.Read More of the Review @ (http://www.awardscircuit.com)",August - Osage County

97,ArchonCinemaReviews,The kitchen sink of family dysfunction,3,2 August 2014,"Adapted from the 2008 Pulitzer Prize winning play of the same name, August: Osage County is what you expect in an Oscar nominated film.The tale of the troubled Weston family told over the course of a few weeks in Oklahoma as a disjointed family comes together when the sole male and patriarch goes missing.Dysfunctional is almost an understatement when it comes to the Weston family's problems. You name the depressing affliction and they have it. Incest? Yup. Cancer? Yup. Molestation? Yup. Suicide? Yup. Drug addiction? Yup. Divorce and Separation? Yup. Infidelity? Yup. Racism? Yup. Child Abuse? Yup. While this 'everything but the kitchen sink' mish-mosh of gloomy subject matter is not entirely the fault of the director, since it is an adaptation of Tracy Letts' creation, it comes across as heavy handed and excessive in the film.The acting can partially be to blame, as it is as graceless as the plot. Meryl Streep does as she always does, she transforms. But you cannot shake that underneath the wig and make up it is still Meryl Streep playing the pill popping verbally abusive matriarch, Violet Weston. Julia Roberts does a better job playing the daughter who got away, Barbara. I believe the star is Julianne Nicholson, who plays Ivy, the dismissed and criticized daughter burdened with the task of caretaker of the house. Hopefully this film can act as a catalyst for her career because she shines, as does her partner in the film, Benedict Cumberbatch.The film reeks of ""Academy Award"" material as a product of the Weinstein brothers, but is undeserving of taking home the prestigious accolade in any category. Though fine as a dramatic film it is no tour de force. It lacks the longevity of presence and will probably be forgotten within a few years.And don't forget to check out our website for more movie reviews!",August - Osage County

This movie got the ""Hollywood loves it"" awards so my wife and I thought we'd give it a shot: BIG MISTAKE! We kept waiting for it to get better. It is 90 minutes of a family reunion going terribly wrong with acid spewing from their mouths and terrible secrets spilling out. We waded through the sewage waiting for a payoff that never came.

A mesmerizing movie to watch, first class actors spreading their wings, and still something just isn't right. Maybe the play borrowing a bit from Tennessee Williams, some from Edward Albee seems a bit contrived. Somehow a play that actors would kill for is in return killing actors.

You're a good, decent, funny, wonderful woman, and I love you but, you're a pain in the ass!""

103,shawneofthedead,A satisfying - if not quite as subtle - adaptation of the smash-hit Broadway play.,8,22 January 2014,"Anyone who's had the pleasure - and horror - of watching Tracy Letts' Tony-winning August: Osage County onstage would almost certainly approach its movie adaptation with trepidation. Huge and sprawling at three-and-a-half hours long (with two intermissions), the play nevertheless unfolded like an intimate chamber piece: a take-all-prisoners approach to the genre of sordid family drama.Surely a Hollywood film jam-packed with bankable stars and hoping to make rather than lose money would water down the play's darkest twists and deepest secrets - a suspicion apparently confirmed by the curiously upbeat trailer. Happily, August: Osage County retains the same desperately dysfunctional bite and spark it did on Broadway, even if it loses a good amount of shocks and subtlety in shaving an hour and a half off its running time.The disappearance of patriarch Beverly Weston (Sam Shepard) serves as the emergency that unites his family in Osage County in the blazingly hot month of August. Grief and uncertainty have seemingly little impact on Violet (Meryl Streep), his bitter, cancer-stricken wife with an unholy dependence on drugs and cigarettes. In what one soon gathers is characteristic form, Violet doles out bile and loathing to her three daughters: strong-willed Barbara (Julia Roberts), whose marriage to writer Bill (Ewan McGregor) is slowly disintegrating; dutiful Ivy (Julianne Nicholson), who finally decides to plan for a better future with her cousin Little Charles (Benedict Cumberbatch); and flighty Karen (Juliette Lewis), who turns up with her new sleazy businessman-fiancé Steve (Dermot Mulroney) in tow.The pitch-black brew of drama, comedy and tragedy that is Letts' August: Osage County takes a considerable while to get going. The introduction of the Westons and their extended family - including Violet's sister Mattie Fae (Margo Martindale), brother-in-law Charles (Chris Cooper), and Native American helper Johnna (Misty Upham) - is rushed and lacking in much of the subtlety laced throughout the play. Letts, who adapted his script into a screenplay, hands us morsels of information that are more hard-won onstage. Violet's cancer of the mouth becomes a punch-line rather than a revelation, and Beverly - a ghostly spectre concocted from words and memories who haunts his family onstage - actually exists as a corporeal presence in the film. Everything is just a little too loud and a little too obvious.But, almost imperceptibly, John Wells' adaptation finds its feet, and this blistering portrait of a family in breakdown comes sharply into focus, cracks and all. Streep presides over a crackerjack dinner-table sequence - as thrilling, horrifying and hilarious on screen as it is onstage - that's perhaps the most exhilarating, awful scene you'll ever see constructed out of insults, secrets and shame. Violet hurls abuse at her relatives with the expertise of experience, switching from poisonous to sympathetic in a beat of her hateful, broken heart. They react in varying ways: Barbara with a white-hot rage, Ivy with a tremulous sweetness that explains why she never managed to free herself from her mother's strangling grasp.The power balance shifts as the narrative does: Violet may be the ostensible lead character of the film, but every member of her family tells his or her own tale of heartbreak and guilt. Barbara, in particular, tries to keep it all together in the face of a domineering mother, a husband who's probably already drifted too far away from her, and a daughter (Abigail Breslin) intent on rebelling in the stupidest and most natural of ways. She's the raw, beating heart of a tragic third act, in which the responsibility for the family's most scandalous and malevolent of secrets lands squarely on her shoulders.It's why Roberts' candidacy in the Best Supporting Actress race is unfortunate but necessary. Given how crowded the acting categories are this year with brilliant performances, she would have been completely overlooked if she had submitted her name in the same category as Streep (where it really belongs). Make no mistake, though: this is easily the best work Roberts has ever done. As she comes to the sad realisation that she is very much her mother's daughter, Barbara is as dazzling as she is brutal and miserable in her anger.Streep, of course, does what she does very well. Her performance is inescapably theatrical - rightly so, since Violet is a bit of an actress herself. In other words, it's a big, mannered turn that's unlikely to win over her detractors. But it's also masterful: a commanding, vanity-free transformation into a physically ravaged, mentally raving woman who's part gargoyle and all basket case. Streep plays Violet as bitterly, brilliantly cruel in her more lucid moments - but she's also always a breakdown away from a sad, shattered wreck whose meanness is as unforgivable as it is understandable.In a film teeming with great actors, Nicholson and Martindale stand out as well, although their characters have both been robbed of considerable depth in making the journey from stage to screen. Cumberbatch, so effortlessly enigmatic and appealing in BBC's Sherlock, strikes the only false note in the cast: he fills the shoes of Little Charles well enough, but doesn't quite nail the character's heart or hopelessness.In essence, August: Osage County is a meditation on family and the ties that will always call you home - for better or, in the case of the Westons, for worse. It may have lost a little of its complexity in moving from Broadway to Hollywood but, in all the ways that count, it remains a rich, dark and most devastatingly poisonous family drama.",August - Osage County

If you think you have a dysfunctional family take a look at this film. Meryl Streep plays Violet, a pill popping drug addict who is married to Beverly, an alcoholic.

Each one has issues of their own and put them all in the same room, and you have a powder keg waiting to ignite!!!! This is one of those films where, if you can't act it will become immediately apparent and I'm happy to say every single person pulled off a performance they should be proud of. Filled with stars like Ewan McGregor, Benedict Cumberbatch, Juliette Lewis etc there could have been a real competition by the actors to make each scene their own, but this film drew on their individual strengths to put together a family that I'm sure everyone can recognise a small part of.

105,mgd_m,Good but not that compelling,6,27 February 2019,"Grim, brutal family drama where the hand of Tracy Letts is apparent. The characters and dialogues seem very real, far from any big-screen cliché. Each character has a clear, human, well-defined personality.
The story digs deeper and deeper in the dark secrets of the family, at some point being quite shocking.
Acting is terrific.

106,rollernerd,Who wouldnt want to sit for dinner on their family table?,7,20 September 2020,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Today's movie review is the family drama August: Osage County (2014) where an all-star ensemble cast play a dysfunctional family during a family crisis. Based on a play the movie is powerful and full of despicable people which you might find in your own family. There moments of tension and secrets revealed that rocks the family towards the end of the movie. The queen herself, Meryl Streep plays Violet, who is recovering from cancer and because of her condition has a drug abuse problem. Her husband passes away and her three daughters, her sister along with their families rock up for a few interesting days.From the get go the acting is so terrific, the character portrayals are so strong where you feel how each family member reacts to the emotions running through the family. The daughters are so different from each other and to the situation where you have Barbara, played by Julia Roberts, is hard and tough like her mother, Ivy keeps her feelings and thoughts to herself and Karen is a dingbat looking for love, probably in all the wrong places. The main theme of the movie is the consequences of anger and pain caused by keeping secrets. Julia Roberts gives a great performance and is toe to toe against Streep. Violet's sister Minnie played by Margo Martindale, does well as a woman who is so bitter yet ensures to her nieces she was once different until of course life changed her. Streep is great as by playing someone who is carrying so much weight from the pain of her illness and her loss that it has affected everyone in the family and the eyeballing she gives to certain family members on the dinner table is so spiteful and commanding. Overall a great acting performance flick - 7.8/10",August - Osage County
107,SilverOrlov,Acting masterpiece,9,18 March 2020,"After I watched more than a couple of thousands of films, I became very picky about evaluating the plot, the cliches, the stupidity of the characters or the story itself, the acting, and how much I can predict the plot.
This film is, by and large, one continuous dialogue within the same one family, but it is one of the best films I have ever seen. The relatively simple story of the conflict within the family members is incredibly given by good actors and unmatched music at precisely the right moments.
Highly recommended and definitely will be in my private collection.",August - Osage County
108,squirrel_burst,"Feels more like a play than a movie, but it's a good play!",8,28 February 2015,"Whenever a film based on a play comes out, the big question is ""What does this big-screen version bring that I couldn't get out of seeing it live, with actors on stage?"" In the case of the 2013 production of ""August: Osage County"", it's powerhouse performances so good you'll be as energized as you would be if the actors and actresses were right there in front of you. Featured here are Meryl Streep, Julia Roberts, Ewan McGregor, Chris Cooper, Abigail Bresling, Juliette Lewis and Benedict Cumberbatch. What's it about? A strained family get together at the parent's house during an unusually hot August. Beverly Weston (Shepard) is the alcoholic patriarch who used to be a noted writer but has since devolved into a depressed mess. He disappears, prompting the mother Violet (Streep, who looks like she's aged 10 years for the role) to call in the daughters and immediate family for some support. She wasn't exactly a nice woman to start off with, so you can imagine her family is less than thrilled to come see her when she's in this situation. Nobody really gets along so you can bet drama's just around the corner.When I say drama, I don't mean that kind of sad drama about people revealing their love and regrets to each other; I'm talking about screaming, fighting, power struggles and old hatreds rearing their ugly heads. Pretty much everyone involved has a big revelation to share with the rest of the family and as more and more is revealed, it gets worse and worse until everyone blows up. At the center of it all is Violet. You've heard of mothers that are rude, abrasive and have that knack for getting under the skin of everyone around her. Now imagine that person with absolutely no control over her mouth. She's using her illness (mouth cancer) as an excuse to be as cruel as the worst villains you've seen, but you don't know what to make of her. Is it OK to hate a woman that's suffering from cancer and addicted to drugs? Watch this movie and I think you'll agree with me that yes it is. There is a lot going on in this film in terms of unresolved issues and soon-to-blow powder kegs. I suppose in that way it very much feels like a play and less like a movie but I enjoyed all of the stories. Some characters (I feel a bit guilty admitting this) I even looked forward to seeing them melt down as they were confronted by everyone else. It's entertaining drama.This movie actually has some really funny moments. You're taken aback by some of the comments made by Violet and you can't help but chuckle. There's also something very funny about seeing a family trying to get along when it's clear to everyone, including the people in the room, that they should just invent a story about being an orphan and never come see each other ever again. At a certain point there are just so many dramatic revelations that you just give up and up and laugh as it all goes from bad to worse and then keeps on going until the only word you could use to describe the family would be absolutely catastrophic.A flaw I found is that there's nothing about this that really makes you forget that you are essentially watching a play with a bigger budget. I found that despite the dialog being good, the performances being excellent and the characters being interesting, this story never quite gripped me as much as it should have because there is an air of artifice in every scene. It's not a big flaw in the film but if your ears can't stand the dialog as it is written in plays, I'm not sure how you'll feel about this one. Like I said earlier though, this film has some unforgettable performances and everyone involved is firing on all cylinders. It's the kind of movie that has some re-watch value because even though the surprises will be gone, it'll actually work in the film's favor. You'll be able to sit back and examine the actors and actresses honing their craft to perfection and there's always something satisfying about seeing professional at their best.Seeing the film in a crowded theater is the way to go when it comes to this ensemble piece so I encourage you to watch it on the big screen. Not because of the spectacle, but because it's one of those where hearing people gasp and chuckle out of surprise will enhance the experience significantly. It falls into the trappings of a play, but what ""August: Osage County"" does right earns it a high recommendation. (theatrical version on the big screen, January 30, 2014)",August - Osage County
109,akash_sebastian,Dysfunctional-Family Comedy-Drama At Its Best!,8,12 January 2014,"With a Pulitzer-winning play and stellar cast like this, I went in expecting too much, but thankfully... what a treat it was! Tracy Letts adapts his own brilliant dark comedy-drama for the screen. The wide array of complex characters and situations presented in front of you is astounding and is to be relished. The confrontations and dialogues may seem a bit too dramatic to certain people, but it's captivating to see skillful actors in such scenarios.Meryl Streep plays the dysfunctional mother coping with cancer and drug-addiction (Violet Weston), and the way she gets into the shoes of this refreshingly new character is spectacular. She's there in most of the scenes from beginning till end, but you can never have too much Streep. Julia Roberts plays second lead as Violet's elder daughter who has a kind of turbulent relationship with her mother; Roberts holds her own quite well, and it's pleasant to see her in such a different image without her much-too-famous beautiful wide smile. Her confrontations with Streep form some of the best scenes of the movie. The remaining talented cast, comprising of Chris Cooper, Abigail Breslin, Ewan McGregor, Margo Martindale, Julianne Nicholson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Dermot Mulroney, Sam Shepard and Juliette Lewis... (Phew! The list is endless) everyone plays their part commendably.As I haven't seen the play, the story was completely new to me. So I was really able to savour each and every moment. It's a beautiful and bittersweet story dealing with life, relationships, deception, secrets, loneliness, addiction, anger and all sorts of emotions in between. It's a hell of a ride; a dysfunctional-family comedy-drama at its best.",August - Osage County

112,ghost_dog86,Do all women eventually turn into their mothers?,8,15 January 2014,"After having to endure ""Bug"" and ""Killer Joe"", we finally we get a film adaptation of the only Tracy Letts play that anybody wanted to see. Letts adapts his own Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award winning tragic comedy of arguments (using his original unfortunate title and all) ""August: Osage County"", for the big screen. It centers around a family who reunites after the patriarch goes missing. Now, his three grown daughters, one who's in a broken marriage (Julia Roberts) one who's an unashamed floozy (Juliette Lewis) and one who's pretty much only known as the ignored daughter (Julianne Nicholson) as well as their mother (Meryl Streep) who is a drug addicted, spitefully hilarious, sharp tongued woman who, in a cruel twist of fate, has mouth cancer, and a slew of other characters who all do their parts to add fuel to the fire, are now forced to spend an indeterminate amount of time together until all is resolved. For two hours we watch as this impromptu reunion breeds an amalgamation of colorful conversations/arguments regarding infidelity, incest, drug abuse and pretty much everything that isn't appropriate dinner table conversation. And shockingly, none of it seems forced or convoluted.So, last week I made the proclamation that Leonardo DiCaprio will win the Oscar for his performance in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" simply on the platform that he was cranked up to 11 the entire time. And if it wasn't for Cate Blanchett, the same would go for Meryl Streep in ""August: Osage County"", as she is absolutely unleashed here, steam rolling (for better, not worse) the rest of this brilliant cast. As for Julia Roberts, this may be the best performance of her career, but that's not really saying much.It's not just the brash and relentlessly demonstrative dialogue and the grade A performances which add to the film's effectiveness, it's also Letts' story and ability to not just put a bunch of combative people in a small space and watch the dysfunction ensue, but also interweave these most interestingly layered characters into the most interesting and scathing plot lines.Side Note: With this kind of source material and this caliber of actors reciting Pulitzer Prize winning dialogue, by no fault of his own, John Wells, the director, is really rendered useless here. In the case of ""August: Osage County"" (to throw in a sports analogy) John Wells comes off as a new coach that has inherited a championship team.Final Thought: While there are some lulls in this film which arise as we await the next shocking revelation, and of course with this dialogue comes the understanding that nobody really talks like this, the only thing forgettable about ""August: Osage County"" was the performance of Benedict Cumberbatch (as Little (cousin) Charles) who swings in and out of his natural accent and is barely given anything to do. Overall, I had a good time with this; watching this family crumble in front of my eyes. There are mounds of excellent sequences which kept me wanting more. And Meryl is still da man. What else can I say?",August - Osage County
113,herbqedi,"Terrific Acting not enough to overcome banal script, too many talky characters, and absolutely static direction",4,20 January 2014,"Saw the film this weekend. Streep's performance was excellent - that character could not have been realized any better by anyone! However, the movie itself was a statically filmed version of a wildly overpraised stage play - the supposed shocker elements have been done before to greater effect and with more aplomb, There were too many clichéd characters that even excellent attempts of bringing them to life by the likes of Ewan McGregor, Dermont Mulroney, Juliette Lewis and Abigail Breslin could not make them rise above clichés - and believe me, they tried. As the star-crossed lovers, Juliette Nicholson and Benedict Cumberbatch emphasized the best parts of the dialect they had to terrific and authentic effect and had the perfect awkward chemistry and ways of conveying non-verbally what was left unsaid that were better than the script deserved. Chris Cooper who starred in a much better movie with a far more interesting depiction and resolution of the most ""shocking revelation"" of August: Osage County is absolutely perfect as the brother- in-law who truly loved the deceased and who is sicked by the nastiness and pettiness of the female relatives - especially his wife's (Excellently played by Margo Martindale). The actress playing the native American helper is very good but unexceptional. The actor who faired worst in this - in my opinion - had the meatiest role - Julia Roberts. She tried hard to get the gut-wrenching experience of having the unbearable fact shoved into her face that, in essence, she had become her mother. But, it just seemed more emoting than emotion to me.Overall, I do not recommend seeing the movie despite the terrific performances. Read some Lillian Hellman, Carson McCullers, and Sam Sheppard plays instead.Oh yes, Sheppard is magnificent narrating and acting in the first 10 minutes of the movie. But in many ways, when his character dies, so did the film. The fact that this Director was nominated for Best Director and that Paul Greengrass was not shows the flaws in the Academy system.",August - Osage County
114,ferdinand1932,Long Day's Journey into Oklahoma,7,10 September 2014,"And in this film Streep does Joan Crawford. Well, she's done everyone else and a Crawford impersonation was probably what caps a distinguished career.She does it well, as do the entire female cast who show their skills with a fulsome and at times tough script that allows them to unleash. Julia Roberts is quite stark and forbidding; she also has some of the best and most bruising lines.The background is families and all their secrets. It draws on O'Neill's great play, 'Long Day's Journey into Night'. Addiction, disappointment, and even the greatest of all transgressions, which is the most destructive, coil around the family.The male characters are less well defined; more supportive and mostly weak with glum faces and an odd rebuke. The whole work might have a better balance if this aspect had been revised slightly, and there is scope in it to do so.Ultimately though, the movie belongs to Streep doing a King Lear as Joan Crawford with her three daughters, although they are not Goneril, Regan and Cordelia.",August - Osage County
115,danew13,"Great Acting from Streep, Roberts, Cooper, but not for the Suicidal",6,10 January 2014,"This is an actor's film and not very entertaining for the casual viewer...with very strong performances but not much else. It's also another in the endless American obsession with rural family life. It tells the story when a non functional family get together for a funeral after a suicide...in the end you feel everyone may kill themselves out of despair. The story is long and turgid. Aside from a revelation or two, no one really changes or grows. The film ends as it began in a feeling of hopelessness.Once again Meryl Streep commands the screen, even if her character is totally obnoxious and unlikeable. But Julia Roberts is an able antagonist in her strongest performance since Brockovich. The men in the film have little to say other than Chris Cooper who is the only guy will both balls and morality.

After he turns up dead and is unceremoniously buried, the disconnected family members are left to work out their mother's evil spirit and the proverbial skeletons in the closet. With complimentary over the top acting from just about everyone involved, the film's script is overly dramatic and thoroughly predictable. It really did nothing but outstay its welcome after the 30 minute mark. None of the characters inspire any sympathy and the story itself feels like it was made up as they were going along. Given such an incredible cast, one is left to wonder what any of them saw in this rubbish idea for a film. A typical case of 'all dressed up and nowhere to go'.",August - Osage County
117,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Worth it for Julia Roberts,6,11 January 2014,"As I was watching the film, 2 things really baffled me about the marketing for this film. First of all this be listed as comedy. This is way more of a drama that deals with depressing issues like death,divorce and addiction as examples. American Hustle being listed as a comedy also baffled me, but thats more of a comedy than this is. Secondly, why is Julia Roberts being billed as Supporting. I honestly think she is more of a lead than Meryl. I think she either gets more screen time than Meryl or at least the same amount, and the film seems to be more about her journey. At least the way I saw it.Anyway, things I liked about the film. I thought Julia Roberts did a really good job with the film. I could really feel her pain and frustration at times. I think this is one of her best works. I also thought Benedict Cumberbatch did a really good job with his accent. He sounded very genuinely like an American from the South. He didn't sound like himself at all. As for acting, not his best work out of 2013. I thought he did better in Star Trek : Into Darkness as well as 12 Years a Slave. I thought he was a bit over the top in the scene we first meet him. He was fine in his other few scenes. As for other things I liked, well I liked the scripts in certain parts. I thought there was definitely some strong scenes. Like when Barbara (Julia) loses her cool and tackles her mom to the ground to take her pills away. Or when Mattie Fae (Margo Martindale) confesses that she had an affair with her sister's husband. And that her son Little Charles is actually a brother to all 3 girls. That scene really stuck with me. And I thought Margo delivered it beautifully.As for some of the stuff I didn't like (that hasn't already been mentioned), I thought it was quite long. It's only about 2 hours, and yet feels longer. I'm pretty sure halfway through I was already expecting it to be ending soon. Also, I noticed Ewan's accent slipped a couple times. Also, I felt like Meryl wasn't very natural. It just seemed the whole time that she was playing a part. I just never really bought her. But at least she wasn't as bad as Juliette Lewis. She was pretty horrible in this.So I didn't totally hate the film, but it wasn't the greatest thing I've seen. Except For Julia, I don't think its deserving of any awards.",August - Osage County

It is impossible for surprises yet their performances in Osage brings them both to a higher level. Everyone in this cast is nothing short of spectacular. That is because each actor in the movie gets their own scene and not one disappoints. Meryl Streep is beyond beyond spectacular as she makes acting look so very natural to her. Julia Roberts takes her acting to a new level, we have seen less of her as she raises her family. But make no mistake she is better then ever.

I needn't have. The cast, dominated by Meryll Streep's pill-popping matriarch, and featuring stonkingly good turns by some of my favourite actors - Chris Cooper, Sam Shepard, Benedict Cumberbatch (cast completely against type as a feckless low-rent loser) and the criminally underrated Julianne Nicolson (I know she's ginger and freckly and not 'Hollywood pretty' but I've never seen her give a bad performance, and that's not something that can be said of most thesps) - and equally great turns by people like Julia Roberts (a career best, in my view) and Juliette Lewis (tries a little too hard, but so does her character), is universally excellent. The plot is simple, but it's one which is almost entirely dictated by the shared affections, grievances and secrets of a family who make the Osbournes look like the Watkins. As such it's difficult to discuss without explaining half the plot.

121,priyantha-bandara,Even dysfunctional families are not this dysfunctional,7,17 April 2014,"When movies about dysfunctional families are funny they really make very good laughs. And when they are serious it makes you feel miserable. August: Osage County can be the most interesting of that kind seeing from Hollywood lately. This movie swings in between a drama and a sarcastic dark comedy. And there are plenty of reasons for the movie lovers to gulp this in one go. August: Osage County is based on Tracy Letts Pulitzer prize winning play of the same name. Crowed gatherings in one sitting, lengthy talk sequences, excessive amount of drama and emotions makes you feel the stage presence of some sort. Maybe they were inherited by the original play though the movie takes few steps out of the house and explain some sequences in a different way. But still as a whole everything here takes places under one roof. Barbara Weston (Julia Roberts) is a strong willed eldest daughter of the 3 girls of Weston family. Her mother Violet (Meryl Streep) is a pill addicted cancer patient and an impossible character to deal with. Their collision course was inevitable after the family gathers at the house following a tragic incidence involving their father. Despite the family going through the grieving process they find room to criticize their twisted characters.August: Osage County is a heavily character and acting driven movie. The cast is simply overwhelming to begin with. Meryl and Julia are two incredibly talented performers and both the main and the supporting actresses' roles are played with equal level of power and energy. And then there is Chris Cooper, Ewan McGregor, Benedict Cumberbatch, Juliette Lewis and the cast goes on and on. It is obvious that when you put so many talents like that in to one movie it can either be a blast or a total failure. But August: Osage County manages to survive on the middle ground. If not it could have being a total disappointment. The director John Wells is more known for his TV work (ER -1994, The West Wing -1999) prior to his talked about The Company Men (2010). However August: Osage County does not show real potential as a movie thought it might have being a powerful stage play. Without the cast and splendid acting it could have being easily forgotten. Especially Meryl Streep definitely save this movie a thousand times with her blasting performance which made her nominated for the best actress in 2013 Oscars. And for a moment I stop to wonder if she really deserved it than Cate Blanchett for Blue Jasmine.",August - Osage County
122,CMTiago,Strictly a family affair,7,13 February 2014,"This is a movie whose quality is risen thanks to the performances of brilliant lead actresses. Meryl Streep proves yet again to be at the top of her game and this character could not have been better suited for her. Essencially an actors movie, AOC is at times breathtaking and in the long run a movie with acting of the highest quality. The story itself is a little weak and therefore there is a limit to what this movie can offer. I have not seen the play so I can't draw up comparisons from there. As far as the big screen version goes I found myself enticed at times and rather bored in others. There is one particular scene that eclipses nearly the whole movie. The famed dinner scene is a great, dynamic portrayal of what family is at its deepest core. The supporting cast is a strong enough foundation for the film and without them the leads wouldn't shine as much. Streep's Violet is a strong willed woman with a nasty temper, who sees herself weakened by her pill addiction, in turn caused by her cancer problems. She puts on a feisty attitude while conserving her inner feelings that eventually explode. Out of her three daughters the big standout is Barbra (Roberts) who inherited most of her mother's nature. She is confident and determined, but broken when it comes to her own family's matters. There is a lot of soul in this characters and I don't think any other actresses could have pulled though quite like this. I am not saying others wouldn't be great in their own way, it's just these performances are quite strong already. It is due to these performances that the movie rises higher than it should and personally I believe that these woman should be praised for making the most out of what they were given.Rating 7/10",August - Osage County

When I learned that they were also in this film I had the feeling that the AFI occasion had something to do with it and perhaps it did. Perhaps they had not met before or if they had it may have been in passing, but the AFI MacLaine tribute would be a good opportunity for the two stars to spend some time together and talk about being in a film and this film could be that film. Of course this is all speculation, but who knows how it happened, the fact is that Streep and Roberts in a film together is a real event and I snapped it up when I saw it was in the Redbox kiosk in front of my neighborhood 7/11 and I could barely wait to sit down and watch it which I did in a single sitting, so riveting is this movie. The performances are stellar, no question about it, but then that is what I expected and I was not disappointed. In fact, the entire cast is absolutely wonderful and the plot is always a surprise as it twists and turns to the point where your head is spinning. But for me that is great movie-making, being kept at the edge of my seat, never knowing what will happen next. There are a couple of ""holes"" in the script which are just mildly annoying but I cannot discuss them without having spoilers and that's no fun. Suffice it to say, viewers may notice the ""holes"" but they are not so bad as to ruin the film by any stretch of the imagination.

The result is a compelling, complex narrative with gripping performances, that talks to the universal experience of family, growing old, and hypocrisy. When aging alcoholic grandfather Bev passes away suddenly, the extended family gather for the funeral and old grievances are aired once more, along with revelations that both delight and disappoint. Streep ranges from lost to laser-like vitriol, plausible in every beat, while Roberts is immense, completely dispensing with her American sweetheart persona, managing to go through the whole film without smiling once. The ensemble cast performances are all flawless, though the writing flags with one character, a playboy boyfriend included mostly for comic effect. His sports car blasting of pop tunes driving to a funeral seems inauthentic rather than idiotic, and his predatory motions towards a teenage girl seems forced and plays out with no surprises whatsoever. It is a surprising one-note caricature in a gallery of rounded, identifiable and all too human characters. The film is peppered with painfully accurate moments, in particular a resplendent dinner scene where the tensions boil over spectacularly.

Yes, the actors are great, but the characters' they're portraying are very irritating and unpleasant to watch.I don't really know who is to blame here. Is it the director, or is the play itself. Except of mild pity towards Julian Nicholsons' character (Ivy) I didn't sympathize with anyone. They are just not worth it. So I didn't care much about their problems either.The most irritating thing for me was the way the family members communicated with each other. Mother and daughter constantly yelling at each other and cursing each other. In fact, most of the conversations were passed in such way. So the audience has got a 2 hours of disrespectful bunch of people screaming at each other. And that's not because they are expressing themselves that way (to underline something). That's because it's how those characters usually behave.",August - Osage County
128,Camoo,Great film thwarted by an awful score,8,12 February 2014,"It's disappointing to see a film unfold so perfectly, only to be derailed halfway by something incongruous in either the plot or tone. That is exactly what happened to August: Osage County, a film I am certain was written brilliantly, was acted perfectly, and was unfortunately undercut by an overly dramatic and melodramatic score. This film could easily have been the best film I'd seen this year had it allowed those dramatic scenes to unfold naturally, letting us observe them rather than being told what to feel through the music. Everyone to his own, but I felt that the music took me out of the film entirely for those moments and interrupted the flow of the movie. It made me cringe. During the ending with Meryl on the stairs, the score was so over the top - I felt that her character was not deserving of music at all. About the only musical decision I remember agreeing with was the music playing over the radio on the opening credits. It is my only critique of an otherwise great film.",August - Osage County
129,macpet49-1,"Liz, Where Are You?",7,15 November 2014,"This was a role crying for Elizabeth Taylor who could've exhumed her Martha character from 'Virginia Woolf' and spiced it up with some drug addiction and deeper strains of borderline personality. Streep as far as I'm concerned is always playing Streep. I'm constantly aware of her personality which bothers me. I think she overacts. She has done this for so long that she depends on her ability to mock and mime characters rather than get really into them. She'd have done well as an impersonator. She teeters constantly on the line between good acting and camp. Her portrayal of the main character in this film is probably going to be more in line with 'Mommie Dearest' than something like Leigh's 'Streetcar'. She never evokes sympathy or empathy. There were a few moments of reflection where another gesture or way of emoting could've brought her some empathy but you just get to enjoy seeing her suffer so much after all the pain and havoc she's wreaked. All the other characters are demolished. They let her steal the scenes. Julia is nothing but annoying as she very often can be--a bit whiny and always angry. She's so obviously trying desperately to snatch the film from Streep but it's all for naught. Streep, like Davis and Crawford, just overpowers and nobody can crawl near the tornado of overblown persona going on. They'd just get sucked in. I gave it 7 stars because it does on one hand show the dysfunction that exists behind those lovely house facades. Anyone who's had a rotten childhood can get this drama and it can be somewhat cathartic to observe as long as you aren't living it. But, it's not O'Neill or Miller.",August - Osage County
130,ligonlaw,"Family Shares Dark, Ugly History",7,1 January 2014,"A family, ensemble drama, ""August: Osage County"" allows a cast of A-list actors to strut their stuff. Meryl Streep plays a bitter, horrible woman - the matriarch of the Oklahoma Weston family. Her husband, played by Sam Sheppard, is an alcoholic poet trapped in a hateful marriage. He commits suicide early in the film. The remainder of the film is the family gathering which takes place at the homestead before and after the funeral.Raw aggression is released at the family dinner, mostly by the Weston girls and their mother. The part of Violet, the mother, is played with precision by a seething, evil Streep. She taunts, attacks and abuses her family with a nasty relish. Julia Robert plays the oldest daughter, Barbara, who is the only daughter with the courage to confront the abusive, vile mother. The family dynamics reminded me of the sadistic conversations in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" The depravity and viciousness are present. This film is a stew of human misery with excellent performances by everyone involved. There will surely be nominations and maybe an Oscar or two. This is not a feel good movie.",August - Osage County

Chris Cooper, Sam Shepherd, Ewan Mcgregor, Dermot Mulroney, Juliette Lewis, Julianne Nicholson, Abigail Breslin, Meryl Streep, Julia Roberts, and the very very underrated Misty Upham...those are just of the top of my head. With a cast like that who cares that the story is about a bunch of miserable and mean SOB's looking to hurt each other emotionally...i mean if it is well done some viewers i bet would be giddy with glee just at the thought of that done by a bunch of iconic actors.the play itself won a whole bunch of awards, but you can't compare that to a movie version with a perfect cast who are world famous...they really did justice to the script. Everybody in this movie was awesome so it was hard to pick out who was the best...but if i had to choose, i would probably say Meryl Streep and she did get an Oscar nomination for it. Second would have to be Julia Roberts in a rare but effective dramatic role. The thing is, there so many good moments in this film by everybody and the 2 hrs and change just flew by and i laughed and commiserated with all the characters in the movie.if you are into fine acting then give this mean SOB of a dysfunctional family a chance!",August - Osage County
132,caseymoviemania,Casey's Movie Mania: AUGUST: OSAGE COUNTY (2013),7,8 January 2014,"This profanity-filled family melodrama may have been stretched into overkill, but the powerhouse acting ensemble and some worthwhile moments are irresistible enough to watch for.WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?Based on the successful 2007 Broadway play by Tracy Letts, AUGUST: OSAGE COUNTY begins with Weston patriarch Beverly (Sam Shepard) hires a Native American housekeeper named Johanna (Misty Upham) just before he goes missing. Following the incident, eldest daughter Barbara (Julia Roberts) heads back home along with her estranged husband Bill (Ewan McGregor) and their rebellious 14-year-old daughter Jean (Abigail Breslin) to look after her cancer-stricken mother Violet (Meryl Streep). Arriving home as well is middle daughter Ivy (Julianne Nicholson), Violet's sister Mattie Fae (Margo Martindale) and brother-in-law, Charlie (Chris Cooper), youngest daughter Karen (Juliette Lewis) and her handsome beau Steve (Dermot Mulroney), and finally, Charlie's quiet son, Little Charles (Benedict Cumberbatch). Then something happens: Beverly is found dead of an apparent suicide. Soon the Weston clan begins to reveal long-buried family secrets that goes nowhere but downhill.THE GOOD STUFFJohn Wells' direction is fairly efficient, while Tracy Letts' own adapted screenplay is reasonably sharp with snappy dialogue all around. No doubt he knows how to play around with words.Acting-wise, this is where the movie shines the most: Meryl Streep, as usual, gives an excellent performance as Violet. The way she acts all angry and crazy due to her excessive medication is riveting to watch for. Speaking of riveting, Julia Roberts gives one of her finest dramatic performances since ERIN BROCKOVICH (2000) and CLOSER (2004). Here, she is simply electric and even more so when she engages in verbal abuses against Meryl Streep during some of the movie's key moments. The rest of the cast is equally captivating, with special mention goes to Julianne Nicholson's breakthrough performance as the quietly affecting Ivy.MOST MEMORABLE MOMENT(S)The heated family dinner scene which ends up Barbara loses her temper and strangles her mother, Violet. The other memorable scene is of course, the ""eat your fish"" moment between Barbara, Violet and Ivy. Here's that particular clip below for your ""enjoyment"":MOST MEMORABLE QUOTE(S)Barbara: I'm running things now!Barbara: Eat your fish, b***h.THE BAD STUFFSome of the scenes are unnecessarily over-the-top, at which a little restraint would have been appreciated.FINAL WORDSIt's far from great, but if there's one movie you love to see top-notch actors insulting and screaming against each other, you can't go wrong with AUGUST: OSAGE COUNTY.http://www.caseymoviemania.blogspot.com",August - Osage County

Now of course opinion is infinite and everyone is a critic as they say. But when someone on the TV is sticking the knife in this film then quite frankly he should no longer be getting paid to review films. The film wasn't full of shouting and screaming; yes there where several outbursts as hidden truths where laid on the table, or when secrets rose to the surface, but what family wouldn't react that way? If a lifetime lie had been revealed what family wouldn't try to voice their opinion over other voices who are raising theirs? It is a film full of great acting; Meryl Streep was magnificent as the prescription drug fueled, vindictive Violet. Julia Roberts done well as Barbara, i enjoyed Chris Cooper as Charlie; everyone was great. There was emotion, humor, aggression, passion. Yes, it did have some downfalls, it became boring and awkward, but at the end of the film you are left feeling fulfilled, unless you are the aforementioned critic who spouts nonsense on a weekly basis.

134,s_campanale,High Camp on the Low Plains - Players play it up in film based play that plays like a play.,6,11 February 2014,"This film is based on a play. It is glaringly obvious because despite the opening up via film, the dialogue and narrative development are 100% theatrical, and what works in theatre rarely works on film and vice- versa. Evidence of this is found in many films pre 1960 when theatre still dominated as the 'true art' and most successful plays became films: These movies today strike us immediately with their artificiality and staginess and are hard to watch straight – Ditto this film. There are two criteria to judge this by, the source material and the adaptation. The direction by John Wells is excellent and the starry cast give it their all, and it works well in that respect. Alas it can never surpass its source material, the hugely successful play by Tracy Letts (who adapted it for the screen).The piece, though recent, plays out like some dinosaur from the 1940s or 50s, a Tennessee Williams fan fiction that apparently has nothing actually very penetrating or incisive to say about anything, least of all the nature of family relations. To its credit it presents very flawed characters and does not judge their behaviour (something good drama should always do) but the problem is that it means nothing because none of them are human beings. They are all caricatures, stock archetypes from 'the playwrights handbook 1952' such as 'acidic matriarch at war with daughters' 'noble poet' 'kind hearted simpleton' 'middle aged teenager who cannot grow up' 'edgy rebellious teenager' 'desperate intellectual' 'silent observing servant' etc. Not only are they completely artificial but so is their dialogue, which smacks of 'stage brilliance' but which is not how human beings communicate. The situations and the 'big scenes' are also contrived and unreal, and they feel just like scenes in a play and never as potential moments in the lives of these created people. The themes are also pretty shop-worn and passé as well. Prepare to meet such old favourites as 'long buried dark family secrets that come spilling out all at once at convenient get together' ' The talented writer's child who abandoned their potential to start a family much to famous parent's chagrin' 'the mentally deficient son as punishment for sin' 'evil as a heredity of blood' (aka the discredited genetic determinism chestnut) 'family dinner where everybody insults each other in bon mots until people are fighting on the floor' 'separated couple try to reach accord but can only trade more bon mots' 'saintly dead characters saintliness suddenly questioned by dark revelation' 'Siblings that are neatly divided up into individual single characteristics and are shocked and surprised by things they surely must have been aware of after all this time' 'Poignant stories from the past suddenly told at length in utterly inopportune moments before unquestioning other characters' 'authors favourite film clumsily name checked in absurd fashion by modern teenager' and many, many more! The acting is of course fantastic, but since they are all great actors and they are what is selling this entire picture then that must be a given and not a positive. Again, these are theatrical characters and stock ones too, so rather than show us their humanity or inner feelings they just show off. This is one big acting rap battle and nothing more.The talented stars 'facing off' include Meryl Steep as the hateful drug addicted wicked matriarch that would have been utterly abandoned or murdered years ago, Julia Roberts as self-righteous eldest daughter and mirror image of mother without realising it, Ewan Macgregor as weedy bespectacled intellectual who once strayed with a student, Abigail Breslin as rebellious teenage daughter who is rebellious and teenage, Sam Shepard as noble saintly drunken poet, Chris Cooper as henpecked noble man of the earth, Margo Martindale as wacky aunt who constantly chides son for no reason, Juliette Lewis as dumb slutty airhead (atypical casting for her) Dermot Mulroney as middle aged yuppie desperately trying to hang onto youth, Julianne Nicholson as daughter left behind to look after folks that finally is going to go her own way until something happens to stop her in tragic final act revelation, Misty Upham as native American servant girl with heart of gold and Benedict Cumberbatch as 'Simple Jack'.Awarded Tony's and Pulitzer's as a play (where it probably worked better, though not by much) and now Oscars and other awards as a film, this is the perfect confection of theatrical artifice, a piece that presumes to be about people but is in fact about theatrical contrivance.Still, there are worse films and as an actor's showcase alone (which to be fair it is..) it is entertaining as well as handy lesson for any budding playwrights on how NOT to write a convincing human tragedy!",August - Osage County
135,Tanay_LKO,Dysfunction and Devastation - a Dark-comedy Delivered,8,26 February 2014,"""August: Osage County"" belongs to the rather grim, often-shocking and perplexing genre of black-comedy. Such films are hilarious during its play, entertaining too in the drama but one thing that a viewer – experienced or rookie – cannot deny that they have this excruciating capability of ruining the mood and the zest for life, may lead to mild depression and even give suicidal thoughts to some extreme cases. Nevertheless, when such films are produced in a careful and sincere manner that when on a more meticulous observation they help a viewer understand the depth and the severity of the paradigms of rock-bottom and that, it could be as devastating as it gets but it also means that the same could become a solid foundation to something real progressive and better – like ""reconstruction from demolition"". As goes the opening line of the film – ""Life is very long"". So, it could be very demoralizing but we may, by the end, make some room for hope as well.The film is a fine example of a well-written production, and no surprise at that because it's the adaptation of a Pulitzer-prize winning play of the same name. Tracy Letts wrote the characters of the members of a dysfunctional extended countryside-American family so dynamic that they seemed real, even with their unreal egotisms, anxieties and the seriously botched up consequences of the major decisions of their lives that become the very reasons of them unable to stand each other even in the sombre moments of crisis of the patriarch's death and thus, end up dissolving un-amicably. The other engaging aspect of the film is it's casting, with an ensemble of Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts with Ewan McGregor, Chris Cooper, Abigail Breslin, Juliette Lewis, Dermot Mulroney, Julianne Nicholson and Benedict Cumberbatch (who is famous for ""Sherlock"", and plays a timid-underachieving and clumsy first-cousin). Streep(the extraordinary) and Roberts played their characters to the point where you stop feeling disgust for them and start loathing their reasoning and the very guts. No surprise that they got nominated for the Academy Awards for the Best Actress and Supporting Actress.The film comprises of several feeble moments as well, especially during the mid-part where concentration is more on the insanity (""mild cognitive impairment/brain damage"") of the matriarch due to her drug problem and the side effects of the treatment of her oral-cancer; but due to the compactness of the screenplay it doesn't cause any loss of interest. Also, the direction (by John Wells) keeps shifting its attention on all characters in order to give a more profound view of the ""variety of the anxiety"". Another supporting feature of the film is it's editing (by Stephen Mirione) and the music (by Gustavo Santaolalla) that enhances the claustrophobia of the guilt and the anxiety in a very smooth and rather easy-going manner; even make it pleasant up to a great extent.Not a recommended watch to those who like easy-going romantic-comedies and character-oriented films without a fictional-inclination, but to be very honest – it's worth a try; as quoted Sir William Shakespeare – ""All these woes shall serve, for sweet discourses in our time to come.""",August - Osage County

I liked how it felt very much like a play, and it had strong performances by everyone involved. I must say that the poster and trailer were misleading but showing the movie as a comedy.

Whoever wrote the scripts obviously realized the weakness in the story and chose to keep the story moving by adding one surprise twist after another. The storyline twists aren't carefully crafted by any means. They are simplistic, absurd revelations about each family member, each one out-doing the last in depravity. The audience was mostly senior citizens and most seemed offended by the gratuitous swearing (another reflection of a poor writer). Many in the audience fell asleep and about 20% left the theater after about an hour. This is obviously Oscar bait, patched together by the producers but I can't imagine this waste of time gets any recognition from any credible organization.

What was the point of the film? The ending was rubbish and people got irate over nothing or perhaps to ensure there would be enough scenes for the trailer and the movie poster.Every scene felt disconnected and I think the only good thing this film had going for it was Julia Roberts who is a total pro.

139,stephenlovelette,Insufferable Melodrama,4,30 June 2014,"Well folks, I'm not sure what to do.It's funny how much I feel inclined to dilute my true feelings in this review.August: Osage County's insufferable.I watch movies for three reasons. 1) To enjoy a story 2) To learn or, 3) To be moved by compelling characters in complex situations. AOC accomplishes none of these goals.The entire film is one melodramatic argument after another. The dialogue is painfully theatrical throughout.On a basic level, it's a dramatic character study.The opening scene is mildly compelling, but everything falls flat after that.Meryl's performance is okay. That's the most I'll give her on this one. I know I'm supposed to say she's wonderful, but that wouldn't be the truth. I never once pitied nor cared for her character, and am bored and irritated every time she speaks.Which is why I believe this must be more appealing to women.During an early conversation, in between a smattering of selfishly sad comments, Meryl tells her daughter, ""You look like a lesbian,"" because of her new haircut. She's sneaking pills (in a cutesy manner) behind the daughter's back, and in reference to someone she says, ""Oh, he smokes a lotta grass,"" with a knowing grin.Is this stuff supposed to be funny? Or edgy? It's not, and dull as all get out.Oh and the pills clacking against her teeth, the gulping noises and the heavy exhalations that follow, all I can think is, ""Christ when will this woman shut up?""I digress to emphasize this point. The amount of audible lip smacking, cigarette sipping, tongue clacking, gasping, scoffing, gulping, pill clattering, throat clearing, harrumphing and sighing that comes from Meryl is abominable. I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking with all the mouth noises, but it's unbearable.When something is said outside of an argument, the conversations are so articulate; the character interactions unfold like a novel. And it's cringeworthy.For example. Early on, Julia and Ewan are driving out to Meryl's, Roberts says (and I'm paraphrasing), ""Ah, the Midwest. It's more like a state of mind, a spiritual affliction, like the blues..."" This is hokey, over the top, and overwrought with emotion and nostalgia. People don't talk like this.When they arrive at the house, their daughter, Abigail Breslin announces, ""I'm gonna grab a smoke."" Julia turns to Ewan and says, ""She gets that from you."" Okay, her character's fourteen years old and this has been done so many times it makes me sick. It's just typical melodramatic bullshit.Later on, Ewan and Julia have a screaming match while retrieving chairs from a storage shed. It reeks of choreographed cliché.Here are the sole redeeming qualities of the film.Julia Roberts is the cream of the crop in terms of likability and acting performance here. So is Benedict Cumberbatch, Ewan McGregor (albeit quite soapy), Chris Cooper, Julianne Nicholson and Dermot Mulroney (despite the ridiculous character he portrays).The catfish scene's great. Any scene where Julia drops an F-bomb is decent enough. J.R. should audition for the next female superhero. She's badass in this.The interaction between Abigail Breslin and Dermot Mulroney is just nonsensical and so painful.So he blasts Livin' La Vida Loca with strangers in his red convertible rental, passes other vehicles in an obnoxious fashion, he's been married three times, answers his phone during the recitation of Grace at a funeral dinner, plays fast and loose about his heavy pot smoking, AND likes fourteen year old girls?Wow. Never saw that coming.In retrospect, I think we're supposed to like Cooper's character, but he humiliates Breslin over her personal beliefs. Wasn't he the one lecturing about meanness?What is going on with the long-winded southern-twanged monologues from old women about hardships from their youth? I think they're sitting at that dinner table for almost a half hour.Where did the romantic notions develop about the Southern twang? It gets extremely tiresome early on.The momentary violence that follows the dinner scene provides the only thrill.Holy Hell, why would I ever want to watch this?It's as if between arguments, each character is thinking about the nuances of their individual relationships. As if they're chambering poignant, articulate arguments in self-defense.We get it: Each character is wildly different from the rest, struggling with their own dark and complex conflicts. But why would I ever care about these horrific people? I bought in as much as I could.I'm sure this is a very good play, but as a film it comes off like a soap opera and a colossal waste of my time.Although it weaves an intricate and confusing narrative, the cast of characters is too large to keep you familiar with their various complexities in between recitations of Meryl Streep's monologues.I hate her character. I really mean that. That's not a character I care anything about.I never care for anyone's plight though, and never come close to crying. Perhaps a ping of emotion when Roberts realizes Ewan's not coming back.It's all very dark, and the conflicts add up to compelling motivations, but I don't care. I'm watching too much melodrama, high-horsing and sadness.As usual, I'm less upset about being duped into paying for a dull film, than the absurd idea this would be nominated Best Motion Picture.I guess there's an audience out there for this type of movie, but it's not me or anybody with similar tastes.I dislike August: Osage County and wouldn't recommend it.While it's not devoid of intelligent content, it's a drab and dreary picture that's ultimately, rather unfulfilling.",August - Osage County

I also very much liked Julia Roberts in this movie who was nominated for best supporting actress Oscar. Roberts' role in August-Osage County has far more depth and range to it and is far more deserving of an Oscar than her role in Erin Brockovich.

They are both great but not in this one I am afraid.If one actor should be nominated for an award from this film that was Julianne Nicholson (Ivy).Apart from awards and nominations, this was a movie with a weak and cliché story and a melodramatic and loud directing.I also think the super duper cast didn't work in favor of the movie. The whole thing came out forced.

144,miss_lady_ice-853-608700,Death of The Weston World,8,15 March 2014,"August: Osage County is the stuff of Classic American Drama- a coming together of a dysfunctional family breaking apart, acting as a metaphor for America itself. The metaphorical aspects come through more strongly in the play that this film is an adaptation of but as a Tennessee Williams type of melodrama, it works a treat.Patriach of the Weston family (presumably a play on 'Western') Beverly (Sam Shepard, whose plays are not dissimilar to this one) goes missing. Bit by bit the Weston family gather together: eldest Barbara (Julia Roberts), whose husband Bill (Ewan McGregor) has a taste for the younger woman (i.e. his students); middle daughter Ivy (Julianne Nicholson) who seems weak but has more than a few secrets and youngest daughter Karen (Juliette Lewis) and her good-for-nothing fiancé Steve (Dermot Mulroney). These are Violet's (Meryl Streep) children; Violet spews vitriolic abuse at everyone and pops pills to numb the pain of her ironic mouth cancer. Oh, and there's Barbara and Bill's son, precocious Jean (Abigail Breslin), Violet's motherly sister Mattie Fae (Margo Martendale), her husband Charlie (Chris Cooper) and their slow-witted son Little Charles (Benedict Cumberbatch). Oh, and Violet's maid, Native American Joanna (Misty Upham). But that's it for the cast- promise.So as you can see, there's a lot of characters and stories to get your head around but I'm a sucker for a big old family brawl. The attitude cinema has towards theatre is to get a load of big name actors, throw them together in a view and watch them tear each other apart. Luckily it works, as each actor gives a great performance. Streep manages to make her character slightly more than a grotesque and Roberts does a good job as the strong-willed eldest daughter, but I actually enjoyed the secondary performances a bit more- in particular Cumberbatch, who plays completely against type to great effect, and Nicholsen. They are the innocents of the piece, although they won't escape punishment. Reviewers say that Cumberbatch was miscast; he was odd casting certainly but I think it works. The whole point is that Little Charles doesn't fit into the family; he's barely acknowledged. This is the crux of his character, that he isn't accepted in the way that the other family members are.I think Dermot Mulroney is a bit miscast as the sleazy Steve; he is in the same predicament as Ewan McGregor. They don't do a bad job of it but it could be any actor playing the role. Perhaps this is because they don't get enough screen time. Actually, McGregor is kind of like how I imagined Bill reading the play but I think Mulroney is too good-looking. He doesn't really look like your average fifty-year-old and it takes away some of the power of his 'big' scene, which is sanitised anyway. Breslin is believable as precocious teen Jean; a minor character but an important one, as it forces Barbara to compare herself to her mother. At what generation will this dysfunction breed out? This is why I enjoyed the film so much; it shows how family wounds last through different generations. Luckily Ivy and Karen are childless and Barbara has only one daughter, suggesting that they can at least avoid some of this pain, but still, there are fresh wounds opened that won't die for another few generations yet.There isn't a plot as such; it's more about the disintegration of the family and their secrets. The play is a bit of an epic in the style of Eugene O'Neill,about three hours long. The film comes in at 130 minutes. The effect of the drastic cut is that there is so much story, which is good because it's entertaining but it also makes things seem rushed and it could be confusing for those who don't know the play. To be fair, it's quite a while since I read the play but I recall Bill, Steve and Joanna having much more of a presence. Some plot threads aren't given a lot of room yet they are linked into the story so can't be neatly removed. If this play and film had been made in the fifties, it would have been a prestige picture and would have been allowed its long running time but unfortunately only tedious action/fantasy films are allowed to be almost three hours. We are no longer interested in human emotions and drama apparently.The dialogue zings, which is one of the reasons why filmmakers bother adapting plays. Tracy Letts' screenplay, based (quite accurately) on his play is vitriolic and violent but also terribly funny. Characters are bitchy and bitter but not without reason. Also, there are some great twists and shock-horror moments, leading people in the cinema to gasp audibly, as if they were watching at home! Ultimately, I think the film is strong and well-acted. It loses a little in its translation to film but not as much as you would think, and it serves as a reminder of the brilliant source play.",August - Osage County
145,MovieDude1893,Cast and script overcome studio softening,7,12 January 2014,"August: Osage County (Wells, 2013, B) An absolute clinic in terms of a studio not understanding the property from which they've decided to make a movie. The tacked on final moments and the downright bizarre closing credits aren't enough to poison the rest, though. But, I feel like those unfamiliar with the source material will be left with a fundamental confusion about what they just saw.The rest, however, is good, compelling drama. It's an outstanding play that's visualized without any particular imagination or energy. The geography if the house is clearly laid out, but never really develops into a tonal force of the film. The heavy lifting here is done by the cast and the wonderful script. Letts is wise to retain most of the play's best lines and the dinner scene centerpiece is an absolute marvel of ensemble acting. Streep has come under fire for her supposed scenery-chewing in the role of Violet. Those criticisms, however, seem to misunderstand the role itself, or at least the purpose of the role as it pertains to the lives of the other characters. She is a wild, vitriolic, malignant force to be reckoned with. Streep plays it with aplomb and a notable current of humanity. Roberts is impressive as well, often incorporating subtle echoes of Streep's performance into her own. Nicholson does very well in one of the more subtly difficult roles. Martindale and Cooper are also both outstanding, but these roles are both firmly within their comfort zones and by now their excellence is a forgone conclusion.Much of the film retains the affecting nature of the play. Yet, too much of it is hindered by intrusion or softening for it to be the play's equal.",August - Osage County
146,kira02bit,Another Southern fried disaster about a dysfunctional family,4,7 December 2014,"Through the ages of cinema, Hollywood has had a rather misguided fascination that overpraised stage plays set in the South and focusing on manic dysfunctional Southern families must be brought to the screen and big name stars need to fall over themselves to get roles in them because it offers them a chance to try their hand at Southern accents and ""meaty"" dramatics. August: Osage County is the latest dismal effort to follow this trend.Based on the long-running, long-winded and wildly overpraised stage play by Tracy Letts (who regrettably provides the screenplay as well), the film focuses on a disastrous family reunion that occurs when scattered poet and patriarch Sam Shepard commits suicide and his extended family and progeny gather to provide emotional support to his venomous, cancer-stricken wife Meryl Streep. The inhabitants of the house include: three daughters Julia Roberts, Julianne Nicholson and Juliette Lewis; Roberts' estranged husband Ewan McGregor and surly teenage daughter Abigail Breslin; Lewis' shady fiancé Dermot Mulroney; Streep's busybody sister Margo Martindale, her tolerant husband Chris Cooper and their simple-minded son Benedict Cumberbatch; and Streep's Native American caregiver Misty Upham.It goes without saying that there will be screaming, breakdowns and ridiculously contrived circumstances that will allow select members of the cast to chomp the scenery. The story leaves no hoary old cliché unplumbed - we get drug addiction, suicide, infidelity, alcoholism, neglect, attempted pedophilia, and even potential incest. Oh those crazy Southern families! Meanwhile, everyone relentlessly complains about the heat without ever explaining why no one turns on the air conditioner in the house.Nearly without exception, the men are all depicted and portrayed as spineless wimps at the mercy of the harridan women triumphantly ruining their lives. The acting is all over the map.Streep throws herself fully into the lead role of the nasty matriarch, but one wonders why. Once or twice, she tells a remembrance (which may well be a lie since everything from her is suspect) which starts to elicit sympathy, but then she returns to form. Streep's Violet is an atrociously nasty piece of work, who tyrannizes her children, may well have driven her husband to suicide (you'll wish you had joined him after a while), and relishes any opportunity for a vicious verbal or physical assault on her family - with her eyes constantly scanning the room for any imagined weakness that she can assail. It is hard to understand what attracted an actress of Streep's stature to this one-note part, unless she had reached a stage where she just wanted to indulge in some over-acting. Roberts is actually quite good in a more measured performance. She has acted fairly infrequently over the last decade and her work here reminded me of why I once was impressed with her. Lewis trots out her tired Southern white trash/ditzy doormat schtick for the hundredth time. Is it just me, or are both Martindale and Mulroney giving the same performance in everything now? McGregor has a distinctly thankless role as Roberts' weak husband - he has now made the journey from edgy films to mainstream to blah Oscar fodder.What is ironic is that some of the actors in the less showy roles actually make a better lasting impression. Nicholson manages some touching moments. Upham brings a serene dignity that is otherwise missing from the film. Cumberbatch loses himself in the part of the simple-minded nice guy constantly abused by his mother, and the sequence between he and Nicholson at the piano is one of the film's two highlights. The second being Cooper mothballing his taciturn nature to unleash his rage on Martindale for the abuse directed at their son.By the end of the film, everything has run on far too long, too many have been too unlikable and mean-spirited to care about, and we are exhausted from the ordeal - and not in a good way. The screenplay contrives a preposterous structure whereby a certain dramatic subplot reaches its climax and one of the main participants flees the house in a torrent of emotion - be it anger or despair. This same tired device is repeated until only two characters remain in the house. The whole thing ends up coming across as a heavy, overacted exercise in melodrama and bathos, and provides the best evidence of why these Southern-fried stage atrocities should be put out to pasture instead of shepherded to the big screen with fanfare",August - Osage County

We are born innocent but as we grow we take on the imperfections and idiocentricities of the people that surround us and sometimes it's good but, sometimes it's creates horror.This movie shows you how other generations can be impacted by how our parents or grandparents teach us cruel or unusual behavior.

Meryl as the mother is awesome - convincing and utterly nasty with good reason so it turns out. Benedict Cumberbatch is not convincing as the simpering weak cousin everyone else is wonderful. I was hooked from the moment it started.It is like going to one of those terrible funerals where the dead person is suddenly a saint and no-one wants to talk about anything bad but you know it is there. My parents generation has seen quite a few of those lately where the patriarch of the family who was a thief or control freak is suddenly the much loved amazing human.

150,Skylightmovies,A hate watch with rewards,5,18 June 2020,"Once again, the audience's suspension of reality, that this combination of humans could possibly exist, is taken for granted by a lazy casting employee.
But they do.
Narcissism in matriarchal families is rife these days.
Having chased their men away with entitled histrionics and projected humiliation, the lead chick rules the roost with a fist, bubble wrapped in victimhood, yet able to wound their flying monkeys with their knife jabs of abuse and mental torture.
The men are weakened trying to fill the void of bitterness in the shell of these birth givers, and are played with suitable dignity by a stellar selection.
We have to accept that these guys, who could get a girl a the drop of hat, have settled for the pickings that are bruised and rotten to the core.
Except Julianne Nicholson, who seems like a real woman, sensitive, caring, tolerant and hopeful. We root for her for most of this story, as the other females are determined to be angry and miserable and to ensure everyone around them is aware of their unfixable plight.
Thing is about narcissism, there can only be one guy at the top and one guy at the bottom, there will always be a scapegoat and Mother Meryl can't make her mind up who to manipulate into that role. She publicly sympathises with another's sorrow but the tale is used to draw eyes to her suffering as she narrates. Classic overt narcissism.
In this shared Streep vehicle, we have the butch Roberts and the girly Cumberpatch, amongst a Harry Potter like invitee casting call.
Juliette Lewis does well playing the desperately covert narcissist, permanently gaslighting her fragile self into happiness and Ewan does what he can with his four or five lines while donning ugly making specs. The specs don't work and one feels quite vindicated when it is revealed that he had a fling with a youngster in an attempt to mentally breakaway from the forever grim Roberts.Breslin's quality acting days might be now numbered but the plethora of perverted storylines await those one size fits all performers are plattered up on Netflix for her I expect.Do we learn anything from this tale of matriarchal narcissism?By the end we are glad of the various departures and hope it will be permanent. The lead narcissist is left alone with her maid and the fallout from her behaviour is excused with her illness.......as usual.So yes, we learn that these vampires always find a new supply and their discard of the victim, worse for their children, will eventually traumatise them, that the only foreseeable cure is to return.The cycle ends when the narcissist is left alone and the wounded learn to rely on themselves and accept the damage done and irretrievable years.There is a lot of nonsense in this cat fest but the take away is there after two hours or so.Men need better teachers and role models.Women cannot do this alone, they are never happy with the results",August - Osage County

It tells the story of the Weston family and the aftermath of their father's suicide. Meryl Streep is very good in her completely unlikeable character of Violet Weston who emotionally abuses her own family. Julia Roberts is also very good as daughter Barbara alongside Dermot Mulroney who plays the potential new brother in law and is surprise surprise a real jerk. There are some great actors in smaller roles such as Misty Upham as the family's cook. It has all of the right ingredients but I was disappointed. Nothing goes right for this family and it is draining watching their life fall apart. Nothing is resolved either. Don't get me wrong, I don't regret seeing it but I probably won't remember it either. There are better films around at the moment.",August - Osage County
152,lampic,What a cast,10,31 July 2015,"Meryl Streep is a matriarch from Hell who drives her gentle, soft-spoken poet husband (Sam Shepard) into suicide and in the aftermath of his funeral the family is assembled around the family table, where all the Hell breaks loose. In a heart-wrenching sequence after sequence we follow as parental cruelty creates more unhappiness and cruelty in a vicious circle that never ends and only continues to grow like cancer in Streep's character mouth. Just like Violet (Meryl Streep) herself once suffered at the hands of her own mother, now she is the one who tortures everybody around her and her nastiness spreads around like some infectious disease , affecting not only the youngest, third generation but even innocent bystanders. Even when Violet doesn't spit insults from her cancerous mouth, just her presence and Medusa-look is enough to affect everybody present. Just as she probably emotionally blackmailed her late husband to the point he could not take it anymore, Violet now manipulates and pulls the strings above her three daughters and its fascinating to watch energy between them. There is the strongest Barbara who has all the predispositions to became her mother (Julia Roberts), soft and self sacrificing old maid Ivy (Julianne Nicholson) and a family bimbo (Juliette Lewis) who is basically constantly overlooked,hushed or screamed at. The rest of the family - aunts, husbands, boyfriends and children - are not just a background but all deeply involved with their own dramas. At the end the only single person who has not had meltdown is quiet, recently employed Native Indian (Misty Upham) stunned in her shock of what is going on around her. As expected, Meryl Streep is nothing less than brilliant, though in this role she comes very close to latter-day Bette Davis. We watch her in horror as she gleefully throws arrows around her in painkillers-induced drug stupor, just to watch even bigger horror her sudden look that wordlessly express she knew everything all along and not a single family secret has ever escaped her. The most fascinating thing about this movie is how it suggests that Meryl Streep is passing her crown to (gasp) Julia Roberts who more than holds her own, in fact Roberts shows such a huge range of emotions here that it caught me completely by surprise - never in a million years I suspected she has it in her and years (nah, decades) in blockbusters behind her only bored me so far.

Other than those and a few others its just fine. There is so much utter film garbage in the theaters today (they all resemble landfills) so even this mediocre bit of dysfunctional trash starts to look good.

154,jmoney-2,This movie will help you appreciate your family,4,14 January 2014,"Most of us probably spent time with members of our extended family over the holidays. For some, that time likely included some awkward moments. But it's a safe bet no one's family gatherings were as awful as the one depicted in the new film August: Osage County.The movie is based on the Pulitzer Prize winning play by Tracy Letts (who plays Sen. Lockhart on Showtime's Homeland), and it tells the story of the Weston clan, who come together after their alcoholic patriarch (played by Sam Shepard) commits suicide. The matriarch, Violet (Meryl Streep) is an intensely mean-spirited, cancer plagued drug addict. Violet's three adult daughters all have issues of their own. This is one dysfunctional bunch.The original stage production is regarded as a dark comedy. But if the movie version is supposed to be funny, it seems no one bothered to tell the actors. They all seem to be playing the scenes with a deadly a serious tone, and rightfully so. The movie depicts some serious issues: cancer, drug addiction, suicide, divorce, incest and corruption of a minor. There's no dark comedy here, just plain darkness. (I haven't seen the play, but its author, Mr. Letts, also wrote the screenplay. So, I'm guessing it's rather faithful.) Streep is (it almost goes without saying) phenomenal. Her performance is powerful and devastating. Julia Roberts, who plays eldest daughter Barbara, is also commanding, though her character is anything but charming. If you've always longed to see America's Sweetheart act somber and bitter for two hours, this is the movie for you. Her trademark smile is nowhere in sight. Julianne Nicholson (Boardwalk Empire) displays a poignant determination as another sister, Ivy, who strives for happiness despite some pretty insurmountable obstacles. Their performances are so good, it's almost hard to believe the movie is so unsatisfying. Never have I seen such good acting in the service of a story so unappealing.While most of the cast is stellar, there are two notable exceptions: UK stars Ewan McGregor and Benedict Cumberbatch both struggle with their American accents. While I truly admire the previous work of both men, I had to wonder, with all the out of work thespians in this country, couldn't the producers find two American actors who were talented enough to play the roles? (Are we running dangerously low on Baldwin brothers?) Cumberbatch, in particular, surely isn't hurting for employment. It seemed like he was in every other movie released in 2013.I haven't talked much about the plot. That's because there isn't much of one. There's no goal or objective for the characters to achieve, no central question (i.e. will there be a happy ending?) that keeps us interested until it's answered in the movie's climax. Yes, Barbara takes steps to confront Violet's drug addiction. And yes, some characters have secrets that are revealed along the way. But none of these moments coalesce into anything resembling a story with a beginning, middle and an end. Essentially, this movie is just a bunch of cruel, unhappy people shouting at each other for two hours. They're trapped together in a house and the audience is trapped along with them.There are interesting themes beneath the surface: overcoming the troubled circumstances of your upbringing and how a child's love for their parent can endure despite constant abuse. But the themes are never developed into a message or a conclusion. All of this must've worked on the stage. After all, they don't just hand out Pulitzers. But it doesn't work as a movie.",August - Osage County

I know it's too early in the Oscar race to predict but these two women give a powerhouse performance that deserves recognition. A wonderful cast has been put together to display how a dysfunctional family has been brought back together by tragedy and how Violet (Streep) treats her daughters after they've been gone for a long time.

In order to accurately review this film, it may be necessary to talk about some key moments.--August: Osage County IS a good movie; that's about all I can say good about it however, as it is also perhaps one of the most frustrating movies I've seen since the 90s adaptation of ""The Crucible"". For anyone who isn't a Meryl Streep fan, understand that this is her movie, as it's basically a showcase for her to go crazy with a character and have everyone else play off said craziness. I'm not a big Meryl Streep fan, which perhaps added to my difficulties in watching this film, but I feel the focus of this review should be elsewhere since there is ample room for improvement all around.First off, the film starts off by introducing us to the husband of Streep's character whom shortly thereafter commits suicide. It becomes very quickly evident just why he did so, which begs the question ""what am I doing watching this movie?"". I couldn't figure out if I was supposed to feel sorry for this family in turmoil, or if I was just suppose to passively watch them poorly handle each other's company during a time of morning. It seemed by the end that it was just that: a brief but pivotal moment in the lives of a severely dysfunctional family, which leads me to problem #2 with the film: there was too much dysfunction. Pump the breaks, the drama wouldn't end. Anyone blood related to Streeps character in this film was either just as crazy or simply a product of severe misfortune as bad events and bad news relentlessly piled up against them. Everyone married into it just looked like they themselves were either super removed and oblivious to the drama or going to head down Streep's husband's path themselves one day, all except Ewan McGregor's character. It's a very frustrating watch.Which makes it all the more amazing that it's not a bad movie. It IS a good film. It's not great because all potential's squandered away as it becomes clear about halfway through the film that it's impossible for any light to be shed on these lives by the end. You feel helpless and if you can somehow manage to relate to it, it will most likely make you feel a ton better about your family. Being based on a play I can only imagine how a story like this would be having real people act it out in front of you. It isn't all that fun to watch, but surely it was fun to act, which is most likely the biggest purpose it served (and yes the acting is top notch). If the story was tuned down a bit to less severe subject matter, or not try and be so dark it most likely would've felt more real and less like an insane social commentary on misfortune that somehow could all occur in just one family gathering. It's a hard one to recommend, and I would only do so if someone felt that they absolutely needed to see it, which means in most cases I cannot recommend this movie.",August - Osage County
158,akkoziol,Amazing acting and amazing story,10,31 March 2014,"I had the great pleasure of seeing Tracy Letts many a time in the nighties when he was still a nobody in a very loose group of improv comedy guys called Bang Bang Spontaneous Theatre here in Chicago. The same place/group Michael Shanon came from by the way. I was briefly a member myself. You could see even back then that there was something very special about him. As for the movie? Loved it, loved it, loved it! It made me have such hatred and contempt for Meryl Streep's character and the way she treats all those around her that I found myself cursing at the screen. That, my friends, is indicative of great acting and great storytelling. I was fully invested in hating her character so much right from the get go. That is until the story progressed further.It takes you, the viewer, a while to get background on all the sisters in the movie as well as the mother but as things unfold you gradually wind up having *some* empathy, and even pity, for why they are they way they are. It isn't until the final 1/4 of the movie that we come to see how absolutely broken all these sisters are and we come to realize it's not their fault.This movie is a complete example of how patterns of behavior in how we are raised and in what we consider is our ""normal"" can have such damaging effects on who we become and how we raise our own children, form relationships and treat others around us later on in life. Things can continue circuitously unless we actively choose to break such patterns.There is no way Meryl Streep will not win an Oscar for this performance.

159,MacTheMovieguy,Definitely not a happy movie,8,23 July 2014,"Family. The core foundation at August Osage County. A very dysfunctional family. A matriarch who is at times a devil, and other times, in fleeting moments, a caring mother. But most of the time, she's a devil. August Osage County is based on the Tony award winning play of the same name, and it recently earned both Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts more Oscar nominations. The good news is that I felt both deserved it.Meryl Streep plays the head of the family brought back together after a family crisis. Her three daughters come back. Barbara (Roberts) is separated from her husband (McGregor), but brings him along too, as well as their cigarette smoking 14 year old daughter (Breslin). Ivy (Nicholson) is seen as the weakest of the trio, but she's secretly dating her cousin Charles (Cumberbatch). Karen (Lewis) brings her fiancé (Mulroney) back with her. Martindale and Cooper play Streep's sister and brother-in-law, respectively.Set in the desolate wasteland of Oklahoma, the film unspools much like the sanity in the family. People attack each other, secrets come out, and nobody is safe. Streep's pill-popping matriarch is easy to blame at first, but everyone is really responsible for their own mistakes. The brilliant cast soars above the script, making the most out of long rambling scenes. Specifically, Streep, Roberts, and Cooper stand out from the rest of the cast. Each one of them has their own ""big moment"" in the script. Martindale is good too.Some big reveals late in the film keep the film interesting until the end. It drags a big in spots, but it really holds pretty well for a ""talker"". Definitely not a happy movie. I have no idea why it was nominated for a Golden Globe in the comedy category. I didn't laugh once. This is a pretty clear cut drama. What a bizarre nomination.",August - Osage County

While the star power was there, I felt that Barbara, Julia Roberts'character, was the only truly developed character. Truth is, Barbara's storyline isn't all that unusual.

The film is shades of the play, a play that worked brilliantly on stage, and as a film could so easily have been left out of itself. By opening it up and getting in a stunning set of players Tracy Letts' great play has become an even greater film. There, I've said it. Southern Gothic but with a universal message for all families. It was grand guignol, but bubbling under us all is some of that. We keep the lid on things. We deceive and lie. We ignore things, and celebrate things. This hot dry look at the lives of strong-willed women, whose paths have diverged, revealed vast changes which have slowly prised them apart. At this family crisis, the death of a poet, a father, and a grandfather, brings them home for different reasons. On stage the set - at London's National Theatre - was two floors of a house, and it was a star in its way. On film, we could share the history of the particular house they used, and because this is a movie we can move in on detail and then open it out. But not too much.

August: Osage County won the 2008 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, because the dialogs between the characters manage to put everything, all the feelings on the table. You would think that a movie based on such a script already made itself, but in my opinion it needed much more. Yes, the dialogs are intense, very rich, but for me they we're weakly explored. As human beings in situation as those retreated, we do much more then simply talk and for me that lacked in the movie. Another thing that didn't got me was the end. I understand it might have work for the Pulitzer. I realize that as a story this could be a functional end. But for the movie, it didn't work. Mostly because the entire time we lacked the motion like I already mention so for me, as for many other viewers we're expecting the end to bring it on. But it didn't and that's why it felt disappointing. With the way the movie was conducted I guess they could have given us a little more that what they gave in the end, because certainly there could be more to it. But we have to respect what people behind the scene choose to do. We just don't have to like it and I didn't. It's a reasonable movie and like many other times it's the BRILLIANT Meryl Streep who makes the about two hours worth it. For anyone who as seen this lady on other performances, even just once, you are astonished with her ability to perform. Streep builds her characters with such an amazing detail that you don't see her or any of the other character she has played. You see what she wants you to see, in this case, it is Violet Western. Once again I'm amazed with her excellency and I have enjoyed the movie thanks to her. It's just beautiful to watch if you appreciate acting. For this last reason I advise it, but with caution, do not set your expectations to high.",August - Osage County

I quitted after half an hour...I mean, I got a headache because of all the screaming and...I don't know, I got creeped out. The cast is promising and they really do a great job despite the loss of a script. The people portraited are so unnaturally extreme. Why, oh why can't you produce movies of any good, anymore? It's so expensive to go to the theatres and I wanna get blown away, and not be screamed at and become unsettled. That's what my own life is for, thank you very much.I guess, I stick to Brits movies.

168,generationfilm,August: Osage County- John Wells' Sophomoric Direction Makes for a Durable and Fairly Poetic Adaptation of Tracy Letts' Play,8,10 November 2013,"The concepts of legacy and family tend to go hand in hand but that assumed positive link usually fails to recognize the potentially negative outcomes that can be handed down from generation to generation where dysfunction, bitterness, and judgment prevails over harmony, love, and understanding. This negative focus on the pure dysfunction that festers and spreads throughout the family roots much like a disease that damages the potential of fruitful growth is the deep focus in playwright Tracy Letts' play August: Osage County, which comes to the big screen through the literal and figurative sophomoric direction of John Wells (The Company Men). Being Wells' sophomore cinematic effort there are some deeply admirable qualities contained in his presentation of Letts' darkly humorous and dramatically impactful script but tends to often times drift away from perfectly balancing the two highly emotive extremes by also opening up the intentionally claustrophobic play. Adapting the written word of a play into the visual medium of cinema is an exceptionally hard endeavor and August: Osage County, while dramatically impressive in performance and not too much else, could be offered as a study on how plays often times are a preferable experience on the stage. However, John Wells' take on the family dysfunction revealed through unforgiving honesty, family secret twists, and melodramatic flair on equal scale as Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf is definitely an exhausting yet entertaining experience focused on deep character reflection, authentic performances, and acrobatic dialogue clashes. Compared to other Letts adaptations, the other two being Bug and Killer Joe both directed by William Friedkin and only the latter being superb, August: Osage County stands as a fairly strong cinematic addition to those attempts that relinquishes some of the play's more haunting claustrophobia for a visual openness and a relatively positive changed ending that doesn't necessarily work as intended. Letts' play brings to mind the haunting and poetic words of another writer Mitch Albom in his book ""The Five People You Meet in Heaven"" where he wrote, ""All parents damage their children. It cannot be helped. Youth, like pristine glass, absorbs the prints of its handlers. Some parents smudge, others crack, a few shatter childhoods completely into jagged little pieces, beyond repair."" August: Osage County demonstrates just how dark yet humorously familiar the raw and heartbreaking effects that damage the possible growth the family limbs encounter as they grow away from the equally damaged family tree and while Wells' film isn't pristine it certainly delivers a dramatically engaging experience.More on this review: http://wp.me/py8op-C2; More reviews: generationfilm.net",August - Osage County
169,kitchent,Sam Shepard was the lucky one.......,1,10 January 2014,"First let me give the positive things about this film:The direction was great, and the editing was fluid with scenes allowed to play themselves out instead of hacked up like chopped meat. There were no quick cuts to annoy the hell out of me, and this film was shot beautifully.The acting was first rate (as you can imagine with this cast), and I thought Julia Roberts especially was spot on. Meryl Streep got on my nerves, but I'm not sure it was her or the fact that her character was as hateful a character as you can imagine.Now the problems for me. By the 30 minute mark, I was over it. I could identify with no one in the film, nor did I care about any of the characters. At the 60 minute mark I was pretty sure that Sam Shepard was the smartest person in the film by drowning himself within the first 10 minutes. With envy I longed for the sweet death of sucking water into my lungs and never hearing this bickering, awful family again.By the 90 minute mark I was convinced that these were some of the most vile, hideous creatures on the face of the earth. They had no redeeming qualities at all. All I could think of was the line from Aliens, ""Nuke them from orbit. It's the only way to be sure.""By the 121 minute mark, I was grateful it was over. Meryl was alone in the house, Julia had left, and we had no resolution to a story we had suffered through for two hours.I'm not opposed to dark films. I'm not opposed to sad films. I'm not opposed to films that try to qualify and explain the human condition. But what I am opposed to is a film that makes no effort to be ENTERTAINING.August: Osage County is a film that doesn't give a crap if the audience is entertained. It's too busy showing how smart and edgy it is.",August - Osage County

Angry, bitter hurtful women and ineffective, brow beaten men verbally duke it out (And go for award nominations in the process!). I don't know how the cast didn't turn into raging alcoholics after living these characters and this life for several months. Suicide, drug and alcohol abuse, cancer, incest, infidelity, verbal and emotional abuse, angst, betrayal, abandonment, etc...etc...etc... Makes ""Macbeth"" look like light comedy.

172,Cs_The_Moment,Beautifully Dysfunctional,9,8 March 2014,"I was excited to see this film, having seen the play a few years ago at the theatre where I worked. I was captivated by the story and the tense style of the setting and was curious to see whether the same effect could be created on screen, and I wasn't disappointed. Set mainly in a dark, stuffy house, you get an instant feel for the back story of secrets and suppression as soon as it begins.The film opens quietly but throwing you instantly into the turmoil of the main character Violet, portrayed by Meryl Streep, and her dysfunctional family. As the story begins to unfold you get a real sense of the afflictions facing each character and the scenes and dialogue flow from one spilt secret to the next, and it is captivating to watch Streep wholeheartedly embrace the role. The acting and setting really bring this story to life: watching, I felt like I experienced every emotion and heartache; and got an overwhelming sense of the mania of being trapped in the Weston household, just as I felt watching it on stage. The acting is first class: Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts are on top form and I felt this was one of their best performances. Impressive performances were also given by actors that I am less familiar with such as Chris Cooper, Margo Martindale, and Juliette Lewis. Surprisingly though my heart was stolen away by one of the smallest characters through an incredibly sweet and humble performance by Benedict Cumberbatch. I'm a fan of his other work and it was enjoyable to watch him in a role that is so far away from his recent characters - portraying the awkward but endearing role of Little Charles.Tracy Lett's story flows beautifully, although it is very dialogue-heavy so if you're more of an action fan you may get restless. There are also plenty of plot twists and turns which keep you captivated. The culmination of the film is dark and edgy and full of emotion, and I'm still in two minds about whether I found the ending satisfying, but in a way the not-so-perfect final scene is fitting for such a raw piece. The style reminds me of Silver Linings Playbook (2012) in the way it makes you feel like you've lived through it whilst watching the story, and I would definitely recommend this film if you enjoyed that. This isn't a typical happy ending film but it is refreshingly real and beautifully portrayed.",August - Osage County

174,AfroPixFlix,The Meanest Reunion of All involves FAMILY,8,17 April 2014,"When you think of great dysfunctional family plays set to film, you think of Edward Albee (Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?), Tennessee Williams (Streetcar Named Desire), and now August: Osage County by Tracy Letts. There's so much palpable tension reeking from every word here that you need to cool off with a mint julep midway through. This is a study of meanness. No, I mean real meanness. The type that comes from the enemies who know best where to strike to kill: your family. Set in the hot, flat, and insular Oklahoma plains, this drama is a splendid canvas upon which master actor Meryl Streep showcases her skills (she nailed the Okie drawl, BTW). Thirty years ago, Oklahoma was also the setting of one of her early masterpieces, Silkwood. She's returned with a cast of crazies whipped up with tornadic force by America's treasured writer Letts (also an Oklahoman). Being a better stage production than film, this work seems claustrophobic at times, but that works to its advantage. After all, you can't escape a nutty family! As a bonus, it features a brief appearance by Sam Shepard (Paris, Texas) as the force whose departure everyone must reckon with. Is there such a thing as a generation curse for hell- raising? AfroPixFlix says check out this sad yet witty drama and see for yourself.",August - Osage County
175,jul-kinnear,"If I were to sum up August: Osage County in one word, it would likely be ""intense.""",8,5 February 2014,"Upon learning their father has gone missing, the three daughters of Beverly and Violet Weston return to their parents' country home in Oklahoma. Nearly a dozen characters are introduced into the family arena — each with their own personal demons — and many face-offs ensue. Drug addiction, hidden romance, emotional abuse, divorce, and bourgeoning adolescence are just some of the many themes tackled over the course of the film. Between their own personal struggles and their complex family history, the sisters are in for a tough few days in each other's company.Lately, with series like Harry Potter and books like The Hobbit turning into movies, we're getting pretty accustomed to seeing cinematic versions of novels. But it isn't every day that you get to see a compelling play like August: Osage County turned into a film. Even more intriguing is the fact that the playwright, Tracy Letts, adapted his original work, which premiered onstage in 2007, to create the screenplay for this 2013 film rendition.If your main requirements when selecting a movie are strong acting performances and intense family drama, then August: Osage County is definitely worth seeing. You're likely to be drawn in by how the film looks at challenging familial relations with an intriguing dark humour twist. And with an all-star cast that includes Meryl Streep, Julia Roberts, Ewan McGregor, Dermot Mulroney, Abigail Breslin, Benedict Cumberbatch, and many more — along with a brilliant breakout performance by Julianne Nicholson — there's nothing but superb actors in the bunch.Unlike in the days of classic movies, the trend in films lately has been towards more ""real,"" improvised language, which probably leaves you more familiar with common, ""everyday"" speech on screen. Because of this, some of August: Osage County's language might feel a little more theatrical than what you're used to seeing on screen in recent years. Fortunately, the strong, committed actors manage to work with this heightened language and drama very well.If I were to sum up August: Osage County in one word, it would likely be ""intense."" But not in the guns-a-blazing, action-packed Die Hard–style sense of the word. Rather, this movie is about real pain, the dramatic consequences of secrecy and revelation, and how families struggle to keep things together even through the toughest times. So if you want to appreciate the strong performances and unique experience of seeing a Pulitzer Prize–winning play adapted for the screen, make sure you're in the right mood for it. Because if you are, August: Osage County won't just be intense for you, but it will also be brilliant.",August - Osage County

178,charmadu,A Dream Cast - almost,8,13 October 2013,"I just saw AOC at the Mill Valley Film Festival. I was familiar with the play and knew about the two endings. I was thrilled to learn it had been filmed in Osage County and the cinematography was a treat. I was delighted to see Meryl (Violet Weston) and Chris Cooper (Charles Aiken) working again together. Meryl is a shoe-in for Best Actress - if they push her into Best Supporting Actress nominee, there should be a massive protest. Chris Cooper should be nominated as well. Julianne Nicholson is perfect in the role of Ivy Weston as is Benedict Cumberbatch as Little Charles. Their story is the most heartbreaking one as it's so difficult to imagine them surviving at all, much less in New York City. They both should be nominees for Best Supporting Actress/Actor. I wish Margo Martindale (perfectly cast as Mattie Fae Aiken) had had more, and Julia Roberts (Barbara Weston) less screen time. Sam Shepherd was also wonderful, although his part is so teeny. But I think the problems in the original script carried over to the screenplay: Karen's boyfriend Steve (Dermot Mulroney) is written way too heavy handedly - child molesters do not announce themselves in a new family setting as loudly as he does. And the scene where teenage Jean (Abigail Breslin)gets caught with Steve and finally confronts her father Bill (Ewan McGregor), is completely undermined by our not seeing any reaction whatsoever from Bill to his daughter. This is directly due to Bill being written as another one of those ""aren't I a nice guy"" types. We already have a real ""nice guy"" in the Chris Cooper/Charles Aiken character, and he has some legs to stand on. In contrast, the Ewan McGregor/Bil Fordham character sorely lacks that integrity. But it's Roberts who really undermines things for me - because she has so much screen time and just isn't a good enough actress to pull off her role - her anger comes across as just shallow, there's nothing really solid behind it. I didn't believe she grew up in that house for a second. Watching her, I found myself imagining what Amy Morton (the actress who played Barbara Weston on Broadway) would have done with the role. What a loss for those of us who will never get to see THAT performance. Tonight at the film festival, they showed the supposedly second ""happy"" ending featuring Julia Roberts. To me, it made it painfully obvious how much she couldn't pull it off. If she gets nominated for Best Actress, there should be a massive protest. So here are my nominees: Best Actress: Meryl Streep; Best Supporting Actress: Julianne Nicholson; Best Supporting Actor: Chris Cooper and Benedict Cumberbatch",August - Osage County
179,Joe_Chadowski,"Not Excellent. It's Delivery and Tone is Inconstant, but the Acting and Tenacity is Something to Behold",7,1 April 2014,"You should always take note when a play becomes a film. The storytelling method is vastly different, and offers and very unique experience; Deep, deep character analysis and long extended take sequences move the story along to an ending that always requires post-credit discussion. Even when the results are good-not-great, as here with August: Osage County, you can't look away until you know how it ends.August: Osage Country features one of the most dysfunctional families projected on film. (One does hear about a certain family in Texas that likes chainsaws, but let's not split hairs.) Three dysfunctional daughters return with their home after their dysfunctional father dies, and their mentally unstable, depressed, pill-popping dysfunctional mother eggs on unpleasant confrontations and reveals harsh truths.This is a film that starts out bleak, and gets even bleaker. But that's not to say August is a downer. On the contrary, it's a fascinating character study with venom-laced ideologue that unbearingly peels away the layers, and shocks you with its tenacity. It's fun in a devilish sort of way, and the acting from the ensemble cast so immensely good, you can't help but guiltily enjoy yourself.My frustrations are centered on the inconsistent tone of the film. August is at times bitingly funny, and at times deeply emotional, but it never quite finds the right balance of the two notions that would have made it a stellar film. The result is an indirect collection of scenes with a rigid feel to them, lacking the cohesive flowing feel it should have had. Were it not for the incredible acting and the deep script, the lack of tonality would've gotten the better of August.Drawbacks aside, August: Osage County defines what I love about film and the essential, simple joy I get from watching. A well written story that doesn't spoon-feed you information and requires a little analysis is brought to life by amazing performances from an unparalleled cast. Progress these days demands films be developed solely for profit margin, and to demand less from the viewer. So I'm grateful for this film and films like it.",August - Osage County

No other awards, so i thought it must be one of those dark movies which i don't get or care about, which only rely on good acting. but i went anyway because im so faithful to Meryl Streep. and im glad i did. i don't think i need to talk about the performances. i mean its Meryl Streep!!! and Julia Roberts!! and the rest of the cast were all so so so good. i really believe that Meryl Streep is being taken for granted!! i think she deserves all 17 Oscars she have been nominated for. and i think the academy don't want to give her a record of best win. but if someone has to have this record, shouldn't it be her !!!this movie should have been nominated for best screenplay as well. I've never seen a black comedy which was really funny and sad in the same time. it was beautifully written. OK, now that I've got rid of my anger towards the academy lets talk about the movie. this movie is not for everyone, because it relies on the acting and script more than anything else. most of the movie happens in a dark ugly house and the cast argue about many things. you will get the deep meaning when you read between the lines. for example, in the last scene when Julia was very confused about what she would do with her mother now that everyone has left. she came back home and had the last argument with her mother where she kept saying how strong she is and said even if everything vanish I will still be here. in here Julia realizes that this is true and hugged her mom and left. then she stopped to take a deep breath and smiled (because she knew that now she wont blame herself and that she stayed till the end and she has closure, unlike last time). also the problems between Julia and her husband are so real. when you don't know what is wrong but you fight anyway. this is illustrated in the scene when he finally decided to leave her and she told him so we will never know what went wrong, and he said i guess we wont.strangely enough, as much as this family was disturbing I laughed so hard. i guess because they made me feel that my family are sane.",August - Osage County

We hope we will see more (NOT all cake-face makeup) of these REAL-LIFE women in future movies. My favorite part of this movie was when Julia Roberts goes ballistic on her mother (not saying that disrespect towards your mother is right) but the mother (Meryl Streep) was sooo bad, putting everybody down and rude too. You will understand why the mother is this way (later in the movie). Juliette Lewis was the only one wearing makeup. I felt very sorry for her in one scene. Most women would have walked away (in her situation). I really liked the American Indian (or Native American woman) in this movie, she showed courage.

Saw the play at the National Theatre with most of the original New York cast and found it obvious and sit-com my. Oddly the film which by the way has lost all the laughs the play engendered, presents a much more serious and grim portrait. Meryl the magnificent is not so magnificent in this though she at times grasps the inner feeling of the mother. Unfortunately, she also tends to go way over the top a few too many times. Julia Roberts has been directed in a more angry and vindictive manner than the original Tony winning actress I saw on stage. I always love Julia but this is not her most pleasant role. The humor has been left on the stage and not made its way to the screen. At least the film avoids the glib, ""oh, look at me, I am so clever"" feeling of the play.",August - Osage County

The middle sister has spent her life taking care of her parents she never left town and she has all of these things going on in her life but as typical with middle children she is ignored and so she is long suffering finally finding love in the arms of her first cousin who is really her half brother thanks to her aunt and fathers affair. No one is the wiser until the aunt tells the eldest sister the long known but not spoken secret that their cousin was really their half brother and in fact what was cousins in love with each other is really brother and sister in love with each other.The youngest sister lives in a world all of her own she is for lack of a better world a ditz the kind that ignores the obvious to get along and pretend that everything is right with the world. Her latest fiancé is really a pedophile which is shown after he smokes pot with her niece and then tries to see the 14 year old's breast. The only thing that saved that 14 year old is the native American helper that the husband hired before he rowed out on a boat and then drowned himself.Basically this family is messed up and there is no denying that. Julia Roberts as the eldest winces a lot and looks put upon and just like a sheet of granite because she is the oldest and the toughest. The middle girl is lovelorn before she starts sleeping with her cousin/brother and the youngest is willing to ride off into the sunset with a pedophile because she wants to go to Belize and this pedophile can help her dreams come true. There is no resolution in this movie. Everyone abandons the mother, and everyone goes their own way with their lives a little less ordered and with some kind of emotional wound inflicted from this gathering. It's a snapshot into dysfunction in the Midwest, I don't know why this kind of work is applauded. I don't know why anyone would want to sit here and willingly watch a jerry springer type movie of dysfunction just watch a reality show or a talk show if you are into dysfunction and horrible people. This was a waste of time for me and I feel like there should have been some kind of resolution but there wasn't and I feel like I will never get closure next time I will follow my first mind and not watch a movie I know I won't like.

""August: Osage County""; based on a powerful play written by Tracy Letts - it won the Pulitzer Prize. And the film is probably going to rock the movie theaters. This film IS NOT for everyone. It's exhausting, it's full of really dreadful people, and its gloomy too. But the acting is so good, the roles are so solid, that you don't wanna miss it.It's the story of the Weston family: Violet, a drug-addicted cancer patient (Meryl Streep); her husband Beverley, an award-winning poet (Sam Shepard); their three daughters Barbara (Julia Roberts), Ivy (Julianne Nicholson) and Karen (Juliette Lewis); Violet's sister Minnie Fae (Margo Martindale), her husband Charles (Chris Cooper), and their son Little Charles (Benedict Cumberbatch). There is also Barbara's Husband Bill (Ewan McGregor) and Karen's fiancée Steve (Dermot Mulroney). They all gather at the funeral of Beverley, and the story begins.Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts were so damn good that am already feeling bad for academy award nominees for the best actress and the best supporting actress category! this is probably the best ensemble of the year.

187,ninetails888,The Performance Aren't Enough to Outshine the Flaws,6,26 January 2014,"Based off of Tracy Letts' darkly comedic play, August: Osage County comes to the big screen in hopes of capturing audiences hearts with its strongly character-driven story and big names. It wants to say, ""Hey, this family is more dysfunctional than yours!"" and it succeeds. But August: Osage County treads familiar grounds and it doesn't seem like John Wells tried to reinvent anything. I can bet you've seen this story before. A family gets together in a time of mourning but their coming together only creates greater tensions between family members. August: Osage County, for the most part, follows that same formula. But the real problem with it is, there's too much unresolved drama. You just don't leave the theater feeling like you've had a fun experience. It's not as exhausting as it is depressing. But, don't get me wrong, this film has its fair share of genuinely moving moments that feature incredible performances. Meryl Streep gives one of the performances of the year as the pill- popping, mean old lady that is constantly bullying her family members until she can't possibly torment them any more. The things her character says are gut-wrenching but Streep's performance is so soulfully heartbreaking that you can forgive her almost immediately. Julia Roberts gives a very simple, brutally raw performance as Barbara, the daughter of Meryl Streep. She's an un-glamorous spectacle to see in August: Osage County and is deserving of her Best Supporting Actress nomination. The ensemble that makes up August: Osage County is incredible as well. Abigail Breslin has grown up since her breakout performance in Little Miss Sunshine and we've seen her since in this year's The Call. She's better in August: Osage County as a teenager who's flaws and poor decision making make up almost her entire character. Margo Martindale is great, as is Chris Cooper who plays her husband.The performances don't outshine every flaw of August: Osage County, though. The drama is at times heavy-handed and the director sometimes threatens to almost beat you over the head with it. The comedy worked sometimes but other times, it just doesn't. August: Osage County struggles with a generic story, sometimes heavy- handed drama but most of all, just doesn't make you feel at all good after watching. But there are many stellar performances here and at times, the film is genuinely moving. I can't say I strongly disliked August: Osage County at all or even disliked it but it isn't a great movie.I give August: Osage County a B-.Read all of my reviews at www.thecheapseatsfilmreviews.weebly.com!""",August - Osage County
188,Siren555,Julia Roberts is the Brilliant Surprise,7,19 January 2014,"The most amazing thing about this movie is Julia Roberts' acting. Meryl Streep is so consistently great in dramatic roles that her brilliance is a foregone conclusion, practically a cliché. But Roberts proves that she, too, is a dramatic tour de force. Roberts has always had a certain charisma as an actress, even (and perhaps especially) as early as Mystic Pizza. While it's true that she won an Oscar for Erin Brockavich, that performance was nothing compared with her turn as eldest daughter Barbara in August: Osage County.Maybe playing opposite the great Meryl Streep raised Roberts to her A game. Or maybe Roberts has matured, or perhaps this just was the perfect role for her. Whatever the reason, Julia Roberts has proved, without a doubt, that she is very, very fine actress. Most surprising wasvthe power she brought to her portrayal of Barbara, the oldest of three daughters of Meryl Streep's character, Violet. Violet is tough and verbally vicious, but Roberts does a brilliant job showing that Barbara can be just as tough, standing toe to toe not only with Streep's character but with Streep herself as an actress. Fans of fine acting will really appreciate seeing Streep and Roberts acting together. There are plenty of obvious, big moments between them, and all the more intriguing are the quieter ones. At one point, Streep's character breaks into tears and, at the end of the scene improvises quickly blowing her nose into a tissue (which, of course, in true Streep fashion is perfect for her character). In that moment Roberts deftly plays right along, giving just the right kind of subtle reaction.So here's the good news: performing in August:Osage County with Streep raised Roberts' acting to an Oscar-worthy level. Here's the bad news: if you're a lead actress in the same dramatic film with Meryl Streep -- even if you have a considerably larger role -- about the only way you might win an Oscar is in the Best Supporting Actress category. Which is exactly what Julia Roberts is nominated for this year.",August - Osage County
189,kriddirk,"""Oscar performances"" in an American family drama",9,17 January 2014,"Didn't see the Theater performance, but in any way I prefer not to compare between film, book or theater play. Let us be clear about the cast, it had some promises, isn't it ?! And yes, Julia and Meryl are more then superb. There performance is better in any way I could expect. For Meryl you think it is normal, she is always that good, but that said : She is a superb actress with several Oscar nominations and she is a phenomena. Also now she plays that cynic drug slaved family ""monster"" spitting out all the true about her 3 daughter family, hurting and driving to the limit each of them. The family dinner is the max of the movie in which each actor can show what he is worth and they do so. Julia Roberts does her role as bitter woman as a super performance. She is that hard as her mother Violet ( Meryl ) and gives reply to her. 2 Oscar performances, nothing more to say about that. It has been a long time that Julia proves to be that actress we know from Brockovich or Closer. The movie is a straight family drama with some turns you don't expect and which makes all even more hard. Typical American ? I don't think so. A family from which father and mother have problems and from which the children move out to other states or countries in Europe. It sounds familiar. May be the typical is the American wide and lonely landscapes and sites, like Oklahoma or the West. I would like to mention Chris Cooper for his so sensitive performance in a hard shell, very good actor. No action, blood and action movie, but a real cast performance movie .. wasn't that the purpose of movies ?!!

Just when you think you have the story figured out, there's a huge twist.Meryl Streep is amazing, and it makes you understand that we are the way we are by part in how we are raised, and it's not always a happiness. She made you believe that she really WAS an unstable pill popping addict, when she knew what was ""really going on"" all along.You could feel the pain in Ivy and Little Charles for feeling like they weren't good enough for anyone. The anger from Barbara for finally realizing she is really a lot like her mother. The disappointment from Charles for always hearing his wife berate ""their son"".

I love Meryl Streep but I can just imagine Sissy Spacek being the matriarch or Margo Martingale herself -- point is the story is even stronger than the acting itself.The accidental incest just adds icing to the cake. That was unexpected. Julia Roberts is perfect and so was Julianne but Julie Wilson this is not quirky enough for what I expect her to be so maybe a bit of a waste . but both are talented they can switch roles easily and we don't have the redhead stereotype but hey I did not read the original play.Really interested in the missing pieces from the original play.",August - Osage County

If you want to see a two-hour train wreck in slow motion, without any cool CGI special effects, you're in the right place! This is mostly a character study of dysfunctional and unpleasant family members. On the plus side, after watching you are almost certain to think your life is pretty good after all!

That will be enough for you to be mesmerized by two hours, never taking his eyes off another sweeping performance of these cinema's goddess (yes, she deserved to have won his 4th Oscar) and win bonus, some of the most intense and memorable dramatic scenes of recent times.If production has a cadence and end more suitable to the theatrical universe, and that some characters be wasted, become, after all, just details forward to the pleasure of watching another journey of total surrender of Mrs. Streep.",August - Osage County

I don't know how much of the constant bickering was actually scripted but it came off as bad improv you would expect to witness if you sat in with a group of local wannabe actors ""working on their craft"". In many parts it was more pantomime that acting, particularly Streep.

And all that reaping and sowing. I think it was spot-on. You can continue the reaping. Or you can try to sow something new. The movie leaves you to decide which of those paths makes the most sense.

198,bighebeal,Fine acting. Script is trash.,2,5 January 2014,"In the late 19th century a common playwriting trope was to build a play to moments of intensity where the star would astonish the audience with the brilliance of his or her acting. The plays had no real purpose other than to provide those moments; there was no dramatic core, no purpose to them other than that. Those kinds of plays, like ""The Count of Monte Cristo"", which O'Neill skewers in ""Long Day's Journey Into Night"", are dismissed today as tripe, as dated and manipulative nonsense.""August: Osage County"" is exactly that, only modern and written for an ensemble cast rather than for a single star. Sure, the acting is very good, but so what? Who cares? Where's the story? What's the point? Why are we spending time with these people?Understand, my complaint is not that ""August: Osage County"" is depressing, it's that it's cheap. Many fine movies are miserably depressing, but they're honest, they're driven by something other than a desire to create 'actory' moments; ""The Swimmer"" comes to mind, as does ""The Night Porter"", and ""Enemies: A Love Story"", and ""The Bicycle Thief"", and ""Ikiru""... This thing, on the other hand... it feels like Tracy Letts just piled misery upon misery upon misery for no reason other than his belief that that gets you taken seriously. And considering the awards the play received, he was right, which hardly speaks well for the state of dramatic criticism.At one point (spoiler ahead), after he's already been larding the suffering on with a trowel for quite a while, there's a death scene -- and while watching it I just couldn't help myself, I laughed out loud.Seriously, what is the point of this? In playwriting class, the first principle they teach is that ""drama is the day the change occurred"". In other words, if there is no chance of change, if the characters (at least the protagonist) are not wrestling with an inner conflict that could resolve itself several ways, then there is no drama. That's the case with ""August: Osage County"". You might as well be watching a B-Western for all the real depth there is to the characters. Each time you're introduced to a character (with one or two very minor exceptions) you know exactly who they are now and exactly who they'll be at the end of the movie. It's just 'sound and fury, signifying nothing'.In a word, trash.",August - Osage County

A miserable collection of mean, addicted, distraught, and depressed family, which as individuals, might be believable, but as a group is preposterous. You wouldn't want to spend five minutes with any of them, let alone two hours. And, no, it has nothing to say about addiction or family. It seems to have little to say about anything except that the people on screen can't stand to be with each other any longer than they have to, and after this they won't see each other again. Lots of fun for the cast, and maybe even an Oscar or two, hopefully at least a nomination for Julianne Nicholson. No fun at all for the audience. This won a Pulitzer and Tonys?

200,hellojaeson,Takes you to places Avatar couldn't. Brilliant. Sad. Funny. Heart-breaking.,10,6 March 2014,"Part 1 - Spending Time with a Bunch of Aliens -------------------------------------Movies, plays or songs take us into someone else's reality. We are brought into someone's idea of family. It isn't something sweet or warm, but it is part of someone's perception of family. I think the trailers should have warned the audience about how draining this family interactions can be. But I urge anyone who even wants to watch this to consider that you're visiting a planet that you may or may not be familiar with. A planet you may or may not enjoy visiting. However... as someone who has family orbiting this cruel side of the human heart I can assure you that very little of how the characters interact are a fiction. For that, I admire the way the director and editor and screenwriter and actors were able to take away away from our own cozy existence and plunge us headlong into this melodramatic horrific place. Is it watchable? Not really. It's tragic and heart breaking. Is it Worth Watching? By all accounts, if you come from this kind of family, it helps you realize you're not the only one who lived like this once upon a time. If you're married to someone who has problems speaking about their past, this film might open your eyes and heart to getting a glimpse of the ravaged human heart and the fodder it leaves behind. I find it sad that we can invest our hearts into war films that tell us how futile war is, but when it comes to seeing real people at war with no end in sight, no victories worth celebrating, we tell audiences that it's a waste of time. If war is a waste of time... then perhaps we should say so and act like it and stop watching the whole damned ordeals altogether. It's an A grade film about F grade human souls. It's a horror story. A cautionary tale. A story about what happens when love fails us. A story that remind us how good we have it. A story to show us we deserve to be loved.Part 2 - What the movie made me feel ---------------------------------------------------- Meryl Streep brings out the best and the worst in her fellow actors.By this, I mean, she brings out the utter brilliance from others around her.In August: Osage County, the world you visit is not the one you are likely to want to revisit. It orbits around pain and hurt and betrayals so deep that people who live there resort to drinking and pills in order to stay away from their most murderous instinct. If they didn't listen to music, dance till their bones ached, fought with strangers or curse out their own family... the people who live in this universe would find a gun with so many bullets they would bleed the skulls of every single human being on the planet.Make no mistake, this is not a happy film. It will not make you feel great about the planet we live in. It might even make you consider a long jump off a very short pier and never resurface again.So with all that I'm saying that's so horribly dark about this film, why watch it?One word: Love.The film is ultimately about Love.You've read other synopsis-es here saying that it's a film about a dysfunctional emotional bully of a Matriarch who breaks down her daughters and relatives. And to an extent yes, that's the surface of the story. However, what makes this story move is how everyone in the movie want to go from a place of loss to a place of peace. They make really strange decisions to get there but each person in this very draining film do their best to achieve love they best way they know how.Even the Matriarch who is ultimately a selfish person, so self involved that she knows nothing about what love really is, has to settle for a store-bought version of love. And this ""love"" comes in the form of delusion, yearning and the unwillingness to be the change she wants in the world. In short, she doesn't give love, so she doesn't get love.The rest of the family fight for their version of this raw and all too real need. In the end as the credits roll, everyone in the audience were stunned to quiet unseated drained despair that life can be so hard for some of us on planet earth. It's not a pretty world we live in at times. We should be grateful if our lives are distanced by time and miles and opportunities to escape our toxic pasts.August: Osage County may be foreign for some people who come from loving parents and grand parents. This film is also for you. To remind you that our world isn't yet perfect and there's still room for a better way forward for us all. Love is still needed. It's still a commodity we haven't outstripped demand by an overabundant supply. This film still invites us towards our better days to come as a human race.For all the tumult and terrifying moments of angry backlash and unbearable cruelty, I myself appreciated that I am not the only one who grew up in a family I never asked for. It reminded me there were others out there dealing with far worse. A note to myself that we're all in this together, like it or not. To me, this film played like an ode to the end of wars, at home.Especially at home... so that perhaps they do not have to leak and seep out like raging poison to the unsuspecting world outside.",August - Osage County
201,cncontinuum88,Family dysfunction to the max.,8,20 January 2014,"So I've just been to see August;Osage County at the theater and I have to say I'm not too sure how I feel. I had heard and read how depressing and sad this movie is so I had to wait for the right frame of mind, however in retrospect nothing could of prepared me for what I experienced watching this amount of family dysfunction.now don't get me wrong! I have been a movie buff for 30 years now I know a good production when I see one, but WOW!!! I was able to relate to many of the characters and found their individual stories heartfelt and realistic, the story involving little Charles and Ivy was particularly touching, but while I was watching I was thinking 'how can these people be so mean to each other in the face of such tragedy?' It seems, according to some reviewers this is quite normal behaviour. Go figure! All the actors did a superb job in my mind, and seeing the list of Oscar nominations Ms Streep should most definitely win, in my opinion.I will admit that as I was watching this great piece of drama I was thinking, 'please let there be some sort of feel-good ending' - but no, not even. I will recommend this terrifically sad and depressing movie to others, for that is what I do for a job, however I might add a small warning with it. 'Don't watch if you have had a parent commit suicide, dying of cancer, siblings and relatives that are horrible to each other, and various amounts of skeletons itching to get out of the closet'. Prepare to be saddened, pick out any similarities within your own family unit, however small they may be, and maybe you can appreciate the value of your own family.

The matriarch is a bitter women who having felt abandoned by the children that she has never really loved, remorselessly attacks them when they return home out of a sense of duty. From here on any semblance of family unity breaks down as accusations fly and bitter memories of distrust and jealously are re-visited. The performances are all very good but the relentless journey by the mother towards self-destruction is exhausting, and unpleasant for the audience as well as the characters. I found the movie depressing and a little too self indulgent. Julia Roberts seems to play the hard faced bitch too well.

Plot, think of The Big Sleep goes to Zombie Land. It's about the Watson family gathering at the family homestead in Osage County, Oklahoma in August, to bury and honor the family patriarch, Bev Watson, well played by Sam Shepard - in a cameo, plus a few scenes, role.

206,asleep_soon,Fantastic,10,17 January 2014,"This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It had everything I love in a movie (or book, or TV show, etc.) - family drama with dysfunctional relatives, secrets, characters that come to life on screen. Also, the story is dark, but not as dark as I expected from the little I'd read online. I haven't seen the play on which this movie is based and I read no spoilers before attending the movie. If you enjoy movies that are literary in nature (not genre based) you may enjoy this one. There's no clear resolution, no happy ending. It's like spending a few days with people who are alarmingly real and flawed. If that kind of story makes you sad, don't watch it. I found it rather therapeutic, and not nearly as painful as a few days with my actual relatives. I would put this movie in the drama category, if forced to pick a genre. There were many laugh out loud moments (to me, at least) but I definitely would NOT call this a comedy, or even a dark comedy. I can see how maybe the play is more of a comedy, but the movie definitely is not. The acting was phenomenal, as you would expect from a cast like this. I could gush about any of them. I'm still laughing about Dermot Mulroney. He reminded me of the character he played in About Schmidt. Benedict Cumberbatch's role as perpetual disappointment Little Charles was a revelation as well. I already knew he was amazing but this was something I didn't expect from him. Any movie where I come away thinking of the minor characters as much as the main characters is a fantastic movie, in my opinion. I don't need a happy movie. Not a romantic comedy person here. I love movies that make me think, feel, reminisce, reflect. I want to feel a full array of emotions during a movie. This movie gave me that. I wish there were more like it.

The story here too is tight, too tight: almost ever character has a tragic story line. I give most of my points for the performances. Meryl Streep, Julia Roberts, Chris Cooper, Ewan McGregor, Sam Shepard, Julianne Nicholson, Benedict Cumberbatch are all first rate. Second rate, or perhaps the characters were Juliette Lewis and Dermot Mulroney. Margo Martindale, who seems a natural comic actress to me, overplayed her part for my taste.",August - Osage County

This was acting taken to another level, superb. The whole thing may revolve around a short space of time in limited locations, but you get totally involved in the plot and acting.

209,colincec,Good... I think?,6,30 January 2014,"August: Osage County is a film about an extremely dysfunctional family that is not afraid to go to some very uncomfortable places. Every person in the family has some secrets or vices and in lesser hands, it might feel like a soap opera. Some instances do feel like a soap opera, but a very watchable one. I actually think that this is a movie designed to make the viewer feel uncomfortable, right down to the laughs and the implication by the end that Julia Roberts' character may have become as bad as her mother played by Meryl Street. The big weak point that I see, as loathe I am to admit it because I like him, is Benedict Cumberbatch; I found his character a little too melodramatic, he disappears for almost the entire third act, and it's hard to tell if his southern accent is convincing or not. I'm hesitant to recommend this movie because I feel like it's an acquired taste and you won't walk away from it feeling joyful, but at the very least, I enjoyed it, so take that for what it's worth.",August - Osage County

By the end of the film I was relieved to lock this dysfunctional family away in the DVD case they arrived in. I never saw this in a public venue, so I may have been missing audience cues but it could also be that the film's frenetic pace just left no time to react to the lighter moments in this script during the film.To sum up, this is a tough but fascinating film to watch, well worth your time.

Speaking only for myself, the relationship between Violet and Barbara is exactly the way my mother and I were once. I found myself relating to Violet's daughters, little Charles, and even with his father. I found everyone else to be despicable. It just goes to prove to me that not everyone can be or should be a parent. Overall, the film it was hard to watch. It hit close to home in fact. Violet drove her family away. Even though the film ended with Barbara driving off into the sunset assuming back to Colorado, you know that Violet dies with only the caregiver and possibly Mattie Fae by her side.

Just wow.,9,20 April 2014,"If you, or someone you know, harks from a childhood punctuated by emotional abuse and abandonment, you will recognize (uncomfortably recognize) many of the themes touched on in this film – how hateful words cut and strafe the soul, the cost of surviving in this kind of environment, children flying out of these abusive homes at the speed of light as soon as they can cut free, the lasting scars that never seem to completely heal, tragi-comic coping skills (Juliette Lewis's Karen), the legacy of emotional abuse as the ugly gift that keeps on giving, down through generations.Emotional violence begets emotional violence, as embodied in Julia Roberts' Barbara. Roberts and Meryl Streep are riveting in their pas de deux throughout this play-film, crafting rightfully lauded performances. Another sparkling gem here, imho, is Ivy, played by Julianne Nicholson. Nicholson's nuanced performance captivates -- she has arrived as an A lister, in my book. An actor's actor, too. I tip my hat as well to Chris Cooper, who just keeps evolving on the screen, with rich and deep performances.This film is an adaptation of the play, evident throughout the film's distinctive ebb and flow, a sense of division into acts and scenes, and staging that acknowledges August: Osage County's origins on the boards in a work by Tracy Letts. I am intrigued now to read the play, and see it performed on stage. Personally I am fond of cinematic adaptations from theater (ex. Angels Over America, Cat On A Hot Tin Roof, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, etc.). There is a distinct tone and rhythm when this translation from stage to screen occurs. It is fascinating, if you love literature in general, to see how directors (John Wells in this case), make key choices to adapt a play for screen. It was smart to have the playwright create the script in this case, an eloquent adaptation.The costume and styling design work was excellent too. Notice the hair of the three sisters, Barbara, Ivy and Karen, and of Streep and her sister counterpart. Wardrobe as well tells a story, reflecting emotional shifts and changes, and punctuating arcs in the storyline, as does the soundtrack (and the gorgeous acoustic rendering of Last Mile Home by Kings of Leon).Also, the use of environment must be noted, in the architecture of the family home, the vast open plains of Oklahoma, the still-rustic small towns that punctuate the landscape, and the storied history of the place, from Native American decimation (marked in a quiet, riveting performance by Misty Upham), rapid crazed settlement (the Oklahoma Sooners), the madness-inducing heat of the place, and the dysfunction bred by poverty, isolation, and ignorance – still a prominent feature of plains life.We all get wounded, we all have dysfunction in our families. Some more than others. In this film, you will find traces of yourself and your family, amplified to an almost unbearable level. If you do not, you had an exemplary childhood, and you probably do not exist. And yet, I found solace in this moving, beautifully crafted cinematic tour de force. There is escape, there is a life outside the plains, there is the whisper of a possibility of a chance of what it takes to begin healing. A second viewing leaves me equally touched and moved. As my review title says -- WOW.",August - Osage County
217,zquintofan,Is There Anything Lower Than A 1 Star Rating?,1,20 March 2014,"If there is I would give it lower. This has got to be the most boring film I have ever seen. The very fact that it had to include so many famous actors and actresses was a warning signal for me and I have to say I'm glad I didn't spend money on this. What a waste of time. In truth I really wanted to watch this because it had Benedict Cumberbatch in it. I saw him in Sherlock, Star Trek, The Fifth Estate, and 12 Years A Slave (the last two were atrocious, not because of the acting but the writing and directing were really bad). When I found out that Julia Roberts, Abigail Breslin, and Ewan McGregor were in it I practically had a field day. With such a great cast how could the film go wrong? I soon found out exactly how.The entire family is crazy, not just one or two of them, the entire family. Cousins are trying to inbreed, you have an overly depressed, incredibly racist mother, there's suicide (or what appears to be suicide), a cheating husband who's letting his daughter do drugs, this family has it all. And what's worse nobody has any redeeming qualities. They're all a bunch of angry looney toons who have nothing better to do than sit and fight, smoke weed, occasionally mate with another family member. I have to be fair and say that the actors were not the problem, they all did a fantastic job with their parts. But seriously, what were the writers thinking? I almost laughed at how bad it was. I'm just going to cut my complaining short and advise those fortunate enough to come across bad reviews to listen to them. This film was horrendously awful and why anyone would want to watch it is beyond my reasoning.",August - Osage County

219,upquist,Great Ensemble Piece - Odious Characters,8,12 January 2014,"I've seen ""Her"" and this movie - one after the other - and I draw parallels between them. In both we observe what Leon Festinger called ""cognitive dissonance"" among fundamentally selfish people who seem to know only how to take love from those around them. Tragically, they appear to lack the ability to give love back in any recognizable way. It leads to Joaquin Phoenix' character in ""Her"" wringing love out of a computer operating system just as, in this film, Violet finally resorts to pitiful succor from a housekeeper for whom she previously harboured little human compassion. Meryl Streep, Julia Roberts, Chris Cooper - everyone really - contributes brilliantly to a superb ensemble piece set against the stark, almost primordial background of Osage County. Here there are few distractions permitting one to escape from coming to grips with the equally primordial reality of the human condition. Everything is stripped away to its essence. We see a dysfunctional family for what it is played out for us as if it were a Greek tragedy. Indeed, just as the Greeks wanted us to do, we see just a bit of ourselves in this film. Does anyone not admit to seeing that small part of us which has never grown up beyond the needs of suckling baby - painstakingly etched against this austere setting by the portrayals of each character in the movie? Films like ""Fargo"" or ""Brokeback Mountain"" and, of course, this one, all having similar backdrops, all do well at focusing our attention on the human drama. The veneer of civilization barely conceals the psychically lurking undercurrent of deep and disturbing desires, needs, wants, passions and agonies with which we must all contend, measured against greater or lesser sanguinity.At the very end of the song ""John Wayne Gacy Jr."", composer Sufjan Stevens writes:And in my best behaviorI am really just like himLook beneath the floorboardsFor the secrets I have hid I thought of those words as I watched this movie and I wondered how many of us have the courage to say to ourselves, ""These characters may be odious but what they are portraying is real and there is a small part of each them in every one of us"".",August - Osage County

221,scott1-912-252003,"Fantastic acting, work of art.",10,25 May 2014,"Art isn't always pleasant. Especially when you are looking at pure reality directly in the face of addiction, alcoholism, infidelity, and divorce. Some reviewers have complained that they thought the acting was good, but the story unpleasant. They didn't enjoy the story because of how awful the characters were, and subject matter as depressing. Well, this is what makes the film, and the character's dialog is absolutely ingenious. The first child (Julia Roberts) has a lot of pieces to pick up, and then she has to shatter them. She is the ""adult"" who can't stomach her mother's drug addiction, and left because of her father's alcoholism. But she returns to try and be a parent to her mother and younger siblings when her father goes missing. This all falls apart. Not because of her inabilities, but because everyone is so far dysfunctional, her efforts are in vain. Meanwhile, she has her own miserable divorce happening, along with her own child who reeks of indifference toward her. Meryl Streep is a master actress, who plays the drug addict beautifully. She is the destroyer of the family and herself, but she was raised by a real bitch of a mother in a really terrible childhood. Her husband, Sam Shepard is a cheating alcoholic who spent his early childhood years living in a car with his homeless family. Both parents are wise people, but suffer the demons of their youth. They carry this pain into addiction and coldness, which shattered their kids. The eldest daughter is the ""parent"". The middle daughter is a quiet mess loner, and the youngest daughter a clingy, vain woman who talks too much and gold digs to escape, no matter how terrible the fiancé' turns out to be. The absolute best part of this film is the family funeral dinner. These actors must have either rehearsed for a year, or improvised the entire scene. Either way, it was the best piece of team acting I've seen, ever. The dialog in this film was very intelligent and meaningful. I really identified with the Julia Roberts character's open thoughts about the world. Actually, I also could relate to the father and his brother in law, which is very rare for me. Most movies out of Hollywood are just too damned liberally tainted, with cliché' references to ""Paris"" and politically correctness. This movie did ""Belize"" and the argument about political correctness was realistic as hell. I really liked that Hollyweird did something right for once. In one particular scene, the aunt asks her husband to feel her sweaty back. They are playing around and that is really a director's gem in this film. It was funny and I also loved the interaction over who was drinking in the living room. The writer and director really had a grasp on real situational family dynamics. The Ferrari was hilarious and a nice touch. Lots of dark situational humor. I recommend this film to those who will understand the reason for it to exist, and for that you have to have a brain, or have been in a family situation which dealt with addiction. Remember that you are in the audience, not in the room with them, so you can take yourself out of that emotion if you want. If you decide you don't like the people/characters, you can still respect them, the acting, the situation, the masterful plot, and dynamics of the dialog. I gave this film a 10 because of the acting, humor, and realism.",August - Osage County
222,galileosmth,Could not relate,5,27 March 2014,"I'll bet August: Osage County is a very good movie. In fact, I'm sure of it. Unfortunately pretty much every character in the film was aggravating. I'm not sure why any of them would want to continue living, given their various behaviors and their views on life. Personally, I could not relate. Not even a smidgen, thank god. I can not relate to a lot of films, of course, but those are either sci-fi, westerns, or comedies.Still, I take nothing away from Meryl Streep, Julia Roberts, and the rest of the cast. They were all excellent. The movie was just so unrealistically a bummer that I could not get into it.

223,GrassRootsGuy,"Wear a flack vest, fasten your seat belt and see it",8,12 January 2014,"Watching this was like seeing the opening scenes of ""Saving Private Ryan"" set in a dining room. Machine gun verbal abuse fired straight at the heart in all directions. Not a wasted line. Every utterance loaded with import. Every character revealing some new flaw or history in every word. In the end - many will disagree - a redemption for almost all. Note the Indian woman. The only one not in the family and the only one who can take decisive action and do what needs to be done - with a shovel. Note the scene where Barbara's daughter is leaving with her father and the car window rolls up and Barbara sees herself. Oscar worthy for whoever constructed that scene. Note the mentions of the word truth and how it truth is used as a weapon to flagellate. Note how the audience gasps at the big reveal about Little Charlie. Note that almost everyone, in the end, has done what they needed to do which is to run - don't walk - run from this horrible yet ultimately sympathetic character (two efficient sound bites tell the whole story about generations of something beyond dysfunction) who has ruined all their lives. And note, and see what you think, about the mileage road sign at the very end... Like watching Private Ryan, I could barely stand the pain and couldn't take my eyes of the screen. And like Omaha Beach, this Oklahoma movie is littered with the dead and dying, though some still breathe. ###",August - Osage County
224,peibeck,"Delightful Dysfunction ""August: Osage County""",9,17 November 2013,"Though nearly 40 minutes of Tracy Lett's Pulitzer Prize winning dramedy have been shaved for the screen version, ""August: Osage County"" still manages to deliver on the towering play's hearty laughs, gasp inducing shocks, and well earned tears.While it is hardly the best adaptation of a play to a film, as much of the film still retains it's indoor, staging setting, it is boosted by some sterling performances of actors at the top of their craft. Chris Cooper and Margo Martindale are stellar, playing off each other with deft and precise timing. Julia Roberts has not had this good of a role in... ever, and she mostly delivers. Julianne Nicholson is both quiet yet fiercely determined as middle daughter Ivy. Sam Sheppard is amazing in the even more truncated role of the Weston family patriarch who goes missing, and Misty Upham is so good with so little to say as the young Indian woman, Johnna, tossed into a family in turmoil.Of course the turmoil is led by the Medea-of-the-Midwest, Violet, played for every ounce by Meryl Streep in one of her most indelible performances ever. While viewers will surely be talking about the ""infamous"" post funeral dinner scene, the price of admission should be had for Streep's monologue late into the ""second act,"" where she sits with her daughters on a swing set and discusses the worst Christmas ever: an acting class with the full gamut of emotion. Viewers may be equally divided by spending 130 minutes with such unhappy people, but there are plenty of dark laughs in Letts' screenplay to alleviate the tension. And with actors these good interpreting the parts, ""August: Osage County"" is easier to swallow than some awkward family dinners we've all had to attend at some point in our lives.",August - Osage County

No. Which one of us does? When we're in that pit, desperation, don't we all say ""anybody but me!""Nevertheless, Ivy's body language portends she has the power to destroy her mother; it's how she gets what she wants which is sex.The brother in law smokes a lot of grass to numb his pain. His shame. He's attracted to a young girl.The movie goes so fast because the family aspect is one that gets repeated over and over and over.The daughter is genuinely depressed and when Julia says we f&^%d the ""injuns"" for this vast wasteland of dead grass and dirt we see their desperation. In them, we see our collective desperation to deal with suicide and genocide.For how do we drive past 100,000s of dead spirits and not melt from pain? COMEDY. It's the antidote, a preventive.The wit of the mother is biting, the characters dialog, biting.All the secrets torn between their words and eyes.But Julia does remind us of a big duck, which is comforting.Anna Breslin, magnificent.Meryl is a ""time traveling wizard"" ; where she gets this gift is anyone's guess.This movie is so hard to watch because it's like staring your soul in the mirror, ah the humanity.

But if this is how a family like that behaves then count me the heck out. This family is bat-sh*t cray-cray. But, that is the reason I love this movie. The way these actors poured themselves in their roles was remarkable. This movie should have definitely been nominated for Best Picture. Julianne Nicholson was the best actor in this all-star cast. It was hard to upstage Oscar winners like Julia Roberts and Meryl Streep but she did so with GUSTO. The way she said that she has no sisters and she's related to these people due to random selection of cells really showed her capability as an actor. She surely deserved a nomination. She did a much better job than Sally Hawkins. This is the best movie I've seen in a long-long time. John Wells does an amazing job. Julia Roberts is really good in one of her best roles in recent memory. The women surely steal the whole show. Though Meryl's acting has kind of become repetitive. The way she acted in this movie is the same way in which she acted in Iron Lady and Julie & Julia. Julianne Nicholson and Julia Roberts hold down the fort pretty well with commendable inputs from Ewan McGregor, Dermot Mulroney, Benedict Cumberbatch, Abigail Breslin and Chris Cooper. Would've loved to see more of them. The background score gives a warm feeling to the movie. If you want to see this movie watch it for the crazy family that the Westons are. The personal insecurities residing in every person are highlighted in this piece of art. This movie brought out all the emotions inside of me. You should watch this movie for its family theme.

Meryl Streep does a phenomenal job portraying this role.What I love most about this movie is how you see the realism of the trickle-down effect that abuse has. Both the women in my life I know like this had very physically abusive parents so they struggle every day to not do that to their own children, but can't quit the tradition of verbal and emotional abuse. The effects of that trickle down to their children in varied ways that I feel are well-represented by Barb (Julia Roberts), Karen (Juliette Lewis), & Ivy (Julianne Nicholson).I think this movie would be hard to watch for the children or spouse of someone like Vi, but for someone from a more outside perspective, it is a must because of how realistic of a job they manage to pull off. I think if you don't know anyone like this, you should try to watch with an open mind & with the realization that people like this actually are out there, they just hide away in their homes with their issues away from the rest of the world.",August - Osage County
229,Jimtoday,Stagey adaptation of Broadway play cannot find film-appropriate tone.,3,26 December 2013,"The movie is a total disaster! Roberts in is WAY over her head, and it seems as if her upper lip takes focus in every scene she's in, which is a lot. I don't think she's any good, but it's not her fault here, it's a lack of direction, and she is the focus of the whole film, so she has been poorly served. Streep is working so hard to make something BIG and IMPORTANT of her role, she fills it with mannered tics, and grunts and bizarre behavior. In the end it's just desperate. The last time I saw an actress working that hard, she was on a capsized ocean liner on New Year's Eve, swimming underwater lifting a door off of someone!The tone of the movie is erratic, the scenes all call out ""Important Table Scene"", ""Important Veranda Scene"", ""Setting Up Secret You'll Find Out Later Scene"", and so forth. The tone pitches from melodrama to attempts at bleak comedy very unsuccessfully. It's easy to tell which scene must have KILLED on-stage, as it is practically in parenthesis, but it comes off as disturbing, shrill and phony, when it should be tragically hilarious. I felt sorry for the actors in it. Two British actors including the perennially charisma-free Ewan MacGregor play typical Americans (poorly), and the scenery chewing in general would have made Geraldine Page blush! It's the director's fault. The whole thing plays like a parody of ""Cat On a Hot Tin Roof""....and not in a good way.

This adaptation of an award-winning play had its brilliant and terrible moments. Most everybody who's reading this review knows what it's about and how it unfolded, and will understand that it is not for those who want to be reminded of their own abusive parents. For those who can look at it objectively, it's a painful expose' of the lives of too many Americans who have suffered from a cruel, dysfunctional parent. This was a great cast of strong and deeply flawed female characters and weak men. There were two scenes, however, that bothered me greatly and made me want to get up and walk out. SPOILERS/ / / / The first one was brilliant and dreadful. Violet tells her daughter of a joke played on her by her sadistic mother. She badly wants a pair of cowboy boots so she can win the heart of a boy she had a crush on in grade school. She made a big deal of it--I'm speaking to the choir here- -and her mother led her to believe she was getting them for Christmas. Beautifully wrapped, heralded with smiles and winks, the opened package is a worn-out pair of workman's boots caked in mud and excrement. Sad to say, there are too many people in our world who find that kind of thing funny. Violet describes her mother laughing for weeks. Karen, the glitzy, girlie sister, misses the point entirely by asking her mother if she ever got her cowboy boots (you see her priorities, her obliviousness), which wins her a huge eye-roll from Barbara (Roberts). Barbara seems to suffer the most because of her intelligence and her fear that she has inherited her mother's rage disorder. Nauseating, but a shrewd psychological moment.The second episode just made me want to cry, and it's the scenario between Ivy and Little Charles--first cousins who almost escaped, and were keeping their gentle love-affair secret. I just knew that when he sat down to play her his mediocre but tender little love song (in the living room where nobody has any privacy least of all them who are constantly watched), that his mother would come in and interrupt it with her sarcasm. Love is hard enough to find and it hangs like a thin little spider thread when it's starting out, when the lovers are shy, inexperienced, lovelorn. There may have been no substantial physical violence in this film but the emotional violence was real and brutal. More Spoilers--THEN: when we discover that he's her half-brother (an affair between Ivy's father and Charles' mother) and Violet can't wait to bring out the corpse from the closet, it felt to me like those movies where they abuse the wounded dog. I've walked out of movies where they kick or kill the innocent, wounded dog. Innocence was trampled on in this film almost gleefully. Go write a thoughtful review of whether or not this film, this play, adds anything to the world of art except a reminder of abject misery and cruelty. The tacked on suggestion of emancipation for Barbara was not in the original play. Violet was merely abandoned in the dark.",August - Osage County

234,heidistandell,Excruciating!,2,10 January 2014,"I really wanted to like this film. The premise, the actors, the fact that it centers on a family of real grown ups (not 50 somethings playing 30 somethings with teenagers who are 20 somethings). I was looking forward to watching an American film in which the actors play their ages (it seems of late that when an American movie requires grandparents who actually look like grandparents and NOT the evil browed botox caricatures Hollywood passes off as grandparents they have to fly in British actors whose attempts at American accents sounds as if they have a flute up their nose) and WHAT ACTORS: Julia Roberts, Meryl Streep, Juliette Lewis, Ewan McGregor et al. From the promos it seemed the film would deal with real issues. Well, this film does have issues, all right. Buckets, wheelbarrows, truckloads of issues. There were so many issues I thought I had gotten lost on Erskine Caldwell's Tobacco Road, but without the realism -- this was the same white trash but living in a bigger house, and had they been living in a hovel this film would have been attacked as classist in the extreme. Incest (suggested), infidelity, addiction, alcoholism, racism, manipulation, bullying, greed, lying, stealing. It was so hard to find any redeeming quality in any of the characters that it was hard deciding who to hate or who to blame. The mom, Meryl Streep, might make a good scapegoat/punching bag for all the family's problems, but her ho of a sister (or sister in law, I forget and who cares) is no better, and neither are her kids. They go on and on and on and on about their junkie mom but have they ever really tried to help her? And moan about their poor, poor dad, the drunk, as if the fact that he doesn't need a prescription filled to get his mojo and no one in the family ever brings his scotch consumption up since he's such a great guy because he's never been to rehab makes him some kind of saint for sticking by his pill popping wife! One of the daughters wants to marry her cousin, which is creepy enough but when she finds out from her mom that he is her half brother (without the mom knowing she had the hots for him in the first place) she blames the mother for, for, for, WHAT EXACTLY? For never telling them their dear old dad was such a dog and was for years screwing their nice Aunt Mattie? The daughters all play ""who's the bigger martyr"" although they really don't seem to give a damn about anyone but themselves. Even when Julia Roberts has had enough at a family dinner, freaks out at her mom then flushes all her mom's pills down the toilet, exactly who is she doing this for? If her mother's pill addiction is as bad as they make out, wouldn't abruptly stopping the pills put her into intensive care? There really was no one in the film that was worth caring about, or rooting for, or even mourning. In terms of acting, well, it would be impossible to not over-act with such scenarios and such a script, and the actors in this film do not let us down in that regard. The mom's ability to talk non stop for 20 minute intervals without taking a breath while suffering from MOUTH CANCER(!!) and puffing a cigarette at the same time is admirable, and reminds me somewhat of King Lear's hefty dramatic monologues but with a lot of smoke. So if you want to see one of modern cinema's greatest actors (Streep) pull that off, I suppose it's worth the price of admission. And even though he was a lying philandering drunk, ultimately the dad really isn't so bad. He had the sense to off himself at the start of the film, which I was itching to do to myself half way through!",August - Osage County
235,IainMcDougall3,Dysfuctional all star cast comes up trumps,7,11 February 2014,"""August: Osage County"" is a character driven picture with stand-out performances by all the female actors.This movie charts the trials & tribulations of the Weston family from the plains of Osage County Oklahoma. Meryl Streep will rightly receive all the plaudits for another memorable performance but the three daughters played by Julia Roberts (Barbara), Julianne Nicholson (Ivy) and Juliette Lewis (Karen) were amazing. Julia Roberts' best performance since 'Brockovich', Julianne & Juliette were outstanding in their understated support of the two lead women.This movie is both enjoyable & difficult to watch. I defy anyone, watching the funeral dinner scene, not to identify one of these characters from their own family. This film has everything, suicide, incest, infidelity, drug abuse, alcoholism...what more do you want.It was a shame that's Streep's character (Violet) disappeared half way through the film only to emerge near the end. Brits Ewan McGregor & Benedict Cumberbatch have bit parts in this stellar ensemble. I particularly enjoyed the performance of Chris Cooper and his interaction with Margo Martindale. The scene when Cooper has had enough of his wife's criticism of her son is a tear jerker. Finally, writer Tracy Letts must be nominated for screenplay and Adriano Goldman for cinematography.",August - Osage County
236,sberg-7,A vivid story of family dysfunction,9,12 April 2014,"The movie depicts the power of family secrets, the dependence in our society on substances to manage emotional attachment issues, and the medical system's willingness to keep prescribing. In one scene, Barbara is meeting with Violet's doctor and throws the empty pill bottles at him and promises a law suit. In another, Violet recounts the story of the Christmas that she wanted cowboy boots and her mother wrapped up a pair of old, dirty worn-out work boots, and then laughed for days at her disappointment. The fact that it's the native housekeeper who maintains what order there is provides a striking counterpoint to our culture's dominant narrative about natives. The line where Violet pooh-poohs the idea that Johnna is native (""She's no more native than I am"") is a depiction of the ignorance of general European society about our native neighbours.",August - Osage County
237,ingbru2,"Great cast, big disappointment",4,31 January 2014,"The film deals with a difficult family situation brought about by the death of the patriarch. The fine cast assembles as in the stage play to sort out different problems, some very long-standing. I regretted that so many of the arguments were laced with four-letter invectives and that only one of the family members (by marriage) showed respect and dignity when speaking with different family members. The women in the family bullied and belittled each other as though they were still sorting out adolescent grievances.Surely, many families suffer the trauma of loss, but in this film the family matriarch wears her resentments openly and spitefully stirs up old tensions among her daughters to a degree that seems senseless. The men in the family seem to be too passive and willing to obey the matriarch as though she held a special power over them. This is evident in the scene where the matriarch tells the men to put their suit jackets back on at the dinner table in the hot August heat. They all comply like Sunday School pupils. Meanwhile she continues her spiteful comments. The film dragged in certain parts. There were loose ends that were never resolved. There might have been more ""back story"" to fill the audience in on the origins of some of the tensions. In the end family members parted with tensions still festering and without really resolving their misunderstandings. We found the film a waste of time.",August - Osage County

239,tba-822-824730,Who Do We Imagine as Family?,8,26 January 2014,"When we think of family, we rely upon our own experiences to help map out a character description of everyone involved. From our elders to the youngest grandchild, everyone contributes, everyone reacts, everyone delves their personality from one another over the course of their lives. I remember when I was 12 watching my family grieve over the loss of a family member, looking into one another's eyes and wondering what might be in their heads at that precise moment - grief, desire, ambition, any number of immediate emotions. Years later, I experience the aging of our family and observe a matriarchal society.In August: Osage County, Meryl Streep is that matriarch that designs the lives of everyone in an ironic family gathering. Her spirit and passion are a driving force as she has submitted to a life of distance and departure from anyone directly involved in her well-being, and throughout the film, we may recognize our own family patterns, but for some that is where the immediate comparisons might hopefully stop.What happens throughout this movie is disturbing and unfulfilling. With every newly introduced character, every family member returning home, every exploit revealed in quiet conversation, we see what we have all described in our own family - the elephant in the room, the dysfunction we would all try to pretend away. However you may trust in the fact that this family may hopefully be unlike your own.What is more important as the movie goer, is to perhaps recognize the superb performances. Along with Streep who is reckoning another Oscar, Julia Roberts certainly creates her most complete character to date. She is biting, forceful, introspective, and sadly torn throughout the film. In addition, Sam Shepard may very well play himself, and does so with delightful irony.I walked away from this film wondering, thinking about my family, and hoping to find something of redeeming value when I walked out of the theatre. I hugged my wife as we walked to the car. That felt pretty good.http://thinkingoutloud.wordpress.com",August - Osage County
240,lc023,I really wanted to like it...,3,29 April 2014,"This movie is apparently based on a play by Tracy Letts, who also did the screenplay. My question to him now is: What's the point? Was he trying to recreate The Crucible or a Shakespearean tragedy, where the ending just flops? Or in the middle of writing this, did he decide that this family was so dysfunctional beyond help, that he would just throw in the towel, give up and end the story right there? Because that's what this movie felt like: Everything was such a mess that there was no point in trying to clean it up, so he just ended the story. The story begins with Beverly and Violet Weston, a dysfunctional married couple, where the husband is a drunk and the wife Violet (Meryl Streep) is a pill-popping junkie who suffers from mouth cancer. One can understand that Violet's condition and medication may be the cause of her being such a hateful, spiteful and bitter woman with nothing nice to say to anyone, but I think the story overplayed that a bit and used it as a crutch for why Violet was such a bitch. One day Beverly (Shepard) goes out into his boat and doesn't come back. I'm not sure how he died, and there was nothing in the film that showed him committing suicide, being murdered, etc. When Violet realizes her husband is missing, she calls her 3 estranged daughters (Julia Roberts, Juliette Lewis and Julianne Nicholson) to offer her comfort and help. The three daughters are dysfunctional themselves in their own unique ways, which makes this movie even more excruciating. It makes the audience think ""What the hell is wrong with this family? Did the gene pool decide to just sh** on them here??"" The sheriff appears and delivers the bad news, and from there, chaos ensues. None of the characters are like able and none of them can be sympathized with, which what I learned in Creative Writing is an important part of a story. The protagonist(s) does not have to be like able, but does need a circumstance to be sympathized with, which is what I felt this story failed at. Every bad thing that happened to each of the characters, I felt they deserved it for being such awful, hateful human beings. Julia Roberts played the eldest daughter Barbara. Barbara was to me, the most insufferable of all the characters (but there were many close seconds). I couldn't understand what this woman's problem was, she came across just so angry, bitter, uptight and sharp-tongued. I completely understood why her sisters, husband and daughter hated her guts! Who wouldn't completely detest this woman? And the scene where she lost her temper at the dinner table and acted snarky to the doctor, all I could do was shake my head that a grown-a** woman was behaving in such a manner. At the end when she asked her husband if he would come back to her and he told her ""probably not"" and that he was taking their daughter with him, all I could think was ""serves you right, bitch."" Juliette Lewis plays Karen, the middle sister. Although to me she came across as ditsy, flighty, shallow and a bit immature, I did not actually hate her character. I just felt she was a product of a dysfunctional family, who was starved for at least one person to treat her the way a woman should be treated. I did think she was stupid for still running off with her fiancé, even after he gave her 14-year old niece pot, and tried to fool around with her. It did make me think ""what's wrong with you woman? Is your extravagant honeymoon all you care about, and not that your future husband is a pothead perv with an apparent wandering eye?""Ivy, the youngest sister was played by Julianne Nicholson. SHE had a relationship with her first-cousin, (turning out to be half-brother) which to me was disgusting. I don't care if you had a hysterectomy and offspring are out of the question, you're sleeping with a man who is RELATED CLOSELY to you! It's already wrong if you're a distant cousin, but this man is your FIRST DAMN COUSIN/HALF BROTHER. And when she finds out about his fraternal status in relation to her, she blames Barbara and their mother? How is that either of their faults? Wrapping this up, if you're into watching drama and a bunch of dysfunctional individuals tear each other apart, then this movie is for you. As aforementioned, it's the only thing this movie has going for it, as a narrative, it does not. I admit, it sure did a good job of building up to a prospective resolution (the viewer may assume that each character comes to their senses and everything patches up to be rosy) but the ending proves to be a disappointment, and just makes the viewer feel as if Tracy Letts decided that he was too lazy to try and create a resolution, and just gave up on the story",August - Osage County

244,fayadan,Revival of a Masterpiece,9,16 March 2014,"A great drama film with a bunch of talented actors. Just everyone fits in their roles. Meryl Streep has got the lovely moderated theatricality that defines those who bring cinematic rendering of theater plays to completion, reminding me of the mastery of Vivian Leigh at realizing Blanche of A Streetcar Named Desire and of Elizabeth Taylor at capturing Martha of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf.Julia Roberts is really wonderful. Look at the long scene of the family lunch with the well plotted dramatic development culminating in the ravishingly natural Roberts' angry jumping over her mother/ Meryl Streep. This is what I call finesse.Chris Cooper is a fine example of genius with his overwhelming performance through a limited role. He reminds me only of himself as the homosexual overprotective father in American Beauty.Benedict Cumberbatch is also noteworthy with his ability to give flesh to that awkward son flowing with negative emotions. I liked the guy indeed!Individual shots are great most of the time. Beautifully carved cadres.Finally, I find the plot reminiscent of William Faulkner's The Sound And The Fury. The family about to utterly fall, the young man of the limited capabilities (Little Charles) versus the mentally retarded Benjy of Faulkner's masterpiece, both epitomizing the probably divine punishment of a family with deranged Christian morals, and even the sympathetic Black servant and caregiver who takes Benjy there in her refuge is revived here in the Native American servant/ Cook who offers the fallen protagonist Violet/ Streep the last obvious token of sympathy by the end of the film, plus her heroic defense of the little Jean. I don't know if the playwright/ screenwriter Tracy Letts was influenced by Faulkner, but who can escape the great Faulkner anyhow?!It's an excellent movie, and worth watching.",August - Osage County

Every bit of dialogue and storyline is powerful and emotionally stirring, superseding all other dark drama I have seen in my life. Although it seems like this family has been through every possible negative thing in life, it still doesn't outwardly present itself that way. The dark tones of the film haunt you for days, even months after watching it and I still think of this movie fairly often. (Though I have watched it several times) The casting and acting is top notch, with Streeps performance leaving me speechless, it is closely followed by Cumberbatch and Roberts.

246,Pankakesnotstellar,A fine piece of acting and storytelling,8,21 January 2014,"I really liked this film! Just saw it now and precipitated to write my first review. The casting is superb and the storytelling very moving and realistic. The cinematography is kept simple but refreshing and it allows for a bit of breath when it is dearly needed. The story offers us an eye blink into one family that gathers for a funeral and as it is often the case this escalates in to so much more. There is a lot of drama material that the members of this family have to go through and the perfect angle of approach for me in the storytelling is that it is not in any case spoon fed to the viewer. Instead, you can catch glimpses of its magnitude in the excellent dialogues and the portrayal of the characters. Julia Roberts and Julianne Nicholson are simply sublime in their roles respectively as the eldest daughter and the youngest one of the terrifying Meryl Streep, whose character is the only one I found a bit too straightforward.Meryl's character together with her sister's have had a particularly awful childhood. They are literally violence bred from violence. It is especially clear in Meryl's case that she does not posses 1 gram of motherly love. Both of them torture their kids in their own way and the results are devastating for all. The dead man they are trying to honour has had his share of guilt,his not being alive permits the drama to take a clear and liberating form for all the other family members. Now they can finally talk about what has been going on and how their deconstructed structure of a family came to be. It is certainly not a feel-good movie, nor it is meant to be a dark comedy. It stands fully as a pure dark drama with a few moments of love relief. Indeed if I'm rooting for at least 2 persons to get out of there unscathed is the 2 lovers who deserve and need it the most. One unnecessary twist on my opinion, was the complication of an already very difficult love, I found it hard to understand what would that add to the story or any character in anyway.There is a very particular and strong scene at table for lunch that would have lost nothing if it didn't involve the last twist, a bit over the top and contrives the story in being too much for its own good. A few of the reviews complained about the very bad language, honestly expecting clean speech in that level of drama coupled with THAT level of aggressiveness and misery is tantamount ridiculous and fake. The film is perfectly done, take a ride into Dante's hell and surge clean and ready to cherish what is best in your own family, however dysfunctional.

If you enjoy watching a family tear each other apart with profanity and gossip, with no purpose and no humility, this is great theater (it looks like a remake of 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf' on steroids-not a pleasant experience either). This may be more entertaining as a stage play, although I can't imagine an extra hour. These people are looking at 'dysfunctional' in the rear view mirror.

To say the least, this reminds oneself that movie acting can be a deemed a true art form. To start with, the script is tight, albeit classical story-telling, nicely pieced up for the big screen. But that's not always sufficient - you need a balanced cast to deliver the goods. Watching the dinner scene reminded me of such classics as ""Twelve angry men"" and ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" - all cast members pulling in just the right weight in accordance with their role's importance. A bit of name-dropping now: Chris Cooper, offering a deft performance as the family by- default mediator, is a gem. Julia Roberts, almost like a reprised Erin Brockovich, gives a commending performance considering she's in front of - well - you know who. And then there's you-know-who; OK so it's cute when others actors at award shows joke about how good she is but when push comes to shove, you've got to bow... she's stupendously good!

I think the trailer somewhat differs a little from the overall story, but then again, it is always good to see which choices Meryl Streep makes. If you are a theater lover and know the play or somehow work in the industry, this might be very interesting.

The movie takes its time and really doesn't throw much at you. The beauty of the film comes in the writing and the performances. The conversations feel so natural and genuine that occasionally it feels like thanksgiving at my house. Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts each received high praise ( for good reason both are tremendous), however I think the unsung hero of the movie is Chris cooper. He is so amazing in every scene he's in. He is probably the only character with any real redeemable qualities. However each character gets at least one scene all to the self to leave their stamp on their characters and they all do.

This is the kind of movie you watch and then feel bad when its over. Also, I found the characters to be pretty two-dimensional; we learn that they all came from screwed up backgrounds, but we don't really get to experience the happier side of them or see a snapshot of brighter times from the past.

258,david_duval_tulsa,Not Osage County,1,15 March 2015,"I don't even know where to start with the deplorable inaccuracies of this movie. First of all, there's no distinction between ""white"" people and Native Americans in Osage County. Every Osage County family has Native American linage. Immediately in this film characters make some sort of artificial, contrived reference to racism. Easy emotional button, I'm sure, for an amateur writer but simply not realistic. Not because we're some kind of extraordinary people, but simply because we all have Native American relatives. It's simple; Osage girls are beautiful. Every Osage County white family had some boy in the last 100 years fall in love with a beautiful Osage girl. Typical Hollywood stereotyping suggest some sort of total segregation that couldn't be further from the truth. We grew up here, all good friends. If we had grievances with each other it was usually based on actual actions or words said, real events, not because some one was Native American. It's so funny because if someone in Oklahoma didn't like Native Americans, what the hell would they do? There are Native Americans EVERYWHERE. In Oklahoma, like everywhere, we call this lie Hollywood is portraying total bull&*^%. Personally, I'm too old to be offended, though. This kind of thing happens in movies all the time. I'm just disappointed that I can't find a good movie to watch. As the movie progressed, I realized that I have never, ever known people who talked or acted like the characters in this film. That's fine if it's just some weird movie about a bizarre family. But it's not. It's title implies it's somehow a characterization of the people of this part of Oklahoma. Through my 51 years of life I have known people of all walks of life from my educated parents to the construction crew I worked on for a home builder when I was in high school. All of the problems families face existed here, just like anywhere. But, I don't recall ever experiencing people that behaved in that kind of hideous manner. Once again, Hollywood has simplified a complex demographic to the point of utter meaninglessness. Oklahoma is a crossroads. No one is ""from here"". Even the Native Americans aren't from here. Very, very few are. Most were marched here from states East of Oklahoma that wanted to be rid of the Natives. About half died along the way. And the European immigrants who came here are actually the first European migrants that actually lived with the Native Americans and now, about 115 years later, we are of them, a part of them, they are apart of us, there is no us and them. Our cultures are interlaced. One does not exist without the other here. You don't learn these things by driving through. This movie should have a different title and not even reference anywhere. In my adult life, I have lived in Tulsa and worked for many years for an Engineering company that employs people from all over the world. I don't know anyone from any culture that behaves in this manner. This movie must be the product of some bizarre culture that exists in Hollywood that fabricates self righteous scenarios falsely based on some delusion that other people from other places are hideous, stupid, horrible degenerates. That's a tough row to hoe, because most people from everywhere are generally good.

It serves as an homage to Chekov perhaps in many ways, that is to say that you have what seems and is a representation of a middle class family. Here's the struggle of life in what is known as a place where struggle is no stranger. Formerly the ""Dust Bowl"" sets as a backdrop to more filth and foul than most moviegoers care for. To want and long for better is their calling card, as evidenced by all the expensive ""$#5^&"" about the living room. Whilst there may be valuable things about the living room, there exists no value in the way characters relate with one another. Many of us have seen the ills that drug addiction, alcoholism, and family dysfunction have wraught upon our heartland, and none of us deem it worthy of glory. A movie like this serves to normalize and in some ways validate the very grotesque conduct which our society hopes to avoid. I do not question the fact that this film has some value. While these unfortunate behaviours are prevalent in the movie, maybe they are a true reality. And, just maybe they shed light on what could very well be considered something unthinkable. That is to say that perhaps our mothers and daughters engage in hurtful, mean-spirited talk like that of the characters in this film. If that is the case, then I do not wish to continue on living in such a putrid setting. Thank you Mrs. Streep and Roberts for bringing my own sense of morality into a clearer focus.",August - Osage County
260,pati-bhy,Your family can't be worst than that (Spoilers),7,24 February 2014,"I thought I had a complicate family until I saw that movie. I could relate to almost all the characters story lines until the half of movie where things got worst and I started to think that my family may be not so complicate as I thought. The story lines are rough, if you are expecting a happy ending from this misery you will be disappointed. If you are expecting a closure to all the characters problems, you also will be disappointed. Meryl Streep gave a solid performance that smells Oscar all over it, but that is not a surprise. I was surprise by Julia Roberts acting, she really got into the character and hold all the emotional moments well without overacting. If there was a weak link it passed unnoticed since I thought that every actor on it gave enough of what the movie asked for. I thought that the movie was well acted and written. Whatever the only complains that I see (and as I didn't see the play I can't speak for it) is that the comedy part was left aside, what I can agree since it may be the most dramatic movie that I have ever seen. There were not funny moments in this movie, everything was heavy, everyone looked sad and tired all the time, there were not moments of relief, each minute one new issue came out. And each problem was bigger than the other. Be aware because in this movie you will get verbal abuse from start to end, some physical violence, adultery and even incest. So, I think that you have to be emotional prepared to watch this movie, because at the end it will give you nothing, but frustration and sadness. That's a good movie to watch and feel better about your family since them can't be worst than that.",August - Osage County
261,jessica-c_li,Intelligently put together and everything you would want out of a drama about family.,9,24 January 2015,"I've been planning to watch this movie ever since it was released and I finally got around to it. After seeing it, I wish I hadn't waited so long. This is because August Osage is one of those movies that belittle all your own real-life problems since the lives of the characters in it are just that 'fucked up'. In my mind, that's what movies should be able to do so they definitely succeeded in that sector. This movie is the definition of 'cut the crap'. It's explicitly cruel, raw and disturbing. But to the extent of how relatable this film is, it is almost cringe-worthy because it is so so real. And in my opinion, not at all tacky, cheesy or clichéd. The story, to say the bare minimum, is about family. But the ideas that this film explores in the realm of 'being about family' is rather unique and quite fascinating. For example, it touches on the development of humanity as a whole, represented by one mere family through the generations –showing how as each generation is born, they grow to be smarter and more open- minded. Another couple of things they addressed which I enjoyed pondering over is; the reaction from the older generations in response to this development throughout the generations and also the somewhat toxic social conventions that surround the idea of family and how each character is individually and uniquely affected by them. Perhaps the reason why I steered away from seeing this movie for so long was that my previous experiences with similar movies –that have such an intricate web of characters is that between all the chaos, it is almost intimidating and overwhelming for the viewer, to have so much information being dumped on them, being expected to absorb it all and be able to identify and relate to so many characters in such a short period of time but thankfully, August Osage does it seamlessly. It is so easy to follow, it almost feels welcoming and the number of characters is not at all burdensome. They introduce each character at 'convenient' spots in the film and give the viewer time before jumping into their tragic back stories.As you know, the cast is star studded, plenty of familiar faces from Meryl Streep, Julia Roberts, Ewan McGregor, Abigail Breslin, Benedict Cumberbatch, Julianne Nicholson and more. The characters that Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts portray and how they portray them is astounding and summarizes all the reasons for their success. Although, through detailed inspection, a couple characters may come off slightly bland, however the unpredictable sequence of events and plot twists, almost force them to become interesting.Visually, this movie is incredibly pleasant to watch in a strangely modest way. Wells didn't go out of his way to impress the viewer aesthetically but in between all the drama, we catch glimpses of a beautiful, peaceful countryside which is quite the juxtaposition to what actually goes on in the film. A nice change for a Baz Luhrmann lover. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.Follow reviewthemovie on Instagram for more!",August - Osage County
262,soulotus-950-427973,Incredible,9,17 March 2014,"I think August: Osage County is absolutely admirable for two things: First, the fact that Tracy Letts created a screenplay that felt incredibly authentic and close to real life. Every character was written in such depth that when I finished the movie I was sure that this was an autobiographical piece. The way in which Letts managed to create such strong-willed female characters without falling into the trap of turning them into one dimensional villains was spectacular. In my opinion, the dialogue between each and everyone was not only smart but it captured a brutality that only real life holds.Secondly, of course: the acting. It is impossible to find flaws in Streep's performance, and though I am not a big fan of Roberts' work she was great in this movie. But for me, the best performance belonged to Julianne Nicholson and her strong, silent and thoroughly convincing performance of Ivy.All in all, a dark and beautiful movie.",August - Osage County

That being said, if you come from a broken family, had a rough childhood or just a crazy family in general this film may relate and draw you in. Some good things, a lot of bad things but a great movie overall. The cast is great, the acting is great and if the camera left the house more than twice I'd give it a higher rating but I understand why most all of it took place there as that's where everyone's past originated from. 2 hours of chaos from mild to wild. Sam Shepherd is good in it as well but the crazy act that Julia Roberts puts on is priceless. Loved the native American care giver. She loves shovels. Enjoy!",August - Osage County

It has a touch of King Lier play and it has a touch of the theater in its context especially that there is almost one location for all the movie and some scenes go as long as 15 minutes . Yet, it is not boring at all The make up is remarkable and there is an indulging competition in acting. It has been a while since I have seen a super performance from all the actors in a single movie like this Julia Roberts is amazing, this performance is not any less than her awarded role in Erine Bronkovich. Meryl Streep is just phenomenal in this role. She is amazing to say the least There are no nudity or sexual scenes but there is a very strong language and lots of profanity if you want to watch with the minors It is a must see",August - Osage County

266,gitoutover,Worst Movie I've Ever Seen,1,14 January 2017,I can just picture the faces of the actors as they envisioned receiving what must have seemed like inevitable Oscars for their performances in this movie. I wonder if they could picture the faces of their audience subjected to what became nothing more than an unforgivable assault on their senses. On no level are the characters in Osage County worthy of the time or money it cost to see this film. I've enjoyed many a dark movie as well as great performances by the actors in Osage County and yet I was actually angry with myself for suffering through this nonsense to the bitter end.

Movies are about escape, not a reminder what a suck world we live. I think actors took the part just to see how dark they could make their characters. WAY over the top bad. The father was smart killing himself and that poor maid being stuck with that racist woman. This was a Meryl Streep stinker.

270,ramesh-esvee,Intelligent performances delivered in a hot atmosphere,8,26 March 2014,"I felt terrible when Merly Streep was once again nominated for this year's Oscars for best Actress, when the performance of Emma Thompson for 'Saving Mr. Banks' was ignored; but then i hadn't watched this insane and scorching movie. Merly Streep has that command over the character that we have seen over and over again and again, where she just sucks you into her characters head, and make you believe that if you were her(the character), this is exactly what you would find yourselves doing.She is unbelievable as the highly melodramatic mother who is internally dealing with abandonment issues. She has cancer and she is living on pills. The death of her husband brings her three daughters home, where there is a constant fight among the four, about who is responsible of this whole mess.Merly Streep swoops the whole area from her counterparts in all the scenes she makes a nod. She rants continuously about her abandonment, about her daughters lives, and about her husband. I have never seen Meryl so high pitched since 'Mama Mia' . She is bossy and a boastful know-it-all, that she doesn't notice who she hurts in order to make her statements.Julia Roberts as the eldest daughter, has also earned a nomination in the supporting actress list for this years Oscars. She portrays a control-freak, who is on the verge of a divorce from her husband and has no idea how to deal with her disobedient daughter. She tries to come into this house and set straight all the mess made by her mother. Julianne Nicholson and Juliette Lewis are the other two daughters who, like anyone else in this dysfunctional family have a lot going on.The movie is very much a performance based one, based on the dark comedic play by Tracy Letts, who has also written the screenplay for this movie. When you think of this movie with a Merly Streep as its poster girl, we would cease to look any forward for decent performances. But in here, we are shocked to find some excellent scenes where the supporting cast holds its own. With a genius actor in Benedict Cumberbatch who had a relatively easier role in here; but then when you see this on-screen arrogant mad genius play a humble and socially awkward character, you would stand up with a hearty ovation. The other surprise among the cast was Chris Copper and Margo MartinDale. Margo, an amazing actress who is very used to doing supporting roles, kicks in with a one-scene firework, that has her morph from the amiable fat old lady to an angry dark bitchy girl. It was Whoa!! The movie also features Ewan McGregor, Dermot Mulroney and Abigail Breslin.One very amusing part of the movie is that the main plots unfurl in two or three really big scenes, which happens around the dinner table. The characters talk about themselves, and others, and try to clean up their good slates, finding only more and more guilt and pain. The director John Wells, deliberately but yet subtly brings around engaging conversations, as if right out of a play, and delivers some really good moments for you to like about.August Osage county, moves up my list, because of its engaging screenplay and intelligent performers.",August - Osage County

I honestly did not see a character that I really liked or respected. I went mainly to see the performances of some great actors whom I respect very much, but at the point where I wanted to yell at the screen and tell the characters to go home and let the movie end, I decided to leave myself.

This dysfunctional family is made up of characters everyone can relate to, and they have issues most families have to deal with at some point or other. They also harbour secrets which, when being addressed, make viewing riveting. Chris Cooper, and Margo Martindale as the uncle and aunt offer up some comic relief, and Juliane Nicholson does brilliantly at playing the lesser popular sister, with Juliette Lewis admirably taking on a character you would not usually associate her with.If, like me, you prefer dialogue driven films, which really show off the skill of an actor/actress then you'll find this film a joy from start to finish.

They seem like it's trying to be ""artsy."" You don't see the characters, you see the actors, unfortunately. Would be a lot better with unknowns. The big name actors just take away from the originality and reality of what it may be trying to accomplish. I think the actors were given a script one day and just recited the next day in one take.Excellent cinematography and directing, though. The camera movements are clear. The scene changes are appropriate for the story. Very good directing in the sense that you can see what you're supposed to be trying to see. Focus on each important role was well taken care of.

While I can see how this story would be great on stage in a live performance format, as a movie on screen, for me, it's too melodramatic. It seemed almost like a parody of a family drama. The dialogue, performances, and plot-turns aren't surprising or interesting to me and everything escalates in a predictable way.

277,megdodge,Painful to watch,3,11 January 2014,"I will begin by saying I had high expectations for this movie—who wouldn't with such an incredible cast? But, as sometimes happens when a gaggle of acclaimed actors convene for an Oscar-destined drama, it was incredibly unpleasant. Centered on a dysfunctional family in the boondocks of Oklahoma, August: Osage County cannot be faulted for lack of honesty. The plot piles on heap after heap of horrific familial revelations, everything from a sister and brother engaging in an incestuous relationship to a fourteen-year-old smoking pot with and kissing a 50-year-old man who also happens to be her aunt's fiancé. Nearly every character, especially those of Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts, is extremely unlikable, selfish, and antagonistic; the post-funeral dinner scene in which Meryl Streep's character systematically offends and curses at each member of the family is so unsettling and drawn out that I had to leave the room mid-way through. Every family has at least one member with a similarly over-dramatic and aggressive personality and many families have equally sad and unfortunate problems, so in that respect August: Osage County is a fair and candid representation of family life. But with that being said, the sheer number of conflicts presented is gratuitous. It makes a mockery of the hardships real families face every day, sensationalizing them to the same caliber as the Jerry Springer Show. Every fight, every divulgement of secrets is so exaggerated that I could not keep myself from laughing at the outrageousness—Julia Roberts' inane cursing rant about fish had me alternating between incredulous laughing and appalled discomfort. Of course, the acting is phenomenal on all counts (how else did I come to despise the characters so vividly?), but quality acting can only carry a film so far. The plot, the story of a disturbed family of narcissistic, morally unsound people leaves so much to be desired. I am thoroughly unsatisfied, a little frustrated, and so grateful that my family is not like that.",August - Osage County

Tragedy struck and the dad leaves home and gone missing for days. The family gets home together and find their dad drowned himself.This is is the first film I saw at TIFF 2013.

The lines a bit to harsh and vulgar but the script you must say is stunning upon delivery.Every now and then as I was seating in a full theater with the audience remarkable delight reactions on every part enjoying the film I always see it as a drama in the Tagalog/ Filipino movie industry. It was so overdone that a soap opera would out run its bags of tricks. The drama is perfect for screaming lines, confrontations and oh no that just didn't happen kind of things. But, adapting this to a Filipino film would work sans the drug problem.But this is a family drama, and worth the acting stunts pulled by Streep, Roberts, Lewis and Cumberbatch even the support would bag them an ensemble SAG all better than a remake or upgraded Steel Magnolias.

Nevertheless, concerning the awards, I was correct, checking into reviews etc regarding this movie, I see the word award attached to it at every turn. Sadly and unbelievably predictable. What a disappointment! This film was billed as a comedy but aside from a few and forced awkward laughs in response to awkward moments, there was nothing fun or funny about this movie. The only plot I could find in this episodic over-dramatic and poorly staged soap opera was the plot to rope people into see it using a star-filled cast and the promise of laughs. Synonyms for this movie include (but are not limited to): superficial, contrived, bleak, unbelievable, regrettable, gratuitous, insulting, unmemorable , depressing, and rip-off.

The writing, in short, is horrid. It seems like an exercise for a sophomore playwriting 101 class at NYU rather than a Hollywood feature film. Sadly, garbage like this has become the norm in movies, but how it ever got to Broadway is beyond me. The plot consists of three sisters attending their father's funeral and their interaction with the family matriarch, whose drug induced rages are neither funny nor poignant. Ostensibly, the movie unravels furtive family secrets, but unfortunately no one really cares about this family or their inner strife. There is not point to this painful madness other than for Hollywood A-listers to masturbate over themselves and for producers to make a quick buck.

289,gaitoms,The Glass Osagerie,9,28 January 2014,"The scenery / frames grabbed my soul, the acting grabbed my attention, Streep's raven black presence made made me sh^+ my pants, while at the same time... comic timing made laugh out loud!Not a great fan of Ewan McGregor's acting... but in the depths of this movie, I didn't even notice it was him! Great return to form for Julia Roberts and Meryl Streep... well, if she doesn't win an award somebody's brain at Oscars HQ needs to be examined! All actors gave a stunning performance, but... I'm afraid Benedict Cumberbatch's accent was not executed well enough, there were hints of typical Englishness all through his lines... if this was not so, I'd probably give 10/10.I'm a sucker for symbolism, and oh boy... I loved it in this whether they were on purpose or me just making them up in my own cinematic mind. E.g the telegraph / electrical poles scattered across the landscape like industrial Christian crosses taking over the native American land - power v spirituality, progress v faith... oppression v innocence etc. Also, when Barbara's daughter left in the car... she puts her shades on, subtly suggesting that this vicious streak continues through their bloodline. But, the more powerful of them all was at the end, after Barbara left... Violet ran upstairs in need of comfort, she lay down in the arms of Johnna (the native American housekeeper) who's culture has been constantly mocked by Violet throughout the film... but she (Violet) knows deep in her heart the she is the oppressor... and gives in. Gives in to whom? To America, the spirit, the land... mother earth.Brilliant film, classically American movie with typical Tennessee Williams references. And great, great acting. Gobsmackingly twisted, shocking, funny, sad and spiritual. 9/10!",August - Osage County

Dysfunctional, divided loyalties, broken spirits and all the rest of the characteristics that remain true to life. I appreciated that the director/producer(s) honored the fact that this film originated as a stage play. Except for the few brief scenes in the area surrounding the house and the images of the local community (all of which were appropriately necessary) the settings for each scene closely resembled those you might expect to find in a stage play.

I wish I'd considered more carefully before choosing it.Is there a positive outcome for a single one of the characters? If so, I missed it.I went hoping this movie might reverse my less-than-impressed opinion of Meryl Streep.

The storyline is intense and it is as if you are there. The characters have so much depth and intensity. One of the many things I loved about this film is you will be on a roller coaster ride the entire way and never be let down. This was one of the most interesting movies I can remember. It reminds me of ordinary people in some ways, but much more dramatic. The acting is incredible, the screenplay flawless, and the visceral intensity is second the very few.

Two things come to mind... If you are a student of the Arts, interested in acting, lighting, writing, roles, etc, watch this movie. If, like me, you watch movies simply to be entertained, then do NOT watch this movie. As Blanche says, ""It's exhausting, it's full of really despicable people, and it's mighty depressing."" It's also boring. If you didn't like Lost in Translation, and, Little Miss Sunshine, then you will not like this either. Surely a movie is made for the end result, not the parts of the sum.

295,mjtinok,How VERY GOOD it could have been,1,12 April 2014,"Tracy Letts stated that he is sick of the movies in LA and NYC, Oklahoma is ALWAYS dogged as rednecks, and wanted to show that there are people in Oklahoma that are teachers and read books. I couldn't agree with him more. So Tracy writes this incredibly disastrous tale of a family that is in every way a total disaster together, their own separate families, and as individuals.Tracy, it would've been nice for you to show the family come together to help each other out, the daughters help each other become happier/better people by supporting each other, and it end with everyone leaving with a new sense of direction knowing that they are now closer than ever, to help each other move on with their lives.Instead you showed Oklahoma people in a dismal light- drug addicts, alcoholics, and no one able to actually have or get a normal life. Your movie only degraded what we in Oklahoma contenting fight and adds to that stigma.We don't need or want to see this role you set. If you REALLY wanted to show you're born and bred in Oklahoma pride- this definitely wasn't it. As a note- I too was born here and have lived here all my life and there were plenty of things that you could have added to make this a more positive view of a family instead of all of them being messed up.The next time you want to portray Oklahoma- PLEASE DON'T!",August - Osage County
296,stefanie_sybens,Theatricality in August: Osage County,7,27 April 2014,"August: Osage County, a black-comedy film based on Tracy Letts Pulitzer Prize-winning play, is centered around a family filled with a lot of resentment against each other. Violet Weston played by Meryl Streep, nominated for a Golden Globe and an Academy Award, is recently widowed and is the matriarch of the family as well. She is characterized by her drug addiction and violent attitude against her three daughters named Barb (Julia Roberts), Karen (Juliette Lewis) and Ivy (Julianne Nicholson).The setting of the story takes place in Violet's Oklahoma house which gives us a clue concerning the play-like format. However, shooting in one particular location doesn't bother the viewer at all since it is able to build up the suspense. The movie can be linked with Chekov's last play the Cherry Orchard. Both contain dramatic elements yet brought in a humoristic way. Although both stories are centered around a broken family, the Cherry Orchard contains social critique and the announcement of Modernity as well.Everyone in the story shares their grievances and we are privileged to capture the character's individuality. Moreover, bringing all those kinds of personalities together seems to repair the damage. The family in itself has fallen apart towards the end yet in an effort to be able to recover their own individuality in society. The climax of the story can be brought back to Roberts and Streeps fighting scene where the movie is able to bring forward such raw emotions. Streep shows us yet again the magic of her craft and astonishes us with several explicit break-down scenes.To conclude, the theatricality is very much underlined during the movie but it provides us with untouched, real emotions as Stanislavski prescribed it. The cast was exquisite and showed the dynamic of a family how disturbed they all might have been on the surface.",August - Osage County
297,vinny-gloria,from a Christian perspective,7,28 April 2014,"Bewildering is the best word to describe the story presented in the film August: Osage County. The film itself is at no point predictable. It seems to be written from a place of despair and depression. Viewers ought to be forewarned that, while the acting is phenomenal and the story is engaging, this film will leave its audience feeling hopeless. August: Osage County is the epitome of the suffering people face when they are at the mercy of the world and reject the salvation that can be found in Jesus Christ.Simple and beautiful views of Oklahoma highlight the beginning of the film as actor Sam Shepard, playing Beverly Weston, delivers a monologue about life and agreements, like the one he made with his wife. Mrs. Violet Weston (Vi), played by Meryl Streep, is an abrasive, selfish pill junkie. Her husband Bev is a charmingly jaded alcoholic.Drama quickly ensues, with Bev going missing and Vi calling her three daughters to come help. This film, like most productions that director John Wells is connected to, is a heavy drama driven by broken relationships. The Weston daughters all enter the story with their own extensive baggage. Their relationship with Vi is clearly marked by emotional and verbal abuse.Each and every actor and actress in the film has an emotionally charged role and performs very well. Actresses Meryl Streep, Julia Roberts, and Juliette Lewis play complex characters aptly, easily conveying a range of emotions and struggles with their facial expressions alone.The minor character and role of Johnna, a Native American housekeeper hired just before Bev disappears, is a subtle but important element of this film. Played by Misty Upham, Johnna is a quiet woman who serves as a wallflower throughout the film. She quietly watches all that unfolds, deeply personal as all the drama is. Despite Vi's degrading treatment of Johnna, the woman faithfully does her job. Upham's performance in this film is astounding given the nature of the role.Helping the acting along, an incredible mixed soundtrack carries the drama of the performance in such a way that the emotions seen on screen work their way into the audience's minds. Despite the sometimes hurried dialog and overly dramatic composition of the story, the film is engaging. It is also, however, unavoidably disheartening.There is an impressive unity between the story presented in this film and actual production of the film. Every aspect of the film, from the soundtrack to the scenery, ties into the story. This is truly what makes the film worthy of a high rating.Simple themes emerge throughout the film that make viewers feel as the characters seem to: run over, beaten down, and locked into a futile fight. One theme, for instance, is that all people need to do is survive, it doesn't really matter what they do with their lives. Another very prevalent theme is that the truth is poison but it is better spoken. Each character struggles with different truths, but finds that eventually, all truths must be confronted.Unfortunately, the truths that this film remarks on are all depraved ideas that people are messed up, broken, and forever going to live in a state of pain. Rather than asking a question, providing an answer, or exploring a topic, the purpose of this film seems to be to simply portray life as it is, giving the audience something to identify with.The most encompassing message that the film presents is stated by the most undervalued character, Karen. Played by Juliette Lewis, Karen is the most distant daughter of the Weston girls. She lives her life moving from guy to guy, using her beautiful looks, and philosophizing about how dreams can come true. All the while, it is clear that her chosen ignorance is a coping mechanism for all of her pain, especially as her mother is utterly cold and impartial to her existenceexcept for when the opportunity arises to make Karen the butt of a joke. Both Meryl Streep, playing the mother, and Juliette Lewis, her daughter, bring to life the nature of this relationship in an unforgettable manner.As she leaves the family behind in a heated moment, Karen gently but steadily tells her sister, Barb, ""I've done some things I'm not proud ofcause life just puts you in a corner that way."" Accompanying this sentiment, Karen makes a messy and brief case that there is a difference between being blamed, and being blameless.This is where the thesis of the film is mostly strongly pronounced. Essentially, August: Osage County tells viewers that we all come from something, so the fact that we are so messed up means that we aren't to be blamed. Life ""puts you in a corner,"" as it does to everyone. However, none of us is entirely blameless, because like these characters, we choose to take part in much of what we suffer from. The end. There is no hope.That thesis is what the film emulates, in a course manner much like the main character, Vi, who often says she is ""just truth-telling"". Christians who view this film can praise the Lord as it unfolds that the emotions this film asks to identify with are not all that there is. The nebulous, hopeless prayer that these characters pray over dinner together is not the only prayer there is pray...... (see the rest at christiantomatoes)",August - Osage County

300,bluezfool,Draining and tragic,3,7 December 2014,"Note to self and advice to friends: A critical mistake would be to attempt to watch a Meryl Streep movie at a time when you cannot finish it before the man of the house comes in. Men, generally speaking, are not typically fond of dramas, and especially not dramas starring Meryl Streep, such as the awful downer ""Osage County"". If he can stomach sitting there waiting for you to finish it, you will need to develop your tuning out skills, so that you won't hear his foot tapping, his chair rocking, his bag of Cheetohs crinkling, all of the comments about how fake the emotions are, who is gonna cry next, and then his ridiculous mocking attempts to emulate said cries. And that's on top of having to watch the movie in a 6-inch square while he restlessly scrolls through the guide looking for . . . anything to get him out of this jam! Toward the end, he might finally give in and sit quietly, sensing that it's nearing the end, and sure enough, just as you sink into this sad, tragic emotional nightmare of a movie, sitting on the edge of your seat, hoping for something good to happen, waiting for Julia Roberts to get out of the truck and do something . . . emotional . . . he says, ""Oh, Lord, now THIS one is gonna bawl. Will it ever end?"" I might be the only person who ever watched this movie who couldn't breathe at the end from laughing. Moral of the story: Be sure to have Jean Claude Van Damme on the screen when your man walks in, iffen ya wanna earn points.

Characters burst into elaborate speeches about life and their own lives as if on cue, at moments where they should just be reacting to things, and it has sort of a soap-opera quality to it, with family drama for each member of the cast. Maybe the play is better, as it won the Pulitzer Prize. It is well opened up, though, and the dinner scene is good. And Meryl Streep is a very brave actress for undertaking such a role. I don't think many actresses of her caliber would have agreed to such a scene as the one that opens this movie. 6/10 because of the cast and some believable characters.",August - Osage County

I felt like i was watching nearly 2.5 hours of screaming and a Meryl Streep trying way too hard to portray a junkie. Plus, it really look like both Mrs. Streep and Roberts were battling for screen time. Benedict Cumberbach should not accept roles that require him to take on a different accent.

305,zombiewhitegirl-15099,This movie tried really hard to blend the line between right and wrong.,6,20 August 2016,"I've seen this movie about a dozen times, and I've tried for a long time to articulate just what bothers me about it. What I LIKE about it is easy: awkward family scenes are enjoyable to me for some reason. The acting was incredible, as you'd expect from anything Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts. I even like that it examines situational ethics, such as:Would it be excusable to cheat if your wife is a cold, raging b*tch? What about committing suicide to get away from the obligation of taking care of your cantankerous, drug addicted wife? Should first cousins be acceptable as a couple if one or both are sterile?How young is ""too young"" for a man to begin a sexual relationship with a young woman?However, I feel the writers took it too far at times, almost excusing away the character's behavior through dialogue. For example, there's a reason that the dope-smoking daughter is 14- going-on-30; her age is supposed to conflict with her looks and maturity, making us second guess whether we think it was really WRONG of Karen's fiancée to hit on her, especially if she was willing. Karen went into a pathetic rant right before she left with Steve about Jean (the 14 year old) being partially responsible, and how it's a grey area. It's not.Violet belligerently attacked almost everyone at the funeral dinner and when Barb protested, she told her she knew nothing about REAL attacks, citing her terrible childhood. No one really shut her down here and she went on quite a long tirade which always feels to me like the writer was expressing their OWN views here, and I'm sorry, but no matter how rotten your childhood was, it doesn't give you an excuse to treat others like crap. Yet another moment where it felt like they tried to ask the audience, ""Is it okay to behave badly IF...?"" Later, it's revealed that Aunt Mattie Fey had an affair with Beverly, resulting in a Little Charles. She goes into this self- righteous dialogue about how she's ""more than just your fat Aunt Mattie Fae...there's more to me than that."" That, I assume, was supposed to imply that because the situation is more complicated than it may appear, that makes it somehow excusable. Finally, if you weren't uncomfortable enough by the romantic relationship between first cousins, the writer pushes it a step further to test your tolerance: the first cousins are actually half- siblings.The whole movie felt like one ethics test after another, which is fine, except that the writer also inserted their own answers to the tests through their characters, and I completely disagree with ALL of their conclusions.",August - Osage County
306,doraboras,A Gripping Family Melodrama,7,7 February 2017,"Despite myopic and crass reviews that this film faced, I believe that August: Osage Country deserves a chance. Though often criticized for it's tendency to ""over-act,"" I found the dramatic and emotional performances engaging, creating a spectacle out of a thematically typical family melodrama, while keeping true to its roots in the theater. I believe that the restricted setting of the movie worked in its favor - the narrative is driven by energetic and willful female leads, whose lives begin to unravel in the domestic realm - they are challenged by traditional standards of womanhood. These women are constricted by expectations, and this is expressed through the claustrophobic atmosphere of the film. It is no coincidence that this drama is told in a domestic setting, a site familiar to women, associated with homemaking and care-giving, which are typically considered women's tasks. This is not a easily digestible watch, and does not try to be - the mis en scene does nothing to glamorize these women, and make their lives appealing to the audience. It is emotionally exhaustive, ""exaggerated"" and entertaining - the film is punctuated with revelations and confessions that shock the Weston family, and spectators alike.Though Benedict Cumberbatch felt wildly miscast to me, the movie was carried by its performances. Though the female leads may have displaced the male spectator by providing little for them to relate to, I believe this movie's intention is to do this unapologetically. I felt empathetic towards the Weston women, and though much of the dialogue is abusive, Violet Weston makes it clear that the previous generation of Weston women have not had it easy - though this does not justify the verbal abuse, I found the causing factors of their depressed and cyclical behavior to be legible. Though directed and written by two men, the realistic depiction of a troubled matriarchal family may have alienated the male spectator, and the male critic, leading to a disproportionately negative review. ""Osage County"" is worth a chance. Easy to follow, paired with the occasional dark humour and exceptional performances by Streep and Roberts made this movie heart wrenching and provocative. Definitely did not receive the critical reward it deserved.",August - Osage County
307,vgmolusharma,An Acting Clinic!,8,18 April 2019,"The most glorious feature of this movie is the casting. What an ensemble! It very fruitfully showcases one of the best ensembles in movies. Ofcourse Meryl and Julia makes you feel like not shifting your focus from them through their explosive combination on screen with both of them reflecting years of experience and hard work, successfully honing their scintillating acting talents. But you simply fail due to exuberant efforts of Ewan McGregor, Benedict Cumberbatch, Abigail Breslin, Chris Cooper and Juliette Lewis. Margo Martindale nails every scene which clearly makes you feel like she still needs more appreciation than she usually gets, which is great too, by the way. Julianne Nicholson turns out to be a total surprise package in the flick while Dermot Mulroney shows bravery while playing probably the only character in the movie that audience doesn't sympathize with at any stage. Sam Shepard vividly potrays his character with utmost love and celibacy that you miss him after his screen time. Misty Upham is worthy of a special mention for balancing her silence with expressing everything through her eyes.The raw emotion of each of these people hits you like a ton of bricks without any CGI or any great visual effect. Just plain human emotions that successfully finds a way with your soul despite appearing downright maddening and crazily dark at first. The usp is the four-day interaction between these complex characters at a time when each of them are battling an inner fight.There are so many terrific scenes with satisfying longevity in the movie that ardently serves your appetite for drama. One of the rare situations when movies adapted from plays actually do justice to the material. Perhaps the only thing you might not like about this movie, and it's very strange thing to complain about, is the calibre of the each individual's performance; it is so powerful and emotional that it becomes a bit fatiguing when combined together, making you feel a bit restless and gasping for a breathe of fresh air.August Osage County is dark, twisted and straightforward at the same time!
