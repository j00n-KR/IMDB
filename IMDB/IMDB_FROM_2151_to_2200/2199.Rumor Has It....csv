0,SnoopyStyle,Great high concept but bad chemistry between Aniston and Ruffalo,6,18 January 2014,"This is a high concept movie where the story behind 'The Graduate' is actually based on true life. Sarah Huttinger (Jennifer Aniston) is coming home with her boyfriend Jeff Daly (Mark Ruffalo) for her sister Annie (Mena Suvari)'s wedding. She learns that the movie may be based on her family history. She may be the result of a union between her mother and Beau Burroughs (Kevin Costner) who also slept with her grandmother (Shirley MacLaine). When she finally meets him, she does something that may be in the family character.I love the idea, but I don't like the Jennifer Aniston and Mark Ruffalo couple. There is no chemistry at all. When Kevin Costner saunters in, his ease is immediately disarming. The relationship has some uncomfortableness that is handled deftly with humor. This is where most of the funny jokes reside. I really don't see the Ruffalo Aniston pairing and that's why the ending doesn't work. These two are probably going to get divorced down the road. Sarah tells Annie that it's good to marry her best friend. I'm not convinced that Sarah and Jeff are best friends. They're more like annoyed acquaintances.",Rumor Has It...
1,Prismark10,"Not just a rumour, a bad film",2,1 July 2016,"The film is inspired by the plot of The Graduate. If only this was half as good as that classic. The premise is that the author of the novel, The Graduate based his book on real people who lived in 1960s Pasadena. A bride who ran away with this young graduate three days before her wedding and the guy had also slept with her mother, the original Mrs Robinson.Sarah (Jennifer Aniston) is engaged to be married to Jeff (Mark Ruffalo) who attends her sister's wedding, hears about this rumour and she realises that life might had imitated art. Her late mother may have had an affair with Beau Burroughs (Kevin Costner) several days before her wedding. Sarah wonders if Burroughs could be her real father and that she also slept with her grandmother (Shirley Maclaine.)Sarah heads of to find Beau Burroughs who is a dot com millionaire and it looks like she could be the third generation in her family to fall for his charms.As romantic comedy it fails on both counts. There were moments in this film I watched in utter embarrassment that this drivel was being passed on to me as entertainment from a director of the calibre of Rob Reiner.There is no chemistry of a spark of romance between Sarah and Jeff, you can see it when they attempt to have sex in an aeroplane bathroom (which is kind of difficult at the time when this movie was made with increased aeroplane security in the USA, believe me I tried it in that era!)Sarah's father (Richard Jenkins) makes jokes about Pasadena and has silly games like holding one's breath while driving through a tunnel. Making a family quirky does not make them funny.The script was misconceived and left their actors flailing about with what they had. Costner, Jenkins and Mena Suvari were wasted. Ruffalo was just ill at ease. Maclaine could had played her role in her sleep as the glamorous grandmother.",Rumor Has It...
2,claudio_carvalho,"What a Silly and Ridiculous Plot, and a Lack of Respect With ""The Graduate""",3,25 June 2006,"I can not believe that a lucid person can like this flick, unless a fan of Jennifer Aniston, or Kevin Costner, or Shirley MacLaine, or Mark Ruffalo. The plot is one of the most silly and ridiculous I have ever seen in a movie: Sarah Huttinger heard a rumor that her grandmother might have been the real ""Mrs. Robinson"" that inspired the successful movie ""The Graduate"". She decides to investigate the truth and finds that the man that had sex with her grandmother, had also with her mother and in the end she meets him and completes the fate of the women of her family also having sex with the guy. Is it funny? Have I missed some point about this dysfunctional family of whores? This rumor has no humor, is an awful lack of respect with ""The Graduate"" and a great disappointment. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""Dizem Por Ai"" (""It is Told That"")",Rumor Has It...
3,kosmasp,Connection,6,6 April 2007,"The best thing this movie has going for it, is it's influence ... ""The Graduate"". You could argue about the actors too (Kevin Costner, Jennifer Aniston, Mark Ruffalo, Mena Suvari and others) or even the director Rob Reiner (A few good Men, Misery, Princess Bride, When Harry met Sally and so forth), but this movie isn't their best work ... by far! So the connection to the Graduate (don't read this paragraph unless you've also seen the Graduate with Dustin Hoffman) is, what if that whole movie was true! What if a man really went through the things Dustin Hoffman went through and loved many women along the way (mothers and daughters) and Jennifer Anistons character was one the offspring's? Dustin Hoffman character is now played by Kevin Costner ... although there is very little humour to be found here, those few times are at least very good ...Not a masterpiece, but can be light headed fun, if you let it (still, I should've only haven given it 5/10!",Rumor Has It...
4,jboothmillard,Rumor Has It...,3,9 June 2013,"I read the description for this film, at first it sounded like a relatively interesting plot idea, but of course it would also turn out to be a rather ridiculous one, so no wonder the critics gave it a low rating, from director Rob Reiner (Stand By Me, When Harry Met Sally, Misery). Basically Sarah Huttinger (Jennifer Aniston) has accepted the marriage proposal of her long time lawyer boyfriend Jeff Daly (Mark Ruffalo), and before the ceremony they spend time with her family in Pasadena, including father Earl (The Cabin in the Woods' Richard Jenkins), sister Annie (Mena Suvari) and grandmother Katharine Richelieu (Shirley MacLaine). Hearing a rumour about something happening before she was born, including her parents marrying nine months before her birth, Sarah questions whether or not Earl is really her biological father, and then she discovers the reality of the situation. She finds out her grandmother Katharine was part of the real life inspiration for the movie The Graduate, she was Mrs. Robinson who seduced a young university student while married, and before the wedding of Sarah's mother to her father. So with this theory stuck in her head that there are differences between her and Earl she goes to find the man she believes may be her real father, and she hears the name Beau Burroughs, similar to Dustin Hoffman character name Benjamin Braddock. Sarah finds Beau Burroughs (Kevin Costner), who is a successful author, and she explains the situation to him, and while he accepts that he did have an affair years ago with her grandmother, he has never been able to produce children because of a biological problem. Upset that she was wrong about him he can only comfort her, but slowly this comforting turn into affection between them, and they end up kissing, but regrettably sleeping together. There is the moment Sarah feels sick thinking she may be wrong about the fatherhood situation, but this is further confirmed when she mistakes his son as being biological, his son is Blake (Mike Vogel) was artificially inseminated into his mother. Of course Jeff finds out that his fiancée slept with another man, and this breaks them apart for some time, but Sarah absolutely regrets doing it, saying it meant nothing and will do anything to prove how much she loves him, including marrying him much sooner, and in the end he does forgive her and they do get married. Also starring Christopher McDonald as Roger McManus, Steve Sandvoss as Scott and Kathy Bates as Aunt Mitsy. Aniston may look nice and be all innocent, and MacLaine may be amusing being the formerly saucy grandmother, but Costner, although likable, is not completely convincing as a bloke to have a one night stand with, some of the one- liners are okay but do not add any more than a titter, there are no big laughs, and the script if of course the biggest disappointment, trying to make an unconvincing ""true rumour"" funny or dramatic, it is pretty ludicrous, this comedy drama just doesn't all work very well. Adequate!",Rumor Has It...
5,blanche-2,life should be a little nuts,6,21 March 2013,"""Rumor Has It,"" from 2005, stars Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Costner, Shirley MacLaine, Mark Ruffalo, and Mira Suvari.The story concerns a young woman, Sarah Huttimger (Aniston) from Pasadena and her fiancé Jeff (Ruffalo) who travels from New York to Pasadena for Sarah's sister Anne's wedding. After hearing her father's toast, Jeff suggests that Sarah may have been conceived before the wedding. Sarah asks her grandmother (Shirley MacLaine) about her mother, who is deceased, and finds out that before her father, she had a brief fling with a man named Beau Burroughs in Cabo San Lucas a week before her wedding. After a few more questions, Sarah realizes that her family is the notorious family on which the book and then movie The Graduate is based - meaning that her grandmother also slept with Beau.Sarah has always felt out of place in her family, and she wonders if Beau Burroughs could be her father. So she finds out where he is and goes to San Francisco to find him, leaving her fiancé to return to New York by himself. The trip proves to be a watershed one -- Sarah, who doesn't know who she is, knows even less after meeting Beau Burroughs.This is a pretty middle of the road comedy, a good rental but probably not something you'd want to pay money for in a movie theater. It might have worked a little better with better casting. Kevin Costner is a nice-looking man, very pleasant, but the role called for someone very charismatic with a good sense of comedy. Jennifer Aniston is fine but to be blunt, she's never been my idea of a movie star. She's attractive, she has a beautiful figure for clothes, and a pleasant presence. She does okay. When a script isn't the best, you need a little better than okay. The only people with any real spark were Shirley MacLaine and Kathy Bates, who had a brief cameo.I have one other complaint that is very minor. There were a lot of elderly people in this film at the beginning of the film and at a charity ball, each with a few lines each. Why not bring a few old-time classic film stars back? Joan Leslie, Peggy Cummins, Ann Rutherford, Jane Withers - it would have been great in 2005. It's fine to appeal to a thirty-something audience, but it's nice to pay homage to the old Hollywood too.All in all, decent.",Rumor Has It...
6,edwagreen,Rumor Has It How this Film Deteriorates **,5,19 May 2006,"This picture begins with a funny premise. A woman, attending her sister's wedding, discovers that her mother was Mrs. Robinson from ""The Graduate.""Kevin Costner is the guy who had the affair with the mother who is now deceased as well as the grandma Shirley MacLaine. MacLaine seems to be in a new career mold as a lively senior citizen. She is a pleasure to watch on the screen.The problem with ""Rumor Has It"" is that the film goes down once we see differences between it and the original ""The Graduate.""As the let-down boyfriend, Mark Ruffalo is charming on screen. Kathy Bates appears in one scene as the friend of the late woman. She really has put on weight.Jennifer Aniston is appealing in the role of the daughter who very well realizes that the man she is falling for could very well be her dad. Though we see that this is not the case, we are still annoyed by a possible incestuous relationship.",Rumor Has It...
7,wes-connors,"""The Graduate"" Gets Old",4,7 June 2009,"Harboring doubts about her identity, friendly Jennifer Aniston (as Sarah Huttinger) returns to her Pasadena, California home, to attend her sister's wedding. After arriving, Ms. Aniston follows clues to uncover an old family skeleton - she confirms that her family provided the characters for Charles Webb's ""The Graduate"" (1963), which became the even more famous 1967 Mike Nichols-directed film starring Anne Bancroft (as Mrs. Robinson), Dustin Hoffman (as Benjamin Braddock), and Katharine Ross (as Elaine Robinson). Aniston is the daughter of the ""Elaine"" character, and granddaughter of the original ""Mrs. Robinson"" (the character played by Ms. Bancroft).Continuing from ""The Graduate""...We learn Mr. Hoffman's character ""Benjamin Braddock"" did not marry ""Elaine"", after running away with her at the end of the 1967 film. After a few days of romance, ""Elaine"" abruptly left ""Ben"", went home, and married the other guy (""Carl""). As it turns out, ""Elaine"" was pregnant with Jennifer Aniston. Three decades later, ""Elaine"" (Aniston's mother) is dead; and, Aniston wonders why she doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of her family. She thinks ""The Graduate"" may be her father; presently, she locates him in the form of successful businessman Kevin Costner (as Beau ""Ben"" Burroughs), with help from still smokin' Shirley MacLaine (as Katherine ""Mrs. Robinson"" Richelieu). (Aside: Guys, this may be a good film to get her ""in the mood."") ""Rumor Has It"" also parallels ""The Graduate"" in that it features a protagonist, uncertain bout her path in life, who is seduced by an older individual. Alas, this film's seduction has a creepy suggestion of incest. But, even worse is the fact that Aniston's fiancé, Mark Ruffalo (as Jeff Daly), is played so endearingly, you wonder what Aniston was thinking. In the original, Ross was gorgeous, but aloof and cool. The characters played by Mr. Costner and Ms. MacLaine are watered-down versions of those played by Hoffman and Bancroft. **** Rumor Has It...

Disappointingly mirthless comedy about a young woman (Aniston in arguably one of her worst performances) who is determined to find out if her family was the inspiration to THE GRADUATE and if in fact her real father is the roguish Costner who had a fling with her late mother and her prickly grandmother (MacLaine making a cottage industry as battle-axes with a heart of gold pickled in alcohol). Ted Griffin's screenplay seems lost in translation by director Rob Reiner, who sadly continues his mediocre track record, offering no laughs or poignancy. Griffin incidentally was supposed to make his directorial debut but was sacked days within production for Reiner to step in ; one wonders what would've been.",Rumor Has It...
9,ferguson-6,One Word ... Awful,3,1 January 2006,"Greetings again from the darkness. For years I have been hoping someone with vision would do some type of sequel to one of my favorite films, ""The Graduate"". When I heard Rob Reiner was involved in a story based on the real life Mrs. Robinson, I was thrilled. However, there is no real way to express my disappointment in the final product.This story and film are ridiculous. Shirley MacLaine manages to save a little face with her performance, but hopefully every other actor and writer is embarrassed at the outcome. Somehow Kevin Costner (born in 1955) gets cast to play Bo Burroughs (get it? ... Benjamin Braddock) who is from the class of 1959 - we even get to see his yearbook photo! Jennifer Aniston's character is supposedly the offspring of Katherine Ross' Elaine, but is confused as to who her real father is due to her birth timing. She does not wish to discuss this with her Father ... rather she takes off on some ludicrous investigative journey. Mind you, these are grown-ups! Ms. Aniston has 5 films set for release over the next 18 months. She needs at least one decent performance or her screen career will be over and it will be back to the sit com world. Kathy Bates is totally wasted in her one scene and Mark Ruffalo appears humiliated to speak his lines (which he should be). His character shows a little spark during the confrontation at the Ball, but mostly I kept thinking ... what a wimp! This film is a clinic on overacting and poor writing. Director Rob Reiner's eye for filming moments and faces is still evident, but it is not enough. By the way, ENOUGH of the profile shots of Jen!! Reiner will always have a place in film lore thanks to ""This is Spinal Tap"" ""The Princess Bride"" and ""When Harry Met Sally"". He will always be dismayed when he sees ""Rumor Has it"" listed on his filmography. One bright spot is listening to the fabulous Taj Mahal over the final credits ... which just don't come soon enough!",Rumor Has It...
10,anaconda-40658,Rumor Has It That This Film is Decent.,8,20 April 2016,"Rumor Has It (2005): Dir: Rob Reiner / Cast: Kevin Costner, Jennifer Aniston, Mark Ruffalo, Shirley MacLaine, Mena Survari: Gossip takes a different stance in this ambitious romantic comedy. Intriguing plot stars Jennifer Aniston who learns that the 1967 film The Graduate may have true ties within her family. Director Rob Reiner sides against a remake in favor of a detailed and clever screenplay. This is a great improvement after directing such duds as The Story of Us and Ghosts of Mississippi. Aniston delivers one of her best performances as a confused woman who cannot relate to her family and drastically searches for answers. Mark Ruffalo plays her fiancée with understanding and charm despite their straight forward fates. Shirley MacLaine steals scenes as Aniston's grandmother who is believed to have inspired Mrs. Robinson in The Graduate. Likewise Kevin Costner is rumored to be the inspiration for Benjamin Braddock whom Aniston believes to be her real father. Mena Suvari appears as Aniston's sister who is getting married but many supporting roles are too self aware. Chatter about actress Katherine Ross of The Graduate, and whom Aniston believes to have played her, seems more contrived than funny, however Reiner succeeds in creating a terrific film with some connection to another film that is unique and drive a theme of family ties and the histories that evolve. Score: 8 ½ / 10",Rumor Has It...
11,HotToastyRag,Fantastic Must-See!,10,12 June 2017,"Jennifer Aniston plays a woman confused. She's confused about her fiancé, her family, her origins, and herself. When she learns her late mother had an affair before she married her father, she sets out to find the mysterious man, in case he's her biological father. A parallel plot line is the correlation to Aniston's mother's affair; it mirrors the infamous love story of The Graduate, and the movie pretends the affair is the fictional inspiration behind that movie.The preview of this movie will show you one-liners from Shirley MacLaine, pouty faces from Aniston, and a comedic plot. Rumor Has It is so much more than that. Yes, the script has some hilarious moments, and yes, Aniston is beautiful and pouty in most of the film, but at its core, the film deals with grief, confusion, and finding one's sense of self. I've seen this movie over twenty times, and it hasn't gotten old. The script is smart, the casting is a likable bunch, and the acting is wonderful.Everyone's performance is superb. Jennifer Aniston's character, on paper, could be a snarky, problematic woman with a bad attitude. She softens the lines and adds humanity to the role. Kevin Costner also softens his role with his unique charm, a role that could be seen as an over-the-hill lech, but with his touch is a sympathetic, grieving man. Mark Ruffalo, always a chameleon in his roles, shows audiences his smart, classy side by playing Aniston's lawyer fiancé. Even though we're used to seeing him with a little layer of ""street"", he's totally believable in his suit and tie. And let's not forget the overlooked performance of Richard Jenkins, who plays Aniston's father. Every parent will find a kindred spirit in his portrayal, and he also softens the lines that could be interpreted as gruff or insensitive in an initial read-through. I always say when one actor is great, it's the actor. When everyone's great, it's the director. Hats off to Rob Reiner for a job well done.",Rumor Has It...
12,gradyharp,Pretty Banal Storyline but with some Good Moments Courtesy of the Cast,4,10 May 2006,"Rumor has it that this is a pretty banal movie. The rumor is true. Ted Griffin, the screenwriter from Pasadena, and a writer with some pretty fine screenplays under his belt (Matchstick Men, Ocean's Eleven), somehow felt the need to cash in on the re-release of the classic film THE GRADUATE about his hometown idiosyncrasies and make a 30 years later 'sequel'. Bad choice: the comparisons between the two films are just too far apart to endure tolerance from the audience.Rob Reiner has made some fine films in the past, but he lets this little bit of pastiche just get out of control. The few laughs that are implied come form some gritty lines from Katherine (veteran Shirley MacLaine), playing the grandmother of Sarah (Jennifer Aniston), who was the model for 'Mrs. Robinson' in the book THE GRADUATE. It seems that Aniston returns for her sister Annie's (Mena Suvari) wedding to hunky Scott (Steve Sandvoss from 'Latter Days' fame) with her affianced Jeff (Mark Ruffalo) only to realize that she doesn't seem to fit into Pasadena much less her family. Never close to her father (Richard Jenkins) she hears that her mother had a fling with one Beau (Kevin Costner) and that she may be the offspring of Beau and her mother. How she discovers the reality of the rumor is the point (or lack thereof) of the movie.With Aniston, MacLaine, Ruffalo, Costner and Jenkins in the cast the film has to have some good points - and it does. It is just that the idea for the story is too lame to digest and too poorly written to buy into, making this a film to watch only if you happen to love the cast. Grady Harp",Rumor Has It...
13,zetes,"Great concept, great acting - so why does it turn out so weak?",6,29 May 2006,"This is the kind of movie that just pisses me off to no end because it has so much potential, but somehow it comes off as exceedingly mediocre. Jennifer Aniston plays a woman who discovers her family was the model for the novel and film The Graduate. She never saw how she fit in with her family, so she wonders if maybe the model for Benjamin, a rich man named Beau Burroughs (Kevin Costner), is her real father. She's wrong, but in the process of this discovery, she ends up sleeping with the man, thus continuing the tradition of her mother (deceased) and grandmother (played here by Shirley MacLaine). This in turn ruins her relationship with her loving fiancé (Mark Ruffalo). I remember seeing the trailer last fall and thinking, ""This is a great idea."" I laughed pretty much constantly during that preview. Unfortunately, it contains most of the film's best moments. The actual film is more of a romance (or perhaps a better term would be ""chick flick"") than a comedy. It gets somewhat sappy, and the whole thing lumbers on and his never very strong. This is especially annoying, as all the actors are actually very good. Aniston proves once again that she is a very good actress (if only she could land some great material). Costner gives his second excellent performance of the year (I thought his performance in The Upside of Anger was perhaps the year's best performance from an actor). He was so mediocre earlier on, it's kind of cool to see that maybe he is just now hitting his peak. Mark Ruffalo is very funny, as is Mena Suvari, who plays Aniston's younger sister. And MacLaine's role is absolutely golden. She also had a very good performance elsewhere in '05 (In Her Shoes), but she has even more to do here and she flexes her comic muscles. With all that goodness, it really pains me that it's so hard to muster any enthusiasm for this somewhat lame film!",Rumor Has It...
14,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Rumor Has It,8,23 February 2006,"Based on a true rumor, the premise of the movie was set up oh-so perfectly, especially if you're a fan of Mike Nichols' 1967 Dustin Hoffman-Anne Bancroft movie, The Graduate (with its immortal line uttered again in this film). It's pretty creative to have that story and characters intertwined with the narrative of this movie.In this Jennifer Aniston vehicle (is it always that the wives of more famous husbands get meatier roles when they break up?), she plays an obituary writer (another fashionable job since Jude Law became one in Closer) Sarah Huttinger, who's the fiancée of Jeff Daly (Mark Ruffalo). However, she's commitment phobic and is getting cold feet each time Jeff brings up marriage, and it doesn't help that they're attending her sister's (Mena Suvari), therefore meeting her dad (Richard Jenkins) and other relatives she can't get along with.But rumor after rumor, and having realize that her deceased mother had gone for a fling before her own marriage, Sarah begins an investigative hunt into those (un)faithful days, and with probing for more information from her grandma Katharine (Shirley MacLaine), she discovers Beau Burroughs (Kevin Costner), the man whom Dustin Hoffman's Ben was modeled after. So it goes that the writer of The Graduate, Charles Webb, is a close friend of Beau, and the story is based loosely on his dalliances with Katharine. Which also means, as Sarah discovers, that the book and movie, is based on her family! But it gets better (or is it worse?) as Sarah herself falls for Beau and has a one-night stand, bringing to mind all the dirty, sick thoughts of possible incest. The audience gets teased every now and then when you attempt to piece together the possible relationships between the characters, and it gets worse as we go along, until the final revelation at the end. It's amazing too how you become glued to the story, despite its simplicity in its themes.Which is surprisingly not romantic relationship per se, which got shoved to the sidelines, but that of commitment. It tries to examine what makes people stick to each other, and what it takes to accept, forgive, and find courage to move on. If you're bringing your date to his movie, have the correct mindset - it's not just another simple date movie, but one which sets both of you thinking. It's got some kick in it too, all thanks to references to The Graduate movie.Lifting this movie is again the veterans of Shirley MacLaine and Richard Jenkins. MacLaine has played the grandma role to two sisters earlier this year in In Her Shoes. However, this is not a simple rehash of the role, as this one's a little more slapstick, a little more Mrs Robinson, a little more caustic in language and character, but a lot lot lesser screen time. Richard Jenkins too plays the familiar father figure who stands by his daughters, ala his dad role in North Country shown earlier. No doubt that their roles are small, but their characters, all powerful.Kevin Costner seems to be moving to making smaller movies. I won't say that he's excellent in this movie, because it felt like it was a stroll in the park. Having him falling for and romancing a younger woman in Aniston, was similar to his role last year in The Upside of Anger. All eyes though will be on Jennifer Aniston, as her character has certain takes on relationships that cut a little close to her real life split and how she moved on.It's a movie which you think the trailers had revealed all, but trust me, it delivered a lot more than what the trailers suggested. It's fun, witty, and refreshing to a certain extent. Do give this movie a watch if spoilt for choices from the Oscar contenders amongst the crowded theater schedules.",Rumor Has It...
15,SimonJack,"In spite of big names, this plot theme doesn't do well for comedy",3,14 February 2019,"""Rumor Has It"" has a cast of big names for 2005, and the Warner Brothers and other producers no doubt thought they had a big hit with this film. And why not? It was made as a sequel to the 1967 smash hit, ""The Graduate."" The story of this film, using different names, picks up were the first film left off, about 30 years into the future. But Hollywood guessed wrong this time.Western culture began to change rapidly in the 21st century (progressive to those on the left, regressive to those on the right, morally-socially), and Hollywood mostly has ""pushed the envelope"" over the years. More than one director or producer has so stated on some big film successes. Sometimes it works, at others times it doesn't. It proves that Hollywood is never a good barometer with which to measure sociological changes or mores of the culture.From an otherwise good comedy script, and with its cast of big names and mostly decent acting, this film flops. The blame must therefore rest with the theme and plot. It seems clear that the idea of incest is not something that most people can find funny or a source of comedy. That the same man would have sex with three women in one family in successive generations hasn't yet caught the fancy of the public imagination.One reason for that probably is that there are many people living today who have been sexually abused. More than 50% of sexual abuse cases happen within families; and the number is 85% when extended to include friends of families. Hollywood needs to look to its past when writing and filming of subjects in which many people have been hurt. Some fine comedies and satires were made about Nazi Germany during and after the war. But they never used the Holocaust for humor. And, other treatments were handled carefully - torture, concentration camps, etc. Even then, many survivors of that evil were not at ease with Hollywood films that mixed comedy with horror.This film actually has some clever and funny dialog in places. And, except for Kevin Costner's generally listless performance, the cast do very well acting. But a pall hangs over the whole plot. It has an unsavory taste about it. And that has the effect of squelching any of the humor in the dialog. This film bombed big in the U.S. where it barely recovered 60 percent of its $70 million budget. Only with a bigger worldwide take, especially in Europe, which is more Avant-garde in its mores, was it able to cover its losses.The setting of the film was supposed to be in the late 1990s, while Bill Clinton was in the White House. One scene shows President Clinton on TV. Among photos on a work counter is one of Kevin Costner with President Clinton. We never learn what Costner's character, Beau Burroughs, does for a living, but he's a big shot of some kind. When Clinton appears on TV, Jennifer Aniston's Sara Huttinger asks Burroughs, ""Do you know him?"" Burroughs replies, ""I'm not sure anyone really knows him. I've spent time with him."" That's an interesting line of dialog for 2005, which probably signals that the story was taking place in 1998 after Clinton's 1995-96 sex scandal with Monica Lewinsky became widely known.The possibility of incest and having slept with her grandfather or father bothers Sarah after she learns more about Burroughs. The script doesn't handle the conversations very well after that. In one scene, Sarah says, ""You, you've slept with my mother and my grandmother."" Burroughs replies, ""What's your point?"" She says, ""My point, I mean, I... This is not moral. I mean, you know what, you are too old for me. I mean, obviously I am very confused right now... and last night was some sort of, I don't know - rite of passage."" This may have been confusing to most of the audience as well. Sarah didn't think it was right, but she wanted to sleep with him, except that he was too old for her.Director Rob Reiner and writer Ted Griffin probably thought the next lines of dialog were great, but I think they helped seal an unsavory, dirty feel about this film. Sarah says, ""Maybe every girl in my family has to sleep with you."" Burroughs answers, ""Well, I don't know if they have to, but they certainly have."" Would that include her younger sister who was just getting married?One of the few good lines of comedy comes from Shirley MacLaine's Katharine Richelieu. She says to Sarah, as they head into dinner with drinks in hand, ""You'll tell me everything after dinner. We'll be drunk then, so I'll expect dirt.""",Rumor Has It...
16,siderite,Ovulating woman meets Kevin Costner,7,21 May 2006,"Suposedly a continuation of the plot in The Graduate, this is another Jennifer Anston flick with her as a confused female getting into an even more confusing family situation. In this one she gets it on with the man that also had an intimate knowledge of her mother and grandmother.All people react in a rather predictable way, the people cast are veterans of their roles with Kevin Costner as the seducing male, Shirley McLaine as the reluctant grandmother, Mark Ruffalo as the nice guy boyfriend that forgives all, Richard Jenkins as the father and Mena Suvari as the younger ""bouncing"" sister.My wife, though, loved the film. Laughed throughout it, identified with all female characters, wanted to keep the film, etc. So, it's a chick flick.

She is still concerned with why her and her father have never really been the same, looks and personality wise, but when her aunt, cameo by Kathy Bates, tells her about an old flame of her mother's, Sarah is curious to why her grandmother was also attracted to him. Maybe it's because her family is actually the Robinsons from the Graduate story! She flies to see the author of the book and her possible father and finds out that he's sterile and can't have kids. So, she sleeps with him when she's drunk, sick, I know, and messes up a possible future with a great guy.It was predictable and a bit silly, but like I said, you'll get a couple light laughs. I think the story was very good, but they could've cleared a few things up a little better, because the beginning I was still a little confused, but it worked itself out. Over all, I'd recommend this for an afternoon movie, but it's nothing too special.6/10",Rumor Has It...
18,MLDinTN,Jennifer Aniston and Kevin Costner together = YUK,3,3 January 2007,"Aniston is miscast and doesn't really fit the role. Since leaving Friends, she just can't seem to find a good movie role. And playing a semi-love interest to Kevin Costner, whose character had slept with her mother and grandmother was just plain gross. Aniston is too thin for her age and it was very hard to believe that the sister and dad in this were related to her because they look nothing alike. It's is like Aniston tries to find roles for a 25 year old when she is almost 40. She needs to find age appropriate roles.And it is the whole Hollywood idea of thinking since Jeff takes Sarah back after finding out she cheated on him with some old guy. It was just gross.The few laughs come from Shirley Mclaine who plays the sarcastic grandmother.FINAL VERDICT: Another Jennifer Aniston bomb.",Rumor Has It...
19,vincentlynch-moonoi,Very good acting; script misfires,7,12 October 2021,"I usually don't review a film that already has this many reviews, but I'm going to here. I give this film a very weak ""7"". All the time I sat watching it, I kept trying to figure out what was wrong with it. I finally came to the conclusion that most of the acting performances here were quite good. The problem was the script.So what was the problem? In my view a gimmick -- trying to initially link the story to the much older film ""The Graduate"". That just wasn't necessary; it was -- in my view -- the gimmick to draw in people who remembered well ""The Graduate"". That wasn't needed to the basic story at all.As far as the acting goes, I'm not fan of Jennifer Aniston, but she did really well here. I'm not a fan of Kevin Costner, but he did really well here. Shirley MacLaine always seems to do well, but she's not a favorite of mine. I'm not a fan of Mark Ruffalo, but he did really well here. I've always been pleased that character actor Richard Jenkins (who plays the father here) is one supporting actor that has earned a fine reputation in Hollywood; he deserves it.I'm not going to go on about this, but if you decide to watch this film, forget about ""The Graduate"" and just enjoy the basic film for what it is, and enjoy some really good acting.",Rumor Has It...

Like ""In Her Shoes"" (2005), this movie is more popular family drama than comedy, another return to an older movie genre that hasn't been around as much. But unlike ""In Her Shoes,"" this movie doesn't quite have the same chemistry nor constant attraction for some reason. The music seems not always to be in sync with the mood or tone of the movie. The on-screen interest seems a bit flat. Only Shirley MacLaine has the delightful flair for comedy and off-beat, delicious personality in this movie. The screenplay was appropriate and avoided the usual bland and stereotypical pitfalls, but it failed to really probe or push the envelope sufficient to create the necessary compelling interest to make up for the rather superficial characters presented on screen.

What the hell, I liked it for what it is...Sarah (supposedly born in the year 1964!) is a woman with a regular job as a wedding reporter or something like that, she has a serious relationship but she isn't sure about who she is; and worse of all, she's having cold feet towards marriage. In her young sister's wedding she finds out that she may not be her defunct mother's biological daughter. A series of events lead to a confusing situation where Sarah contacts her supposedly biological father but she ends up sleeping with him! The same man who also slept with her mother and her grandmother! That man's name is Beau (Kevin Costner). Sarah soon finds out who she really is and she also realizes that she's been trying to be just like her mother. She also finally solves her loving situation.

24,iquine,Cheap Romance Fluff,5,31 October 2019,(Flash Review)This movie tried to color outside the RomCom lines but was too afraid to push the crayon over the those black borders. It was a stereotypical RomCom about hesitation to marry for a safe and secure life because the perceived loss of adventure and newness is staring this lady right in the face. This movie takes a lighthearted approach to portraying cheating on your significant other due to those concerns. That story line awkwardly extends the story idea of the film The Graduate. It also portrays the respectable and secure guys in shallow depth vs the refreshing carefreeness of the more adventurous gentleman in this story. The surface story is Aniston learning about the unfaithful past of both her mother and grandmother and seeks to uncover the actual facts of her past. Will she be able resist not replicating the same mistakes? This had a moderately compelling story with some weak character decisions with minor humor sprinkled about. It is rather surprising at how quickly people accept and each woman's behavior by comparison to The Graduate and just in general.,Rumor Has It...

This comedy starring Jennifer Aniston, Shirley MacLaine, Mark Ruffalo, and Kevin Costner. The plot is kinda interesting, but it's not executed nearly as well as it could have been. This film did have some good potential, unfortunately it just didn't go much of anywhere with that potential, it wasn't utilized. Jennifer Aniston did alright, she was funny enough in some scenes, and then just alright in others, I mean truth be told, anyone could've played this role in particular. Now there is one performance here that I loved, and that is Shirley MacLaine's performance, I thought she was hilarious and just so deliciously diva-ish. MacLaine was definitely my favorite thing about Rumor has it. Costner was pretty good, I mean the acting as a whole in this film is just alright, besides Shirley of course, there's just not all that much to brag about on that subject. The comedy is there sometimes, and works, but then more times that not..... It fall flat. Unfortunately I cannot recommend Rumor has it......

27,EUyeshima,"Resuscitating a Classic Movie with a Lacking, Lethargic Sequel Three Decades Later",4,11 April 2007,"There are moments in this inconsequential 2005 comedy when I can see a bright future for Jennifer Aniston's light comedic talents, even though this movie does not stretch her much beyond her likeably insecure ""Friends"" persona. She plays Sarah Huttinger, a likeably insecure New York Times obituary writer going home to Pasadena to attend her younger sister Annie's wedding. Sarah is picture-pretty, 33 and engaged to a nice, unflappable guy named Jeff who accompanies her. At the same time, she's unhappy about her career and wondering why she always feels out-of-sorts with her well-to-do family. A ray of light comes from her only kindred spirit in the family, her feisty, tart-tongued grandmother Katherine, who tells Sarah about her late mother's pre-wedding tryst in Mexico that gives rise to questions about Sarah's paternity.All the domestic shenanigans that ensue would probably be enough to fill this comedy's blessedly brief 96-minute running time, but screenwriter Ted Griffin hangs it all on the idea that Sarah's family may have been the inspiration for the Robinsons in Charles Webb's 1963 novel, ""The Graduate"", which of course, is the basis of Mike Nichols' classic 1967 movie. The tie-in must have sounded like a creative idea on paper, but something happened on the way to the screen that has taken most of the comic invention out of it. In fact, there is a pervasive lethargy throughout this movie, and director Rob Reiner is unable to overcome it because Sarah's dilemma of choosing between adventure and predictability never feels that emotionally resonant. The dialogue never feels sharp, perceptive or funny enough to pull off the inevitable comparisons with the earlier film. Moreover, the story is set rather arbitrarily in 1997 to make the timelines make sense with the stars' ages.Beyond Aniston, a strong cast has been set adrift. Playing Katherine like an even more embittered variation on Aurora Greenway, Shirley MacLaine crackles with aplomb as the possible inspiration for Mrs. Robinson, even when her lines are not as snappy as she thinks they are. As the aging but still magnetic Benjamin Braddock doppelganger, a high-tech mogul named Beau Burroughs, an overly sedate Kevin Costner barely registers in a smallish role. When he does, there is an insinuating, almost creepy quality in the way Beau's relationship with Sarah evolves. Until the end, Mark Ruffalo has little to do as Jeff but wait patiently for Sarah to resolve her personal dilemma. Richard Jenkins and Mena Suvari have even less time to make an impression in the underwritten roles of Sarah's passive father and bubbly sister, respectively. The 2006 DVD provides the original theatrical trailer (which gives away most of the plot) as its sole extra.",Rumor Has It...
28,dierregi,Good comedy for grown ups,6,31 July 2008,"This movie got mixed reviews and yet it is not that bad. Obviously it is an inferior product compared to ""The graduate"", the movie that sets everything in motion, but it still can hold its own.The premise is that ""The graduate"" was based on a true story, and two main characters – Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson - are still alive. Sadly Elaine (Mrs. Robinson's daughter) passed away, but if she was still around there would not be any ""Rumor"".Enter ""Elaine""'s daughter Sarah (the Aniston character) who discovers all this during a long weekend in Pasadena with her fiancé Jeff. Her grandmother (the notorious Mrs. Robinson, played by a great Shirley McLaine) does not give much away, but Sarah is smart and finds out everything in a matter of hours.At this stage the movie diverges from the usually soppy (or mildly amusing) sentimental comedy. Sarah is not quite sure about her impending wedding, even if her fiancé is a lovely guy. She is persuaded that her own mother gave up love (in the form of Benjamin) to perform family duties with her boring father, and does not want to make the same mistake. So she embarks in the search for the guy who could be her real father. The Benjamin character, named Beau, is played by Kevin Costner, still too handsome to be believable as a fatherly figure.The tone of the movie is quite grown up and maybe this displeased part of the audience. Once Sarah discovers that Beau cannot be her father, she joins the family tradition and has sex with him, like her mother and grandmother before her (and despite the fact that she is engaged).American movies are very strict when it comes to sexual misbehavior, straying being almost always considered an unforgivable sin, but in this case, the grown-up approach sticks to the end. Sarah has a showdown with Jeff, who found out about her indiscretion, and they both behave as adults. Beau and ""Mrs. Robinson"" also have a showdown (it would have been great to see Hoffman and Bancroft meeting in the same circumstances) and Mrs. Robinson finally gets her great kiss-off line. Eventually, the only real loser is that same Beau who undeservedly ran away with the bride at the end of ""The graduate"".An interesting and compelling movie which also proves that having a fling does not necessarily mean living the rest of your life without love.",Rumor Has It...

I wanted to see 'rumor has it' a long time, but somehow, I never did. today, I had the luck it was on television. and I'm very happy I saw it, as I am with almost all films with Kevin Costner. even though his identity in this flick wasn't very much more than a casanova, he still does it again. just by looking, he steals away every scene he plays in. jennifer anniston is herself, she's always funny, beautiful and sometimes even philosophical... what can I say about the rest? maclaine, ruffolo and all the others... they do their part very well, but it is Costner who can be remembered the most after seeing this picture. poor Costner... nowadays, people **** on him because he knows he's an actor, but I ask you: why should he think he's NOT an actor? do you really want him to think he is a chicken?

31,triple8,"Despite being a bit cutesy, it's a fun quirky little movie.",7,4 July 2006,"SPOILERS THROUGH:I didn't think this was a bad movie. It's not an Oscar Winner that's for sure but it was based on a cute premise and the overall movie, while not being as truly hilarious as I'd pictured it, was engaging, moderately witty and at times a lot of fun. It does take awhile to get going though and the first 15-20 minutes do indeed drag but after that it picks up. It's a relatively short breezy flick. The movie was almost exactly as I'd pictured it from the previews except it wasn't as funny and the storyline became a romantic triangle mid stream. My biggest complaint is the lack of truly hilarious material, because, with a premise like this, the sky could have been the limit. Still it is fun. Shirley Mclain really does make the movie and Mark Ruffalo who Seems to play a lot of roles like this, is convincing and very good. And I did enjoy Costner in this role.As for Anniston herself, this is neither her best nor worst work. She plays it pretty similar to ""Rachel"" from Friends and while I think she's better in more Non mainstream ""indie"" type roles, she's fine here. This movie, despite the quirky premise isn't really all that different from a lot of romantic comedies out there although the premise itself is enough to kind of distinguish it.One thing that was interesting was that neither of the two men vying for Sara's affection was made to be a villain. Ruffalo's character seems genuinely nice and Costner's Beau maybe a rich playboy but he isn't made to be the typical villain trying to keep Anniston and Ruffalo apart. Although it was very similar to the way I'd pictured it from the previews,I was a bit surprised in the way the storyline went since I expected the whole thing to be about whether this family was really the basis for ""The Graduate"". But that really ceases to become the focus of the movie, as the movie goes instead to Sara being caught by her fiancée in Beau's arms. Not exactly the way I'd have thought this would go.The ending was simply odd. I will admit it was maybe a bit to sappy but because Ruffalo's character is such a nice guy one does want him to be happy even if one wonders if he can be happy with Sara. However at the end it's kind of strange how the cheating aspect is almost glossed over and I will admit certain aspects of this movie were in fact rather distasteful.The positives? A warm lovable cast who seemed anyway, to have fun making the movie. Great photography(Man did I wish I had a home like Beau's by the water!!). Quirky characters such as Maclain's character and the sister Annie played By Mena Suvari who was one of my favorite characters. I also liked Sara's dad and his conversation with Anniston at the end, as ""movieish"" as it was, was sweetly moving. And I just loved the premise since I'm a ""Graduate"" fan and I loved the music and the quirkiness of the movie. To sum up-this is by no means a great movie but it's OK and I'd give it around a low 7. I think it could have been better but it could have been a lot worse too.",Rumor Has It...

Aniston's character keeps her marriage proposal under wraps because she doesn't want to steal her sister's thunder but her boyfriend is peeved by this because he feels she has cold feet. This is all made worse by the fact that he cannot share a room with her when the arrive at her father's house. A reunion with her granny at the wedding rehearsal sparks some questions in Aniston's character as she slowly begins to piece together the reasons why she has felt so ill at ease around her family members. Her granny and her mother both had an affair with the same man years ago and Aniston believes that the man (played by Kevin Costner) could be her father. She pieces most of this together with the help of an old friend of her mother's (played by Kathy Bates). When time comes to return to NYC, she pleads with her boyfriend to let her go to San Francisco to meet with her mother's former lover and he reluctantly agrees.

33,valadas,Serious themes in a light way,7,20 March 2006,"Light but convincing. This comedy that tells us the story of a man who sleeps successively with grandmother, mother and daughter could be just that but it's much more. It makes us reflect upon more serious themes such as life, love and fidelity and how life and love can be opposed sometimes. And upon the fact that maybe there are several kinds of love that vary in intensity and duration. Love can arise with the force of lightning one night to die the following morning. Or it can develop itself slowly and last for a whole life. And what about marriage? You can for instance marry a true friend and be much happier that if you had married a lover. This reminds me of an old song by the once famous Mexican singer Ana Maria Gonzalez which said (I translate from Spanish where it had a rhyme): Love is very beautiful / Something you cannot deny / Give it little by little / And it will never end. Some of the characters' behaviours may seem odd indeed for instance those of grandmother and granddaughter but we must not forget that these two are not conventional personalities and they seem very authentic in their oddity. A last word to Shirley MacLaine in the role of the grandmother which she performs excellently. She is aging beautifully and I can still remember the roles she made long ago of a more or less candid girl. Her role now is totally different of course but she performs it with great skill.

If the whole story had been interesting in more ways than that, it could've worked out. But instead, I got a half-assed attempt at a spicy comedy that dies down to an uninspired romance with Mr. Boring himself - not that I'm totally against Kevin Costner, but this was a very weak role.A few small bits were okay, Aniston is always pleasant to watch and Ruffalo, Jenkins, Suvari and some other small supporting roles díd work out nicely, so I'll be gentle: 5 out of 10 - no, that's too gentle; 4 out of 10.",Rumor Has It...

I mean you directed Stand By Me, The Princess Bride, A Few Good Men, and This is Spinal Tap. What is up with the drivel nowadays, especially with this horrid attempt at cinematic art, Rumor Has It? I actually thought the premise had promise from the trailerthe real story of The Graduate. Intriguing and a decent cast attached, this should at the least be watchable. Unfortunately it most certainly is not, and I will even admit to not seeing the whole thing. I missed a bit of the beginning and the very end, but I don't care. This is coming from a guy who won't start a film if even a second has been missed. That is how forgettable the movie is.We have Jennifer Aniston about to get married, following her younger sister who has just tied the knot. She gets cold feet after finding out that her deceased mother and living grandmother were the inspiration for The Graduate, along with a man named Beau Burroughs. This revelation sends her off to find him and find out about her mother and whether her own conception made her mom leave her true love for the father. Of course she will end up completing the family heritage by sleeping with the man and thus getting even more confused about the situation. We all know that these little bumps in the road work themselves out, and even though I don't know for sure how it all ended, I am positive all smelled like roses and Burroughs was the reason everyone found out what it was they all truly wanted.The dialogue is mostly tragic and dripping with sappy clichés. At one point I was ready to just leave the room because the yelling and the acting was so over the top. We have Shirley MacLaine and Richard Jenkins, both of whom I like, on opposite ends of the phone with Aniston yelling on one side and Mena Suvari being more annoying than usual on the other. I literally was jarred from any semblance of continuity as the flow utterly screeched to a halt. The whole thing is predictable, ordinary, and pretty much sad overall. You know you're in trouble when Kevin Costner's performance is actually the one you are hoping to keep popping up. Not that he is a horrible actor, but honestly, he should never be the best one on screen for an hour and a half. Especially when you have a guy like Mark Ruffalo, who can hit anything out of the park. Alas, besides being hugely underused, I just have to say, please go back to your indie roots and show the brilliance from films like XX/XY and We Don't Live Here Anymore. Zodiac showed it was still there; you don't need the money from films like this anymore.",Rumor Has It...
36,fwomp,MaLaine Steals The Show ...But Even That Can't Save This Flick,3,5 June 2006,"One of the main things that helps me rate films is how memorable they are, and with RUMOR HAS IT this became a bit sticky. The conundrum comes from my extreme enjoyment of THE GRADUATE (1967), something that RUMOR HAS IT makes no small claim to being a sort of sequel to.THE GRADUATE was sexy, funny, ahead of its time, and even explicitly inappropriate. RUMOR HAS IT tries to ratchet up these areas but doesn't succeed due to poor acting, poor casting (with one exception) and a senseless script.Jennifer Aniston plays Sarah Huttinger, the granddaughter of Katherine Richelieu (Shirley MacLaine playing the aged Mrs. Robinson/Anne Bancroft), and she soon discovers that the women in her family have a ""thing"" for Beau Burroughs (Kevin Costner playing an middle-aged Benjamin Braddock/Dustin Hoffman). Sarah (Aniston) is engaged to be married but something inside her makes her hesitate before heading to the alter. She doesn't act or look anything like anyone in her family and she feels that maybe she was adopted. Her mother died years ago and can't give her any answers, so she goes to see Grandma Katherine (MacLaine) to see if she has any. A pandora's box of information suddenly gushes forth as Sarah learns her family was the basis for the book and film, The Graduate. She also learns that Beau (Costner) may be her father, since her mother also slept with him right before Sarah's mother and father were married.Coming to terms with the fact that Beau isn't her father is both tough and touching (one of the few truly memorable moments of the movie.) But RUMOR HAS IT just isn't that engaging. It's not nearly as sexy as THE GRADUATE was and it's not nearly as funny, either. The film makers try to ""shock"" the audience by having Sarah and Beau sleep together while the true nature of Sarah's paternity remains unclear (""This isn't The Graduate, this is Deliverance!"") But the shock just doesn't take us where we need to go. It's not funny, dramatic, or even that interesting.The one exceptional portion of this movie lay with Shirley MacLaine. Stealing nearly every scene she's in, MacLaine was the epitome of a damaged woman trying to keep her granddaughter from becoming just as screwed up as she. But even her excellent performance couldn't save the film ...unfortunately. Costner and Aniston looked out of place and miscast, completely lacking any kind of true chemistry, thus making the entire film unmemorable.",Rumor Has It...
37,jpschapira,"What can, could or should we do about Rob Reiner?",6,14 April 2006,"Rumor has it that Rob Reiner has lost his touch for directing comedy a long time agoBut that's an old story. ""Rumor Has It"", the film, is (after ""Alex & Emma"") Reiner's latest directing intent for a comeback that we all now will never happen. However, George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh thought it had something going on; I'll tell you why.The movie's premise is one of the most interesting things I've witnessed in a while. Starting from an existent rumor in the city of Pasadena, the very intelligent screenwriter Ted Griffin (""Matchstick Men"", ""Ocean's eleven"") created a screenplay that goes back to ""The Graduate"" with Dustin Hoffman, the book that lead to it and the facts that lead to the book.It seems (now I'm talking about the film, which takes a lot of twists and makes us confuse fiction with reality; the film's reality) that a man named Beau Burroughs (a 50-year old, looking good and very talented Kevin Costner) was 'that' graduate (""I never actually graduated, but it looked better than ""The Dropout"", he says) and slept with the grandmother and mother of Sarah, the picture's main character.Sarah is played by Jennifer Aniston, in what's her third comedy in a row this year, after ""Bruce Almighty"" and ""Along Came Polly"". What she achieves is another well constructed character, with the comedic details that she's starting to master perfectly. I mean the tics of her character when she mumbles, the hysterical moments and other things.The story has nothing to do with the typical romantic comedy, for starters, because there's not only a main couple and if there is, it doesn't occupy the center of the plot. There's Jeff (the great Mark Ruffalo who was able to enjoy some glorious moments), Sarah's fiancée, who cares a lot for her. There's Annie (a cute Mena Suvari), Sarah's sister who has recently married her tennis partner Scott, and there's Grandma Katharine (terrific Shirley MacLaine) and Dad Earl.Earl is the third performance by Richard Jenkins I witness over the last three films I've seen; and those three films (this one, ""Fun with Dick and Jane"" and ""North Country"") are everything the actor did last year. It was a great year for the man, 2005: choosing supporting roles that mostly generate the same impact as the leads. I've said the man's talents are extensive, at the age of 52: I say it again, and I hope this year has good plans for him.Rob Reiner needs a miracle to get his career back and I'm tired of repeating it. ""Rumor Has It"" has got what it takes for a good comedy, but is not able to exploit it; not even with the writing talents of Griffin and its A-List cast. It was probably Reiner's fault.",Rumor Has It...

None of the characters are worth rooting for (except nice guy Ruffalo), they are mostly bad-taste people who're drenched in sense and sensibility belonging in a land far, far away - it's as if Aniston still lives in the world of 'Friends', where anything close to reality are far and few between. I get the fact that romantic films may be living in a semi-fantasy to get you just in that particular mood, but when every little piece is placed so terribly wrong as it is here, you just have to neglect it.

Given that he had an affair with Katharine Richelieu, played admirably well by Shirley MacLaine, the character depicted by Anne Bancroft (Mrs. Robinson) in The Graduate, as well as a one night stand with MacLaine's daughter (deceased in this follow-up), it is a twisted premise, be it a delightful one, that has Costner now have a one night stand with Sarah Huttinger (Jennifer Aniston) the third generation woman of that dysfunctional family, to have her way with him. I liked the concept well enough to watch the movie.Thanks to the performances of Shirley MacLaine and Kathy Bates, I did not feel hostile toward the movie.

Sarah learns that her mother spent the week before marrying her dad in Mexico with a Beau Burroughs (Kevin Costner)who is supposedly the real Banjamin Braddock and thinks he might be her biological father. OK, the plot is a little far-fetched but Rob Reiner's breezy direction and the smart and charismatic performance from Jennifer Aniston make this improbable story more than watchable. Costner's easy going charm perfectly inhabits the role of Beau Burroughs and Shirley MacLaine steals every scene she's in as Sarah's grandma. MacLaine can play this kind of role in her sleep by now but she never fails to command the screen and garner big laughs. Richard Jenkins, Mark Ruffalo, Mena Suvari, and Kathy Bates round out this first rate cast as Sarah's father, fiancée, sister, and aunt, respectively.

Now that she's free of that TV show, she can make many, many great movies in the years to come. As you watch her on screen, you also realise she has a quality that will 'wear' very well. Imagine her at age 45, or 55! Or even at 65, she'll still be a charmer.Kevin Costner was also great--- he has a gravitas about him that is appealing. I sort of liked his wacky period with Waterworld and The Postman, but this seems to be more his element. Likable, etc.The rest of the cast was great, too. Mark Rufalo is one of those guys that I can never quite place when I hear his name. But when I see him, I feel like he's a bud.

Sarah searches for the truth and becomes an addition to the tale.(Comment) This is a cute chick-flick that took one of the great movies of the 1960's and continued the story. There are some great lines in the movie, like the toast Shirley MacLaine gave to the bride and groom, ""Life is short, and marriage is long, so drink to make it go by faster."" Shirley shines in this light-hearted comedy. From the advertising, you may think Costner has a large part in the movie, but actually he only has a small part. The film does a nice job of putting together the rumor from the past, and the present day affair. Since I saw ""The Graduate"" when I was young, I can relate to this movie.

You think that something funny is coming and the scene ends and just isn't that laugh inducing. I wanted to laugh-but it just wasn't funny.Also, I don't know if I buy into the story. At the end of The Graduate Elaine and Ben run to the street and catch a public bus taking them from Elaine's wedding while the guests have been locked in the church by Ben.

There, she meets millionaire playboy Beau Burroughs (Kevin Costner) who had relations with both her mother and grandmother, an incident that might have influenced the '60s movie ""The Graduate."" ""Rumor Has It"" is a lackluster film from Jennifer Aniston that fails to take advantage of its interesting premise. The movie had all the right ingredients to be an entertaining ride. Good cast, good director, engaging premise and a talented screenwriter. So, what went wrong? Rob Reiner tried to make a character driven dramedy that just didn't work. The film was not very funny and they recycled the same jokes over and over again. How many jokes about Pasadena can you have in the first twenty minutes? Apparently not enough for Mr. Reiner. The more serious scenes were deathly dull and this has a lot to do with the fact that all the characters were unlikable and uninteresting. The actors all appeared bored on screen and only one person gave a good performance.Shirley MacLaine gives an engaging and funny performance as Katherine. She saves the movie completely though she doesn't get a lot of screen time. Jennifer Anniston was pretty bland, nothing special from her. That is two flops in a row for her with this and Derailed. Mark Ruffalo was okay, again nothing special. Mena Suvari gave a decent performance but doesn't get a lot of screen time. Kevin Costner was a complete dud. His performance was very mundane and he shared zero chemistry with everyone on screen.The appeal between Costner and Aniston seemed force and there was nothing interesting about it at all. The scenes with Aniston and Ruffalo were much better and seemed more real. The family aspects of the movie were okay. There were a few engaging scenes like the bedroom scene between Aniston and Suvari. Those two played sisters and their conversation about their mother was nice to watch. Still, they weren't as good as Cameron Diaz and Toni Collette from ""In Her Shoes"". The ending was expected and a little unbelievable actually.

So you know it has to be really really bad in order for me to love the lead lady so much and yet find the movie thoroughly unbearable. This movie tries to buy some street cred by linking it's plot to a Simon and Garfunkle song and a movie starring Dustin Hoffman, but the caliber of this movie is not even in the same galaxy as those media offerings-The Graduate and the song Mrs. Robinson.Jenny seems like she was given a bit too much leeway to just ape her character on Friends and she wasn't really challenged at all with this fluffball. While you can sit through this, just be prepared to be perpetually let down with a good scene setup followed by a stale anticlimax.Jennifer's detective work is also painful to behold, I wish she could have found a better plot to play with, this uncomfortable and clumsy tie in to the whole concept of ""Mrs. Robinson"" and The Graduate is like handing someone a pretzel that is one twist of dough and one twist of poo.

51,bobbobwhite,Far fetched would be an understatement,5,2 February 2008,"Does Hollywood do this dumb stuff on purpose? It casts bankable stars and then sees how preposterous a premise it can come up with, and then tries to fly it past us as a ""hilarious comedy""? Give us a break, and some credit for a having a brain. A rich guy slept with the girl's mother, grandmother and her over the course of almost 40 years? Jeez! Yeah, you got me again Hollywood, I bought it! That could happen, sure.The only thing good about this film was Aniston and Shirley Maclaine. Maclaine is making a huge second career out of playing an old gal who used to be a babe who now only has tons of nasty zingers for anyone she thinks deserves them, which is everyone. Jennifer Aniston played her granddaughter....what a cutie, about the cutest girl in Hollywood, and has a terrific and toned figure to boot.(What guy would prefer Anna Nicole Smith-type women when Jennifer is so much more appealing, to me at least, and has a brain to go along with it.) And Jennifer is so naturally talented in comedy as to almost make this film work, along with great work from the always terrific Maclaine.Anyway, this was a pretty dumb story about how Aniston finds out if Costner's character is her real father, as he slept with her mother a week before her mom's wedding and Jen's character was born about 8+ months later. She was also in doubt about marriage and kept her fiancé in constant flux about when and if their marriage was ever going to happen.The preposterous casting of Kevin Costner as the sexy, rich guy who got all 3 babes was just for box office appeal, not for good casting. I see Costner as so laid back it seems he is always on the edge of falling asleep, so it takes the right kind of role and movie for him to be better. This was not it. No chemistry at all between him and Jennifer but she tried hard in her funny, quirky way to make it all work. Mark Ruffalo, as her fiancé-in-waiting, was also miscast and might be miscast in any comedy, as his brooding looks and manner are surely better for drama. I didn't think Mark and Jennifer had great chemistry either. The whole thing just didn't work well except for the funny interchanges between Jennifer and her grandmother(Shirley), as they were by far the best things in it.

52,nomoons11,Not a badly made film...but wow....totally beyond unbelievable situation and circumstance this film portrays,4,5 June 2012,"First off, this film is very well cast. First rate and the film itself is well made and has good production values. No doubt about it. That being said, the premise they provide with this story is so ridiculous, it defies morality or logic or whatever words that are similar in theme that I can't quite think of at the moment.Whenever I come upon a film Jeniffer Aniston does that I haven't seen or heard of, I usually get it cause I really like the little ""niche"" she's carved herself in the romantic comedy world. She usually fits the bill every time. After finishing this, I figured the only reason she did this one was to be in a film involved with Shirley MacLaine and Kevin Costner.So I guess I have to get to my point in why this film so didn't work for me. It came down to what the story portrayed and would this happen in reality. The answer is a massive no way on planet earth. Now obviously this is suppose to be entertainment but as I've mentioned in a few of my reviews, I try to see some reality in films so I sit back and think would any of this happen in real life.The basic premise of this film is that a girl, who's going to be getting married soon, flies back to her California home to attend her sister's wedding. All the while we notice that she seems a bit confused or off. She seems to think that she's not part of her family because she doesn't act like em or have any of the same interests as them. Not long after she arrives she finds out from dear ole grandma that her life, along with her mother's and her grandmothers, are the premise for the book..and film...The Graduate. From this she deduces that she's actually not part of the family, she has a different father than she thinks. So this would explain everything for except one problem. She goes and finds her would be father and right off the bat he tells here that he can't have children. There goes that theory of hers. So she's just confused in general about life.If you know the Graduate you know that the protagonist sleeps with the mother and the daughter. In this film, we get to jump a generation. The mother dies early on in her life and what we have left is the grandmother and the grand daughter. And as you would surmise, when she finds her ""almost"" father and gets informed that she's not his daughter...he sleeps with her to. Now this is from a girl who's soon to be husband loves her to tears and she supposedly loves him but is just so confused she goes ahead and completes the cycle. He sleeps with the grandmother, the daughter and now the grand daughter. Is it me or is some morality just lost in films these days? The real funny part is that Kevin Costner has always been a fairly attractive guy, but for a balding/thin haired 54 year old guy with a gut starting to show getting a beautiful girl that's 33 years old is just ridiculous to the point of...gimme a break.The painful part of this is her soon to be husband finally goes back to find his future wife and finds her kissing ole daddy Costner. From this, any normal guy would just end it and move on. Her constant I'm confused and I didn't know what I was doing attitude answer she gives him would get old quick. You'd walk out right? Wrong, in this film he forgives her and the live happily ever after.In reality folks, the end take in this film would never happen. I was really not happy after seeing this. With all the star power in this and they end the film on a moral low ground with no negative consequences this girl should suffer was just not acceptable to me. I'm not holier than than thou but this was just a terrible film.For a film that's suppose to be a romantic comedy, it sure left out the comedy and gave me a bad feeling in my stomach on how Hollywood picks these scripts. Where have the good romantic comedy script writers gone?",Rumor Has It...
53,Pookyiscute,Eh...,5,16 September 2006,"There are few films anymore, that will make you laugh aloud, and still want you to watch it again at a later time...this is not one such film. Although it will make you laugh aloud, from time to time, it won't make you want to ever watch it again. A few funny lines, really can't save a bad movie. The writing by the way, isn't even all that good, and Jennifer Aniston and Mark Ruffalo have absolutely zero chemistry together, starting the film off as an engaged couple.I found Jennifer Aniston to have been very badly miscast, and though she did present a few moments of comical and well timed lines, she really was drab in the film, and added nothing. Mark Ruffalo was perfect in his character, and I have to say that every film I see him in, I like him more and more. I think he's an awesome actor, that really doesn't not get nearly enough coverage in the media. But, maybe that's the way he likes it.Kevin Costner was funny, and I think the best character in the whole film, aside from Mark Ruffalo's, was that of Shirley MaClaine's. She delivered her lines almost as well and right on as her facial expressions. She is a professional, that no one can mess with, and I have to say that I enjoyed the scenes with her the most. I think she should have been more of the movie (maybe more than Jennifer Aniston).The film itself is a bit boring. And, come on...very unrealistic. The plot, is that Aniston's character figures out her family is the basis for the book, and later the movie, ""The Graduate"". That her grandmother (MaClaine) is Mrs. Robinson. And, that her mother, had an affair with Costner's character (Dustin Hoffman's character in 'The Graduate'), before Aniston's character was born. It's a bit confusing in writing, in the movie it makes more sense, though again it's not at all realistic, and sometimes you need a bit of realism to help you go along with a story as ridiculous as this one was.There were some funny moments, and some great lines, but again, that can't be enough to carry a movie, of this sort. It had to have been funny the whole way through, which it just wasn't But, if you're in the mood for something silly, stupid and really pointless...then hear ya go.

They have no idea about life, art or the world outside the studio and pampered existence they undeservedly enjoy.

55,anhedonia,'Rumor' has no humor,1,27 May 2006,"The truth about ""Rumor"" - it stinks.How could a film with such an enticing premise and talented cast go so horribly awry?When I first heard the idea for ""Rumor Has It...,"" I thought what an interesting concept: A newly-engaged young woman, Sarah Huttinger (Jennifer Aniston), comes to Pasadena, Calif., for her sister Annie's (Mena Suvari) wedding and realizes her family was the inspiration for Charles Webb's novel, ""The Graduate,"" which Mike Nichols turned into a landmark film in 1967.In addition to Aniston and Suvari, you toss in Shirley MacLaine (as the potential Mrs. Robinson), Mark Ruffalo, Richard Jenkins, Kathy Bates and, of course, Kevin Costner (as Benjamin Braddock all grown up).So why does ""Rumor Has It..."" stink?Because it just isn't funny. It's flat, tepid, utterly devoid of even the slightest hint of humor.I've no idea whether this is because writer Ted Griffin was fired as director and Rob Reiner, who hasn't made a good film in ages, was brought in to direct. Honestly, I thought Reiner hit his nadir in 1999 with ""The Story of Us."" But then he followed that four years later with the execrable ""Alex & Emmma."" Surely, that was his nadir. Nope. Apparently, he could sink lower and he proves it with ""Rumor Has It..."" Beau Burroughs is the kind of role Costner should revel in. Yet, he's completely dull. There's no sparkle in Costner's performance, the glint in his eye is gone. Compare this rotten turn with his wonderful performance in ""The Upside of Anger"" (2005) and you'll realize how brilliant he could have been.Aniston tries incredibly hard to salvage something out of her lead role. But - and I don't know whether this is Griffin's fault because I've no idea how much of his script wound up in the final cut - poor Sarah gets nothing funny to say and even fewer funny things to do. As far as Reiner seems to be concerned, this is a serious role. The talented Ruffalo gets a thankless role as Sarah's woeful fiancé, Jeff; and Suvari turns up in a role that is completely unnecessary. Why is Anna even in this picture other than to give Sarah a reason to come to Pasadena? MacLaine gives yet another performance we expect from her in a role that she can now play in her sleep. This time it's the boozy, yet no-nonsense, grandmother. Blink and you'll miss Bates.The film's only believable character is Earl Huttinger, Sarah's dad, played superbly by Jenkins. There doesn't seem anything fake about Jenkins' performance - then again, there never is - and the scene between Earl and Sarah in the kitchen is the film's only highlight. You never doubt for an instant that Earl is a man who deeply loves his children.It's a shame that ""Rumor Has It..."" turned into such a fiasco.

It's obvious that Reiner desperately wants the audience to be shedding tears by this point, but unless you're the most overly sensitive of the sensitive then much like Aniston attempting a crying scene, the tears will never come.Speaking of Aniston's crying, well, that's just something I always notice in movies these days. If you're going to cry then SHOW SOME TEARS! Aniston's method consists of scrunching up her face and making that wailing sound she used to make as Rachel on ""Friends."" She's cute and charming enough, but she never convinced me of her character's struggles.Perhaps if you're a fan of reincarnation advocate, Shirley MacLaine, then you'll like this more than I did. I failed to crack a smile at such lines as ""I'll put on a pot of bourbon,"" but about half of the audience howled with maniacal laughter. Whatever tickles your fancy, I suppose.I am curious about one thing, and this question goes out to Mark Ruffalo - Mark, why is every single movie you're in these days some sort of Romantic Comedy or Romantic Dramedy? Come on, you're a cool guy, it's time to branch out and embrace a few more genres. Ever heard of ""typecast""? Hopefully your role in the new Zodiac killer movie will do the trick.Anyway, ""Rumor Has It"" isn't a bad movie, and I will readily admit (has anyone ever ""unreadily"" admitted anything?) that fans of girly dramas might enjoy this more than manly man Betts here, but I see no compelling reason to suggest you pay monstrous prices to see it at the theater. Rumor has it that it'll play just fine on your home entertainment center. *ahem* My apologies.",Rumor Has It...

Here's the beef: this movie has funny parts to it, and the plot has some promise, but I just didn't feel like it was a funny movie! To place a plot from a thirty-year-old movie inside this one has the makings of a fantastic film, but I just don't feel like the actors pulled it off in this one.If you're looking to kill some time, watch the movie, but if you're looking to save some money, wait for it to come out on DVD!",Rumor Has It...
62,oshram-3,Graduate fanfic,3,27 December 2006,"There's an old Saturday Night Live sketch from the 70s when Buck Henry used to hang around the studio a lot where he's pitching a sequel to The Graduate. They milked it for laughs almost thirty years ago because then, Henry and co. knew such an idea was dreadful. Unfortunately, Hollywood has never heard an idea so awful that it had to say no (Kazaam, anyone?), and thus, we have this movie.Rumor Has It purports to tell the true story of the Robinson family from The Graduate, telling us up front that the book was based on a real life event, and that all of Pasadena always wanted to know who it really was about. We fast forward thirty years (from the movie) to 1997, where obit writer Sarah (Jennifer Aniston) begins to suspect that the family in question might be hers. Joining her for this ride into nostalgia is Beau Burroughs (Kevin Costner), allegedly the 'Dustin Hoffman' character, and Aunt Mitzi (Shirley MacLaine), supposedly 'Mrs. Robinson.' One of my cardinal rules about cinema is that you never invoke a better movie during your own, because the audience will invariably begin to make comparisons, and unless you're really good, your film will come up short. Well, Rumor Has It isn't very good; it's more very confused. When Sarah starts getting interested in Beau, we have the unlikely scenario of a third generation of a woman in the same family shtupping the same guy, and frankly  well, the whole damn thing plays like some adolescent Graduate fanfic, where a girl who was young at the time of the movie finally gets to consummate her schoolgirl crush on Dustin Hoffman. Sure, there's some pablum thrown in about relationships, and the typical Hollywood happy ending (come on, it's a Rob Reiner film, you know how it will end anyway), but most of the film just comes off as a) weird and b) obsessed, like any fanfic, with its source material, in this case, again, The Graduate.Costner actually does a decent job here in a thoroughly thankless role, having to play the older, grayer version of a beloved cinematic character (he gets one great line, ""I dropped out of college, but I don't think The Drop Out would have been as good a title.""). Costner displays enough charm that you can believe a woman looking like Jennifer Aniston could fall for him, and he does the best one can with, as I said, a thankless role. Shirley MacLaine is extremely funny as the acerbic old aunt who's still mad at him three decades later, and whenever she's around, the movie gets a lot more fun. But a lot of the weight of this mess rests on Aniston's shoulders, and while I find her to be a good actress, she can't salvage this mess. It doesn't help that she's playing a minor variation of her usual 'confused woman who just can't quite get her life sorted out'  an extended riff on Rachel Green, really  which is a shame, because when she deviates from formula she's usually pretty good. Here she's more impressive as set dressing than as an actor, and for someone with her chops (The Good Girl, Bruce Almighty, etc.), that's a shame.Obviously you can give this one a pass, unless you just really love one of the leads (and I like Costner about as much as anyone anymore, seeing how all of Hollywood pretty much reviles him for no good reason). Rumor Has It is just a big old mess, and you have to be very forgiving  or as enraptured by The Graduate as the filmmakers were  to really enjoy it.",Rumor Has It...

Sarah wonders if Burroughs is her real father.After a couple clumsy, non-funny attempts at humor (Sarah and Jeff attempt sex in an airplane bathroom; Sarah's father has a silly game to hold one's breath while driving thru tunnels), the movie yawns to the opening. The only time I laughed was when Sarah's father feints kicking Beau in the family jewels as he really did in a high school game when they were kids. Other than that, there was no humor in here. So much for comedy. No good lines either although Sarah's grandmother, Shirley MacLane, does try.One would think that with all the star power available, the script would have more punch in it. Jennifer Anniston must have a face coach. She grimaces, twists and contorts her face way too much as if to convey the real meaning of her actions just in case you miss them. But, the face moves aside she does an acceptable job as do the rest of the cast. There is just nothing anyone can do with this script. It should have been better.

64,saarvardi,"This project had so much more potential in it, with all the wonderful talents involved, yet the result is just.... well, underwhelming",5,25 December 2005,"After being extremely overdosed by this season's share of romantic comedies, which included let-downs like Elizabthtown, cute but useless cinematic efforts such as Prime and In Her Shoes, and fun kitsch in the shape of Just Like Heaven, I didn't really know what to expect walking into Rumor Has It. On the outside, it had all the ingredients it required to make it a big comedic stomp to end 2005 properly: legendary director Rob Reiner was at the helm, after giving the world one of film's biggest rom-coms in the shape of When Harry Met Sally; Friends star Jennifer Aniston was at the lead; supporting rolls included proved talents in the likes of Shirlie MacLaine (Academy Award winner for Terms of Endearment), Kevin Kostner (Academy Award winner for Dances with Wolves) and even the oh so cute Mena Suvari (American Beauty). I was even about to forgive the film for it's arrogant use of the washed up Mark Ruffalo (View from the Top, 13 Going on 30, and just about every other romantic comedy you can possibly think of); once I found out it deals with the biggest no-no taboo of them all - American icon film The Graduate (1967). Alas, I found myself just remotely connected with the characters, hardly laughed throughout the film, and walked away thinking just how this could have been a much, much better movie, if executed properly.Rumor Has It deals with the family dynasty of the true people that allegedly stood behind the characters of 1967's The Graduate. That film showed now veteran actor Dustin Hoffman as a young college graduate, being seduced by a lusty friend of his family, the 40-something year old foxy Mrs. Robinson (portrayed by the late Anne Bancroft). It pointed out the free spirit atmosphere of the 60's, much with the help of the widely praised Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack, which included timeless hits like Mrs. Robinson and The Sound of Silence. Rumor Has It, which takes place in 1997, introduces us with the 34-year-old Sarah Huttinger (Aniston), the granddaughter of the famous Mrs. Robinson, now a wise yet still hip 70-something year old (portrayed by MacLaine this time around). Huttinger flies home to Pasedina to take part in her younger sister's wedding (Suvari), along with her fiancé, Jeff (Rufalo). She is in her mid 30's, and not getting younger, yet she still hasn't found her place in the world. During the wedding ceremony, she finds out her grandmother, Katharine Richelieu, is in fact the true Mrs. Robinson (a secret that was kept well for over three decades) and that her mother also had an affair with the young graduate, Benjamin Braddock, whose actual name is Beau Burroughs (Kostner). In the spirit of the doubtful generation of the young adults in the 90's and 00's, Huttinger starts doubting her origins, convincing herself she is the long lost daughter of the charming Burroughs, and leaves her fiancé and family in pursuit of her alleged father, only to be tangled up in his charms as well. The plot, although trying to be witty and it's numerous attempts at implying iconic American gestures of the last decade, turns out to be exhausting instead. The character study is weak and unconvincing, the general atmosphere is cute but somewhat overshadowed by the confusing twisting of the plot; and the songs, which in the original are strong and effective, turn out to be utterly forgettable and disappointing.I really tried to like this film, and I have to admit I caught myself smiling here and there, but all in all this project had so much more potential in it, with all the wonderful talents involved, yet the result is just.... well, underwhelming.",Rumor Has It...
65,Thorsten-Krings,Yawn...,1,15 May 2007,"This has to be the greatest artistic failure ever. Take the idea: the story of The Graduate really happened and we see the real life Rbinsons 30 odd years later. Can you go wrong with that plot? Amazingly it's possible. The film is incredibly boring. It tethers uncertainly between a serious love story and a comedy. None of the elements work. It's not romantic, it's not funny and it's tedious. Besides I find the idea of sleeping with someone who had sex with your granny< somewhat off putting. The only good scenes are really the ones that have Shirley Maclane in them. She certainly does steal the show. I think these days if you watch a film with Kevin Costner it's a sign that the screenplay is bad.",Rumor Has It...
66,cdelacroix1,"Fast-Paced, Funny, & Very Cool Movie!",8,26 December 2005,"I really enjoyed this movie VERY much, at several levels ... most of all, of course, as a comedy.The comedy was almost non-stop without becoming tiresome at all. This is thanks especially to the outstanding script. In a movie that invokes Casablanca several times, the same high quality, fast-paced, witty, funny script was much in evidence. This movie was full of hilarious, memorable clever one-liners that I'm much tempted to give away, but I won't ... think of some of the mordant, crisp humor in Casablanca and you'll have an idea of what this movie offers. Of course, although this movie invokes Casablanca, it's really big cinematic tribute is to The Graduate. And a worthy tribute it is .. with the same quirky, humorous, and often times deeply touching features of earlier movie. Of course, Rumor Has It includes as its central motif a representation of itself as an update-of, and fill-in-the blanks-of, a real-life story on which The Graduate was putatively based. Casablanca is a sub-motif and is unequivocally viewed as fictitious in Rumor Has It. To me this whole menage is very appealing: in which themes like How Life Is Like a Movie, and How Life Is Not Like a Movie, and how Fiction is connected to Reality and vice versa, and how Memory is connected to Reality and vice versa. Life is a Stage is a very old idea and it receives really light and humorous and sometimes thought-provoking treatment in this movie.The acting was wonderful. Jennifer Aniston (Sarah Huttinger) was, it's true, a sort of ur-Rachel from Friends; but with more range. I sure have no problem with a Rachel-like persona on this screen: what a wonderful and delightful persona, and Aniston does it flawlessly. Plus her acting is given plenty of opportunity to to range that to me was really very effective: witness her deft handling of the morning-after scene ... but I won't give it away! Kevin Costner (Beau Burroughs) was a smooth and credible and likable Man from the Past. Mark Ruffalo (Jeff Daly) was a good Solid Guy, whose name, behavior, talk, etc all contrast sharply with that of Costner, while keeping both characters likable and appealing. But my own very favorite part was that of Shirley MacLaine (Katharine Richelieu): an extraordinary actress with a wonderful script who knows how to bring it to life with a level of humor and credibility and likability that was simply spot-on throughout ... with the possible exception of one scene while dancing with Ruffalo among the closing credits. But that was the exception: to put on this amazing ""harridan"" persona, executing it with crispness and authority and (except for that one item) without over-acting, made this a plain delightful role. There is even a place when she looks in a mirror and briefly, briefly, gives us a look that could have been straight out of her justly famous ""Irma la Douce persona in yet another film from long, long ago. And believe me, in context this felt not at all anachronistic, but rather yet another part of the Old Movie - Present Reality motif that provided such rich material in this movie. And frankly, I smiled *every* time that MacLaine showed up on the screen.It occurs to me that the above might seem to make the movie sound ""heavy"". It sure wasn't, at all, not for me at least. The movie just moved like gangbusters, sparkling with comedy and providing everything seemingly on cue with a delightful delivery. One scene that to me could almost sum up the pace and the wit and the characterizations: a wonderful scene in which Huttinger and her grandmother in one house, on the phone with her father and her newly married sister in another house. I won't say anything more, except: watch for it, it's amazing and it's funny and it's touching all at once.",Rumor Has It...

68,mcsheehey,Good Premise + Bad Screenplay = Sub-Par Comedy,4,7 June 2007,"The idea for ""Rumor Has It"" was a very good one. Basically, it's advertised as one woman's revelation that her family inspired ""The Graduate."" Big names such as Jen Anniston, Kevin Costner, Mark Ruffalo, and Shirley Maclaine were advertised along with the premise, so it seemed like a sure-fire hit. It isn't in reality.The core problem with ""Rumor"" is its poor execution of its own premise and its inability to deliver what we as an audience really want. It delivers a ridiculously far-fetched plot about Sarah (Anniston), a thirty-year-old woman who suddenly realizes that her grandmother (Shirley Maclaine) is the Mrs.Robinson of ""The Graduate."" This leads her to find the Dustin Hoffman character to be an older wealthy man 9Kevin Costner) and the Katherine Ross character to be her mother. At the same time, history begins to repeat itself in some ""shocking"" ways, which become increasingly predictable. This comedy could have worked as a playful and silly romp, but the director and screenwriters try too hard to ground the characters in reality and make it all very serious. They in fact do the opposite, producing a far-fetched and ridiculous plot line that no one could possible save.Unlike ""The Graduate,"" ""Rumor Has It"" is just another run-of-the-mill romantic comedy. Like ""The Graduate"" however, ""Rumor"" has a great cast. Anniston is very convincing in her role as Sarah, though she's not incredibly likable for a time in the film. Shirley Maclaine is the show-stealer as ""Mrs. Robinson."" Unfortunately, we end up spending too little time with her character. I was hoping that a romance would spark between her and Sarah's husband, so that history would truly repeat itself. no such luck. Costner and Ruffalo do fine in their roles, though I didn't really sympathize with either character. In the end, ""Ruor has It"" has very little except for a nice fleeting idea and a good cast. It's forgettable and will probably end up in the bargain bin at Blockbuster within a year.",Rumor Has It...
69,Movieguy_blogs_com,It is fairly predictable and short on laughs.,4,28 December 2005,"In this movie, the book from which 'The Graduate' was made into a movie and rumor has it that it was based upon true events in a Pasadena community.

Will Sarah follow in the footsteps of her mother and grandmother when she meets Beau Burroughs (Kevin Costner), aka 'Benjamin Braddock'? 'Rumor Has It...' is a pseudo-sequel to the 1967 movie 'The Graduate'. This quirky tale is about Jennifer Aniston discovering a long lost family secret that has an unpredictable effect on her. This all happens right after she has accepted a wedding proposal from her boyfriend Mark Ruffalo and after her younger sister, Mena Suvari, has just been married. It is all to the dismay of her grandmother, Shirley MacLaine, who is the true life of this movie. She is great as the infamous 'Mrs. Robinson'. However, I cannot say the rest of the movie was that great. It is fairly predictable and short on laughs.",Rumor Has It...
70,winopaul,Half-decent chick flick,5,4 December 2010,"OK there was this cute premise to tie it into The Graduate story arc-- and Shirley McClain actually had some good lines, proving she should spend more time acting and less channeling space aliens or whatever. Another thing-- I am tired of people ragging on Jenny Aniston about not being able to act. Just because she plays a character you don't like or feel empathy for, does not mean she is a bad actress, au contraire, it shows she is a good actress. We would all be delighted to meet her in an airplane or a Knicks game, so making me hate her like in this movie shows she can act. I did not watch any TV from 1980 to 2004 so Jennifer Aniston does not have any residual character baggage (RCB) with me. I have seen maybe 4 minutes of her in Friends, and I really did not like that character anyway. But please, no one can say she is a bad actress, that is BS. Maybe you like her other characters better or have had more time to get to know them, but that is your fault, not hers.Every man, especially young men, should watch this movie to try and get some understanding of how women think. It is easy to be misogynist and say that Aniston's character is a ding-bat airhead that does not know what she wants. That was the problem with this movie. All it did was look at the situation from a very female perspective. I don't think you could call me sexist when I say that men tend too think dry and technical and logical and analytical and women think intuitively and inductively and in parallel. By combining the logical and intuitive thinking modes in the form of a couple, especially a married couple, you get more than the sum of its parts. This logical/intuitive dichotomy is not a firm rule, just a tendency. Some women are logical and some guys are intuitive. We should all strive to be good at both types of thinking.A man looks at this movie and just can't understand what Aniston is doing. He wants her to make a dry logical choice. Depending on his experiences he thinks as weighted matrix, putting relative values on Cosner's being rich, but not being able to father kids, the boyfriend as being younger etc etc etc. Sorry guys, women don't have to suffer through all that tedium. They stir it around in their heads for a while and then they just get the right answer. We can't follow their thinking, but it is stupid to not realize that is what is going on. So to a women watching this film, they are just absorbing it all and they understand that she is trying to decide who her life partner is. But when men watch this movie they just think she has short-circuited and is acting crazy. And there is a little contempt for men in the script-- I mean how convenient that Aniston can sleep around on her engagement but it is not really cheating? So this female-tilted thinking, with no regard for logical thinking is what throws half of the market away-- men just are not going to like or understand this movie. Once again, that is not absolute-- some will but most won't. So all in all, it has a cleaver dramatic premise, the way Slumdog millionaire has a clever way to tell a story, but the story is so much from an extreme female perspective, only women will like it, and maybe not even half of them, since I observe that women do think intuitively and logically but men are doomed to geekiness. So now we are down to what? 25% of the potential market that will even get this movie, and now you still have to have an interesting story and good character and such. I have to say, this is the only movie where I like Keven Costner, so that's and achievement right there.If only this movie could have made Aniston's character thinking and intuitive and logical all at once, but not short-circuited, well then it would have been a way better movie. Its OK to be brain-stem intuitive and its OK to be cerebral logical, but all this cerebral torment of brain stem feelings is just too much to take in a couple hours. A modern woman will think Aniston is a ditz and the men think she is a slut. That is not a formula for a good movie.",Rumor Has It...

75,scotty-37,Unoriginal and with Lots of Missed Opportunities,5,16 June 2006,"As others have commented, this is essentially a boring movie that isn't particularly original or satisfying. All the acting and direction is OK as far as it goes, but the thing that is really wrong is the storyline. It doesn't know what the point is or what it's trying to accomplish.I noticed the group that rated this movie the highest were 18 year old and younger women. Interestingly 45+ year old women rated it significantly lower. I interpret this to mean that younger women were more willing to buy into Jennifer Anniston's weird behavior and were sympathetic to it, while older women more often thought that the plot a was little too neat, pat, simplistic and unrealistic.*Some Spoilers Below* The most entertaining part of the film is the grandmother (who was supposed to be the same person as Mrs. Robinson in The Graduate). At least they gave her some funny lines and she's a fun character to watch. They manage to homogenize most other characters, even ones that ought to be more interesting, like Mina Suvari's as the younger sister who is having doubts about her marriage.There are oil-tanker sized boatloads of missed opportunities for jokes and dramatic or comedic conflict. They don't capitalize well on many jokes relating to events from The Graduate, for one thing. The Graduate is mostly used as backdrop. Maybe they figured that many audience members were too stupid or too young to understand jokes relating on The Graduate, so it seems they only threw in a couple of relatively unfunny things relating to it.The time period for this movie isn't shown well aside from having people carry large cell phones. You get the idea that it's supposed to take place between 1995 and 1997 or so, but it just looks like today's world. Yeah, it wasn't that long ago, but when you actually look at things like news footage and movies from that time, styles and other things have changed a noticeable amount.I wasn't quite sure what the movie wanted me to think about Kevin Costner's character. He seems nice enough for most of the time if maybe a little messed up, but then turns narcissistic in one scene out of nowhere, ""Tell me I'm great. Tell me I'm sexy"" or something like that. There is no clear perspective to look at him with, and the script misses lots of opportunities to play with the idea that he might be Jennifer Anniston's father. The script writers seem to have self censored or been wary of playing with the idea of this taboo in any real way. I'm sure it's tricky, but if you're going to bring up the taboo, you need to create a little more doubt in order to get anyone's interest. It's resolved almost immediately when he tells her he is sterile almost on first meeting. Yeah, they try to cast *some* doubt, but it seems a halfhearted attempt and I couldn't take it seriously.I have doubts that tacking a ""happy ending"" on was the right thing to do. I actually would've liked it better if Jennifer Anniston's nice-guy fiancée had told her to get lost and stuck with it, rather than acting spineless in the end. Other movies such as ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" have successfully pulled off the non-happy ending and this movie would have been better off without it. I understand wanting the happy ending, but sometimes it's nice for a character to take a stand and be something besides a pasteurized, processed wimp.There are some moments of overwhelming cheese here. Everyone I saw it with rolled their eyes when the dad said ""I drive slow because you're in the car."" Please. Thank you Michelin man, ""Mr. Precious Cargo."" This was over the top, and dripping with enough fake sentiment to make even sentimental people think ""I can't believe they had him say that line."" Overall, this is a very forgettable movie. It's bland, inoffensive, unmemorable and uninteresting. It's a waste of time. Maybe see it if you're bored and really can't find anything else to do, but it's really not worth bothering with if you value two hours of your time.",Rumor Has It...

I have no problems with her performance - her face is as mobile and full of expression as always, and she is still dynamite to look at - and it doesn't bother me that her character's not too likable (neither, if one thinks about it, is her character in The Good Girl). Shirley MacLaine's performance was magnificent, but Kevin Costner seems a bit lacklustre, and the basic idea, that his character, in various circumstances, sleeps with 3 generations of women is bizarre, to say the least. The sub-plot, concerning Aniston's younger sister, was not very engaging, although it yielded one splendid scene. There was a degree of sentimentality towards the end, and Aniston's character's fiancé forgave her completely with too much readiness; I feel that in 'real life' it would have taken a lot longer, even if he had come around.

80,FilmSchoolWriter,Rumor Has It... that this movie is mediocre.,4,28 May 2006,"Rumor Has It... that this movie is mediocre. It wasn't half as entertaining as I thought it would be and was only saved by the totally amusing performance by Shirley MacLaine.Rumour Has It has a *great* premise. The real Robinsons! Ingeneous! But poorly executed. I'm not really sure how it could have been done better, but I know that it could. For one, I didn't want Beau Burroughs to have any real feelings for Sarah. Once again, Kevin Costner ruined a perfectly good character for me. Shirley MacLaine was the one golden spot in the entire movie and she's a good enough reason to see it. I couldn't stop laughing at everything she did and said. She even made everyone around her do a better job in each scene (yes, even Kevin Costner).So Rumor Has It isn't all that great. I laughed the 1st time and the second time I wondered what was ever so funny. It's definitely geared toward teenage girls so I'd recommend watching it with a pack of them, I'm sure they'll find something to laugh about. 4.5/10",Rumor Has It...

82,PortugalOle7,How did that rumor get started?,8,13 March 2007,"Rumor Has It... takes an interesting premise to serve as a lead point in the story. What if The Graduate, starring Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft, was in fact based on a true story. Furthermore, what if the woman who seduced the younger man, was in fact your grandmother? And what if this man also had an affair with your mother a week before she got married to your father. Mix in the detail of your birthday being more or less nine months from their wedding day and the fact you never feel you have anything in common with the rest of your family and you have the plot line for this Rob Reiner comedy.Jennifer Aniston plays Sarah Huttinger, who while attending her younger sister's wedding for a weekend in California discovers this very secret from her grandmother, played by the comedic genius, Shirley MacLaine. As the weekend winds down Sarah just can't ignore the fact that this man who was romantically involved with her mother, can in fact be her real father. Further explaining her unattached feelings for her family and her fear of commitment with her fiancé (Ruffalo). She never makes it back to New York with her fiancé, she sets out to find the mysterious Beau Burroughs (Costner), but turns out to get more than she bargains for. When she doesn't receive the answer she wants from him, an unexpected attraction develops and Sarah is conflicted over her feelings for her fiancé and the charming Burroughs.Rob Reiner weaves a complicated tale, mixing in comedy along the way, but the film has most of its laughs at the start. It turns out to be a film about one woman discovering herself and deciding what she wants out of life. Aniston seems to play her Friends character in this film. I'm not sure I see much of a real acting job here. Costner is charming as always but in her limited screen time Shirley MacLaine steals the show. She delivers her lines with such ferocity and venom as the grandmother who is still somewhat insulted that she didn't get another shot at Costner's character. The film starts to drag a little towards the end but as a whole I thought it was a well crafted film. Certainly an original premise and has a great cast.",Rumor Has It...

Jennifer Aniston carries this film with ease, supported by several others, most notably Kevin Costner and Shirley MacLaine.

She was so good in ""The Good Girl"" But here, a sub Rachel infuriating thing. What's with her mouth? She twitches and bites her lips and represses her smiles and it's dizzying and annoying and anti-comedy. Look at Shirley MacLaine for goodness sake! Has Jennifer Aniston seen ""The Apartment""?

I haven't seen anyone else on IMDb that feels the same. Its quite disgusting for me. However i do very much like Mark Ruffalo and some of the laughs i did do out loud and it wasn't half bad at-all, the low rating is just from the unnecessary odd story.

Be grateful.This is a dreadful film; contrived and forced all the way. At best, it's B-grade actors trying to count down the minutes in an at-best D-grade fare. The story is as sickening as the fact they had the nerve to categorize this film as a comedy/romance. There are perhaps 2 or 3 short laughs in the entire span of the film. And if you like cavorting with Grandad, maybe you'd call it romance. I call it a horror film.I should have known better. Are there ANY Kevin Costner films in existence that are actually good? Jennifer Aniston acts like she is still playing her role in Friends. This proves little deviation from what she should have stuck to - television roles.If you find a bullet in the head funny, maybe you'd agree this is a comedy. It's woeful. I was intending to rate it 2 stars. But I'm not being paid by anyone and I don't see me being given any favors for doing so. So I'm giving it what it truly deserves. One star.The plot drones on and on. The monologue will want to make you put earphones in, listen to music and just pretend you're watching attentively.

90,kurt_messick,Rumours are flying...,8,31 January 2006,"Rumour has it that 'Rumor Has It' is a pretty good film. This will by no means be an Oscar contender, but as a pleasant diversion on a weekend afternoon, or possibly as a date movie (for those who still go on dates), this could be a winning movie. Jennifer Aniston, late of 'Friends', plays a role that is in many ways reminiscent of the Rachel role - she is a transplanted New Yorker, returning home to L.A. (actually, Pasadena, which becomes a running joke) with her as-yet-unannounced fiancé to attend her younger sister's wedding. We learn all of this in the first few minutes, possibly before the credits are done scrolling on the screen - the frenetic pace of 'Friends' is still here.Rumour has it that there was a family in Pasadena that the film 'The Graduate' is based upon - Sarah (Anniston) fixates upon the idea that this may be her family. She questions her grandmother (Shirley MacLaine, but don't call her grandmother), who tells of a possible affair her mother had with a playboy before her marriage (Kevin Costner, now a dot-com mega-millionaire). Sarah goes off without her fiancé in search of her mother's past, but finds a past of her own, of a sort.Lots of twists and turns in the film have the characters racing up and down the coast of California in search of the past, the future, and the truth, which ends up being both expected and unexpected in this complicated but easily-followed plot.There aren't major effects and major surprises here. The situational comedy is very much in keeping with an extended version of a comfortable television show, even with the star power of MacLaine and Costner backing Anniston up. The writing is serviceable with occasional flashes of true wit, and the pace of the film is even and pleasant. In all, this is a good film, well worth seeing for a bit of entertainment. Director Rob Reiner does have a talent for good films, and this is one of them.",Rumor Has It...

Maclaine is fine in many of her scenes but this is a rote role for her. Jenkins is the best used of the older pros. Costner is mostly a non-entity in the movie. He looks very old and unhappy in the sofa scene shortly after meeting Aniston's character but before they spend the night together. Later, their character's relationship is even more implausible than the first physical meeting would suggest. Particularly given that Aniston cannot really play a 30 year old woman any longer and shouldn't. While still attractive, she cannot play someone some ten years younger than her actual age.She was completely misused and miscast in this film as she has been in nearly all of her recent films other than Along Came Polly.Not recommended at all.",Rumor Has It...

The fact that Aniston's character can even contemplate sleeping with a man who shagged her mum AND her granny is icky enough, but doing it with possibility that he might be her father still literally hovering in the air made my skin crawl. There's daddy-issues and then there's DADDY-issues apparently. Quite why Reiner decided this was a good subject for a non-black comedy though, I have no idea.As an addendum,I couldn't help wondering how - if you reversed the sexes - how utterly unacceptable the plot of this would have been.

Shirley MacLaine was a pro, though I wish she wasn't forced, as so many over-65 actors and actresses seem to be, to have filth coming out of her mouth. And I would have liked to see her more on the screen with Kevin Costner. Costner had a fine performance, even better than The Upside of Anger. He has several scenes that are just a hoot, and he had subtle moments that prevented, at least for me, the ""ick"" factor that so many critics seem to have seen. Maybe we didn't see the same movie.

96,Professr-4,Reiner's Had It,1,12 December 2005,"Remember Rob Reiner? He directed ""Spinal Tap,"" a classic of American comedy. Now, that owed as much to the improvised performances of the leads and some notable spear-carriers, but still and all, it was terrific and Mr. Reiner gets full credit for directing it. And he did ""When Harry Met Sally,"" which again owed much to the chemistry of the leads, but it is indeed a gem of a romantic comedy. ""Misery"" and ""A Few Good Men"" and ""Princess Bride"" followed, and all of a sudden, you gotta say, ""Wow, look at the track record of this guy!"" Then there was a disaster called ""North,"" and maybe that's where it all fell apart. He came back with ""American President,"" which has little to say for itself except as a quasi-pilot for ""West Wing,"" and then out-and-out bombs ""Story of Us"" and ""Alex and Emma."" Which brings us to ""Rumor Has It,"" a movie that is bad in so many ways, it's hard to know where to begin. But first, you have to accept the premise that Benjamin Braddock from ""The Graduate"" grew up to be a jet-setting, womanizing business genius; that the elegant, controlled, tightly wrapped Mrs. Robinson aged into a round-rumped sloppy drunk given to phrases like ""Go sh*t in your hat"" and ""Go play with your dick""; and that the square piece of white-bread, Carl Smith, whose wedding to Elaine Robinson was so famously disrupted, became a helluva guy, salt-of-the-earth type who loves nothing more than bass fishing, NFL football and doting on his two daughters. One of the daughters is Jennifer Aniston who is desperate to find out whether her deceased mother was ever genuinely happy because that, in the logic of this car wreck, will determine whether she will ever be genuinely happy. She also is convinced that her father is not her real father because she is SO different from him, and here are the examples she gives: 1) Her father drives slowly while she drives fast, and 2) she does not share the family fondness for playing tennis. She sets off to find her real dad (the grown-up B. Braddock, portrayed by Kevin Costner) and, having found him...engages in ""sensational"" sex with him. Yikes, the more I think about the movie, the less I like it. Check out this dialog: ""Oh, my God, it's him!"" ""Who him?"" ""HIM him!"" ""HIM him?""Tony Randall and Jack Klugman might make it work, but not Aniston and Mena Suvari.The one highlight comes near the end when Shirley MacLaine (or rather a Play-Doh mask with Shirley MacLaine's eyes) shoves Suvari out the door. The shove is clearly not in the script but rather an actual glimmer of honest emotion that crept into this compost heap and was, intentionally or not, left in the final cut by Mr. Reiner, whose current status calls to mind the sad sight of an aging Willie Mays, stumbling around the outfield in the '73 World Series, having not known when to call it quits.",Rumor Has It...

Cute though Jennifer Aniston is in the lead role, which involves her discovery that her mother and grandmother were -- or might have been -- co-participants in The Graduate, I still don't think that she can lead a film. She is too passive, too much in need of regular makeovers, to get the desired effect. Maybe if she were given a good script she would be better, because we know how devastating she could be in Friends when the writing was often white hot; but in this drivel, clumsily directed by Rob Reiner, would you believe?, she doesn't stand a chance. As for Shirly MacLaine's playing of the grandmother, who could believe that a once-great actress would allow herself to become such a gauche caricature of herself. Cringe-inducing stuff. The best came from the father, Richard Jenkins, and there was the occasional hint that Kevin Kostner, as the Dustin Hoffman character, might be worth a comeback. All of these people might have worked if there had been any staying power in the screenplay, but it petered out after 30 minutes and there was nothing but a formulaic, dreary, repetitive, over-acted, crassly sentimental rendering of the love triangle to fall back on.

98,gregorybmowery,"Blame the Scrip and Direction, Not the Actors",7,14 July 2016,"This is the second time I've seen this interesting and flawed movie. Its assets are a game and first-rate cast, all taking a fascinating premise and trying to run with it. The production is plush, with ritzy settings in Pasadena, San Francisco, etc. Everyone is groomed perfectly and dressed beautifully. And finally the premise itself should be its own best recommendation--a story that may have inspired the book and film version of THE GRADUATE, one of the most iconic films of the late 60s. So here is the bad news. Rob Reiner's pacing is very sluggish and the script really never seems to recover from it's admittedly unique story. A good ensemble cast is left stranded with the lack of directorial and written purpose. This affects Jennifer Anniston the most. There is intelligence at work here as she tries very hard to make this character make sense. We're asked to believe that she's never fit in with her family and she's very nervous coming home for her sister's wedding with her fiancé (Mark Ruffalo). Her discomfort is a little vague. Then after a talk with her saucy grandmother (Shirley MacLaine) and a further conversation with her aunt (the woefully underused (Kathy Bates, acting a little dotty--probably wondering how she got herself into such a meaningless gig), and we're off to races as Anniston pursues the man who slept with both her mother (deceased) and grandmother (Kevin Costner) for answers. Okay, enough with the spoilers. Anniston isn't at fault here. She's been dull in a slew of silly and flat movies. But there's always something about her I want to root for. And when the part is right (such as HORRIBLE BOSSES, or even CAKE), she more than rises to the occasion. I've read here that this is an extension of Rachel, her famous TV role in FRIENDS. But Rachel and this character are nothing alike, and I don't see how she is perceived like this. Anniston has a natural grace and authority on screen to go with her beauty, but she is definitely an actress that needs a strong script and equally strong directing and she doesn't get it here. Mark Ruffalo, a normally fine actor is also wasted here. This performer needs a script. He's never been interested in superficial roles, but he's stuck with one here. As for MacLaine, she all but steals the movie in her patented fashion. And you want to see more of her and what she can do. I've also read snarky remarks about Kevin Costner--totally unjustified. After the high of DANCES WITH WOLVES and other hit movies, Kevin Costner has put together a body of work that refuses to knuckle under the avalanche of negativity he received over WATERWORLD. TIN CUP, OPEN RANGE, THE UPSIDE OF ANGER, MR. BROOKS, THE COMPANY MAN, HATFIELDS & McCOYS,, 3 DAYS TO KILL, BLACK OR WHITE, AND DRAFT DAY have showcased his ability to comfortably inhabit a wide variety of roles. It's what has made him a movie star for decades. He's excellent in this, another somewhat underwritten role. But playing an aging Lothario no matter how gracefully, is uncomfortable for some people. Still I'll add this to the many movies of his that I've enjoyed watching over and over again over the years. We're not being offered many films like this anymore. The movie business is focused on blockbusters and the audience for adult themed films with good actors has dried up. Hopefully, smaller, character-driven films with stars will come around again when viewers grow weary of nothing but bloated films with 2,3 and 4 sequel numbers attached to their titles.",Rumor Has It...

I love communists but made my bucks as a capitalist? Oh, and he's clearly a Dem, to, given his relationship with Bill Clinton. Such hypocrisy is reality in Hollywood, of course, but do we have to see it in our movies, too? Oh, what a dumb question, of course we do. The acting is okay (make that, fair) but given the plot (what plot?), what can one expect. No wonder Hollywood is loosing money with this kind of garbage being peddled. Shirley MacLain overacts (but then again, her script isn't much to work with), Kevin Costner is his usual bland self (I guess his good looks (?) is what keeps him getting movies.

Ruffalo and Costner are strong which make the movie stand-up for me. Aniston seems to be trying her best but it's early Aniston so it feels like she is the one person 'acting' in places.This is at its worst during the scenes at the ball where it felt like Anistons direction was off. It just looks like Aniston is at a bar off screen and the lead up to and first scenes at the ball are particularly incongruent, poorly directed and poorly selected. What is kept displays an Aniston who has suddenly and jarringly forgotten her character altogether until Ruffalo reappears.Not sure Aniston understands her character fully as she seems to just be throwing her different styles of acting about rather than portraying her character consistently throughout the film. She can act but I find she's particularly weak when she has to just be normal or have a casual conversation with Costner and much better when it comes to being dramatic or emotional with Ruffalo. Director should have done more to rectify this.It's this inconsistency from Aniston and the Director across the movie that takes the overall shine off the movie for me, giving us a 3stars/6.5imdb rating.",Rumor Has It...

When she suddenly jumps up in the jet and pulls her boyfriend into the weensie john to eviscerate him in the bathroom bowl, it's insulting to the viewer. Makes no sense and is visual trivia. She announced to Costner: ""I have to pee."" Wow. Isn't this hilarious? Nope, it fell flat and it wasn't real and it did not transport us into another reality like a really good movie does, where you lose yourself and your very circulation changes and when you leave the theater you breathe and walk differently! Shirley MacLaine is being wasted in these roles where she struts about cockily as the older woman, wearing nifty suits, seeming impervious, cracking one-liners. I am so angry at the roles she's put in. She is capable of doing transcendent acting and her intelligence will, with the right script, lift us all into the nether regions and we could soar! And what do they use her for? These wisecracking grandma roles. Kevin Costner is very watchable, but, hey, the romance between him and Aniston develops practically in minutes and isn't likely, given the circumstances and the onus of possible incest, come on! I wanted to stifle the little sister Annie (Mena Suvari) who was getting married at the film's beginning, all that jumping and squealing, yech! Richard Jenkins is ALWAYS fine, always true blue in the acting dept. Mark Ruffalo rang true as the boyfriend, he's very good, we liked him.The highlight that gave the movie a mammoth boost was the few minutes of KATHY BATES - why didn't she have a key role?

104,dianajay,Enjoyed this Movie Very Much... Kept me laughing till the end...,8,29 December 2005,"This movie was very fun to watch. I'm not sure what so many people are complaining about. I'm glad I didn't read other peoples reviews prior to watching the movie. Of course all romantic comedies are somewhat predictable, yet they are still entertaining to watch. I thought the movie was very well cast and well acted! In fact I didn't see any need to improve on it. I watched the movie in a large theater that was nearly filled to capacity. The audience responses were all good, from laughing to cheering at times. As everyone left the theater, I heard many talking about how much they enjoyed it. Rumor Has It is a light hearted feel good kind of movie that most people will enjoy. Morally it has a few things I didn't agree with, however if you can get past that, it is very enjoyable. If you don't like ""chick flicks"" you may want to see something else, however if you like romantic comedies, this is a fun enjoyable movie and I do recommend it. I enjoyed it enough that I will purchase the DVD when it comes out.",Rumor Has It...
105,cinnamonbrandy,enjoyed the film but...,9,23 November 2007,"wish they had called it 'the postgraduate'.It's fairly grown-up humour - people who like gross-out movies are likely to walk away disappointed, and nor is it a snuggle-up-with-the-kids feel-good fest.But if you've just spent 6 days watching snuggle-up-with-the-kids feel-good fest, this should cleanse your palate nicely.I'd double-bill with 'the graduate' (well, duh!), and I suspect that this would prove two things - that 'the graduate' is the better film, and that, inmyeversohumbleopinion, that is largely because Simon and Garfunkel (genuflects) did the theme music for that one. I know it would be a copout to just steal *that* theme music for the new film - but sometimes copping out is a *good* thing, children!Helen",Rumor Has It...
106,bigtron,not a comedy as expected,5,10 January 2006,"when i watched the trailer, its made the movie out to be a comedy with a very promising and original setup. I though it more of an sophisticated version of wedding crashers & 40 YO virgin but with the same humour and fun. It had a decent cast and Jennifer aniston (a decent comedic actress). unfortunately the trailer is where all the fun ends. This movie seems to be a Jennifer aniston vehicle to transform her to a romantic actress but fails miserably. it looks like the guy cutting the preview saw the lack of chemistry between Costner and aniston and decided to trick the audience to think that it was a comedy instead of a romantic movie. Kevin Costner (whom i like and is great in a similar yet superior movie 'The upside of Anger') is much too old for Aniston and they don't have any chemistry. Jennifer is much too girlish to pair with Costner (whom had a few great parings with actress, mostly strong, older chars) This makes me afraid of what ""the breakup"" is gong to be like. Although it has Vince Vaughn and the trailer looks very funny, i worry that is may just be another 'romantic movie' for Jennifer Ansiton.",Rumor Has It...
107,TeamRockwood,Another mediocre Reiner film,4,9 January 2006,"What in God's name has happened to Rob Reiner? In the early part of his career, he was a can't-miss kind of director. From ""This Is Spinal Tap"" to ""A Few Good Men,"" his directing was infallible. And then... what? I guess someone turned off the spinal humor tap.""Rumor Has It..."" is boring. Boring, boring, boring. Romantic comedy? Ha! It's not romantic, and the packed theater I saw it in was shockingly devoid of laughter. The three big laughs the movie DID get just highlighted the fact that no one was laughing through the rest of the show. Worst of all, throughout ""Rumor Has It..."" the characters reference other movies. Every time it happens you'll think, ""Yeah...I'd rather be watching that than this."" This is a movie to avoid.",Rumor Has It...
108,GoddessofDorkness,Sex and its complications,5,9 January 2008,"Sex, sex, sex, and more sex. Flip on the TV, and what do you see? Sex! Almost every movie not created by Disney and Pixar contains at least one obligatory sex scene. I'm not saying sex is wrong or evil, but too much or too little of one thing is not good for an individual.The moral of this movie is: Don't have sex on a whim. This movie gives all the reasons why not to. In the beginning of the film, I thought it was going to be some flaky flick about sex this and sex that, but instead it used sex to make a point.Here's an instance that takes sex scenes and puts them into a more realistic perspective. In one of the beginning scenes, the couple wants to do the mile high club, and the characters find out just how cramped and unsexy it feels to do it in an airplane bathroom.The strongest example is when Jennifer's character abruptly has intercourse with the author. 1. She's married. 2. She wasn't sure if he was her father. 3. The man slept with her mother and grandmother allegedly. Sleeping with him was an obviously stupid thing to do, but since this is movie-land, having sex with someone just because they are hot is idyllic.Aniston's aftermath involved finding out the scary yet still false news that the man was her father. This temporary terror lead her into a perfect spasm that was well acted!! It was a shock like Oedipus realizing his fate except in the form of Electra. The rest of Jennifer's consequences involved facing her husband and having to tell the truth that she cheated on him. Real life is not like a James Bond movie where the alpha male of a spy lives on the edge and gets all the women - No. Real life is coming home to your spouse and dealing with the consequences at one point or another.",Rumor Has It...
109,joemjv,Very enjoyable .. deserves to be watched,10,5 May 2018,The critics are wrong again. This movie was very enjoyable. This is not the best plot in the universe but the performance and the way this movie was directed makes it quite enjoyable. Jennifer Aniston's performance was certainly amazing and I feel that no other than Shirley MacLaine and Richard Jenkins could have filled the given characters; Richard certainly knows how to make you laugh. Kevin Costner and Mark Ruffalo were really great too - the whole cast was very good. I feel this movie deserves to be watched and you will enjoy it if you take it for what it is. Definitely recommend watching for a nice evening.,Rumor Has It...

111,memnova,An inferior simulacrum,4,27 December 2005,"I think the New York Times had it right--if you missed all of the romantic comedies of 2005, you can make up for it with this one movie. While the movie's premise had a mite of potential, it was wasted on a bland and predictable story. ""The Graduate"" is such a classic movie that this one cannot even hope to come close to it. It's too bad they didn't get any of the original cast to play their original parts--Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft could have returned in rather clever cameos (obviously they wanted no part in this movie). But we did get Shirley McClaine, who is really the only saving grace of this movie and rips the movie right out from underneath her co-stars' feet. She's right on target as usual--sharp as a tack! The others are competent in their roles, although Kevin Costner has cleverly reinvented himself as a middle-aged man who doesn't take himself quite as seriously anymore. Who would have seen that coming?",Rumor Has It...

113,AgNail,This is a biased review,8,30 May 2006,"Let me get this out in the open immediately so there is no confusion - I will pretty much give any movie that Jennifer Aniston appears in nothing less than an 8. I say this unabashedly and with the realization that, to the general public, some/most of her movies have been average at best. I can't help it. After watching ""Rumor Has It"", I turned to my wife and admitted that I don't know if Aniston is a good actress or not; I simply love watching her. Any, yes, I will also admit the ""Along Came Polly"" is one of my favorite movies of all time. Having said all this, and trying my best to appear objective, I found ""Rumor Has It"" to be an enjoyable movie. Reiner does a nice job of keeping a good pace, and the performances are capable, with exceptional being the word I would use for both Shirley MacLaine (as Aniston's Grandmother) and Kathy Bates (as Aniston's Aunt Mimi.) Perhaps it's not the best movie ever made, or even the best movie made in 2005, but as a rental, it's definitely worth the $2.50. Jennifer Aniston alone is worth at least $3.00.",Rumor Has It...

From the first bland voice-over from Aniston this movie goes nowhere. There are so many problems but the biggest by far is this: timing.There is none. Nothing happens and it happens so slowly that it was actually painful to watch this movie. None of the characters show any real redeemable qualities and even Shirley Mc, who is so often great, just manages to be despicable here.I really would like to recommend something good about this movie, but I just can't. I mean, really. Jennifer Aniston and Kevin Costner in the same movie equals so much wooden acting that they should start their own lumber company.2/10",Rumor Has It...

What is wrong with movies being fun and entertaining?? people are getting too serious about the films they see. I myself love both drama and comedy; so this one was perfect, because it was both combined.Jennifer Aniston was not miscast, because this is exactly the kind of movie Jennifer is famous for. I am always a little reluctant at first to see her films, because I think I am always going to see Rachel Greeene from ""Friends 1994-2004 on the screen. But I loved this one, it was new and fresh; a different kind of romantic comedy told differently.Jennifer also has been in many other ""Non Rachel"" movies such as ""The Good Girl ""Rockstar"" ""Derailed"", and ""The Object of my affection. In ""Rumor Has It she is wonderful, and has some very very funny moments, Shirley is fabulous.

116,muttsnutman,Clever and amusing,7,20 July 2006,"Missed this on release and rented on DVD last night, not expecting too much, and was pleasantly surprised.This is a movie based on an interesting idea using the 'What if...' formula. In this case ""What if The Graduate was actually based on real life, and it was MY family?"" This allows a whole raft of interesting ideas to be floated across the screen with the main question being ""Is the Graduate my father?"" Jennifer Aniston tracks down the guy who apparently slept with her mother and grandmother, leaving Mark Ruffalo hanging out to dry, and lo and behold, she gets drunk and sleeps with him!! With some nice scenery, a great ensemble cast and this interesting premise, the film was a refreshing delight. All the principal characters played their parts well. Mena Suvari makes an appearance but has a minimal role, Maclaine, Aniston, Ruffalo and even Costner perform well but the stars of the movie should be the scriptwriters. The film needs listening to as well as watching or else some of the best is lost. The dialogue is sharp and acid but still leaves you with a high feel-good factor at the end of the movie.Too many people seem to be criticising the film because it is not a remake of the Graduate - but it was clearly never meant to be - and it was an interesting take on changing times and changing lives.Is it deeply artistic and full of social commentary - no, is it a smart piece of entertainment giving value for money - most definitely!",Rumor Has It...

Some reviewers say that Shirley MacLaine partially saves this movie but don't believe it, she is totally wasted and her schtick falls flat here. Mark Ruffalo, who has been good in recent films is really bad in this disaster. The sister who gets married is one of the most stupid characters I've seen in a movie in a long time.

It may help to watch The Graduate (again) just before going to see this one, but it is not mandatory for a good experience.

Shirley McClaine should get Oscar consideration as supporting actress, even if her character is somewhat reminiscent of the one she played in ""Steel Magnolias."" This is the best performance I have seen from Jennifer Aniston, who may be becoming the successor to Meg Ryan as ""America's Sweetheart."" Despite the near-slapstick comedy, there are some genuinely touching conversations between Aniston and the other family members. And there's a wonderful twist at the end which I won't reveal here--it brings the plot together nicely.

120,marty-80,"If you liked ""The Graduate"", you may well dislike this movie",1,26 December 2005,"""The Graduate"" was a movie that tried to show how disillusionment with superficial middle- class life makes some people do stupid and immoral things, and how love nevertheless helps to regain one's soul. It was a taboo-breaking, funny, poetic film with an incredible soundtrack.In contrast, ""Rumor Has It"", in effect, merely demonstrates that Republican fogies living comfortable in Pasadena know the secret to life. The only people who question the great middle-class dream are neurotic, but not to worry: after sleeping around they find happiness in marriage, tradition, and work.The soundtrack of this stinker of a movie is mediocre. The sex is sleazy and embarrassing. Costner and McLaine do some first-class acting but Buffalo is bovine and Aniston, despite having exceptional comic talent, is an unconvincing Everywoman -- she looks like she works out four hours a day.To be avoided.",Rumor Has It...

The story is about a woman in her thirties who hears that her mother had 1 one week fling with some else and then married her father.

I decided to see ""Rumor Has It"" because at 8 or 9 years old I saw Shirly McClain in ""Apartment"" and got my first memorable woody dwelling on the shadow her legs disappeared up into. It probably led me to rub up against the pretty blond 5th grade teacher across the hall when she had recess duty. And in any case, it felt deliciously more uncontrollable than wrapping my blanket in thick folds and caressing my lips with it to thoughts of the tightly red wrapped dragon lady in ""Stopover Tokyo."" I saw that when I was 6 or 7.I didn't see ""Some Came Running"" until it hit TV's Saturday Night at the Movies (or something like that), but I was getting my cheap thrills from the sexy parts of James Bond books by then. I never forgave Dean Martin for calling Shirl a you-know-what, however. I won't repeat the slander, but with all that in mind I wanted another glimpse of Shirl's legs and got a bit more, a sliver of Jen's right boob, not withstanding its metaphorical place for the promises coming out of silicon valley for a life luxury and ease through software from the purely mythological man who coincidentally signs checks with green ink. Yes, BTT strikes every 10 billion dollars or so of P&E over-valuation, but only the strong survive along with the cowardly who buy cheap after the carnage of a crash, and on the upside another 10 billion is sure to come in the next wave and redeem everybody.""Rumor Has It"" should definitely not be considered absent ""The Graduate."" Where ""The Graduate"" spins an emerging baby boomer generation totally dazed and confused in America, ""Rumor Has It"" nails a finer slice of love's illusions where the devastation of over-spin in a game of ""pin the tale on the wonkey"" can be fixed with strength of character and backspin toward the basics of joy in day to day commitment to someone you can dig for just being there. Among us terminal lone wolves, cat tenders get it above all. Deep down it kills us to know if they had thumbs, credit and a perpetually warm, hot water bottle we would be superfluous and yearn for any other illusion of comfort as love.Jennifer Anniston plays great emotional slapstick. I don't watch sitcoms. I saw a couple ""Friends"" episodes, but wrote it off as potentially too enjoyable to survive another TV addiction after Star Trek NG and West Wing. After the thrill of revisiting her lower gams, I could not get Shirl standing in for a riper Anne Bancroft. Would someone please make an sequel of ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" called ""Oy, Oy Look What the Cats Dragged In"" with Shirl and Anne as opposing in-law mothers rolling on the floor pulling hair and kneeing each other in the kishkas. Okay, so maybe a remake of ""The Turning Point"" is what I am after.""Rumor Has It"" arguably starts with a sad premise for a movie, the real life people behind ""The Graduate,"" and the jokey references struggle to be funny, but JA's slapstick and a variety of quasi one liners which inch along sustain interest long enough, for the really moving one-liners to hit like the Sunday morning paper bouncing off the screen door. They're loaded and finally delivered. Not finally, as in 'it's about time' so much, but finally as in 'nice reveal,' more so.There are interesting transitions relative to family dynamic which rival some of the family bonding reveals in ""The Family Stone."" Fundamentally different movies, we do not see so much the exposure of an underlying family dynamic in ""The Family Stone,"" as we see that dynamic in action. Nor do we see it in ""Rumor Has It"" so much as we see a new family dynamic emerging with profound effects on the growth of family relationships. That's a nice accomplishment.On a 1 to 10 relative scale, hmmm, how about a 7 and a kudo for relevant and socially redeeming entertainment for the way the JA's character navigates her relationships. It plays like the beginning, middle and end of a twisted 'lived happily' after fairy tale with not so much transition (though there's a real good one as profound as any in the emerging family dynamic) as self exploration and realization.",Rumor Has It...

I especially liked Ruffalo's role as the guy who gets left out by his fiancé played by Aniston. He gives the movie its hanging edge. Costner plays well also with a part which set on a smart man who did well in business and like that of Maclaine, gives the story a historical link to this movie's inspiration - The Graduate.

Well, don't expect much....and you will have fun!!! You do not have to take this movie seriously, it is just a lighthearted movie (comedy/drama) with a few good laughs(e.g. grandma Katherine's toast to the newlyweds, the family phone call with Sarah, grandma, sister, father involved)""Rumor Has It"" is not the movie of the year....Or it is not a great movie, but it is definitely watchable, and it is really fun at times. I agree that that the storyline is so predictable, but most of the movies in Hollywood are predictable one way or the other, so what is the big deal? I do not think Jennifer Aniston is a very good actress, yet she is okay in this movie; Kevin Costner and Shirley McLaine are really good---I think Kevin Costner is making a good comeback, he was even better in the Upside of Anger earlier this year--- and their confrontation in front of the house is fun!",Rumor Has It...

Kevin Costner portrayal of (supposedly) the Benjamin Braddock character was laughable. I kept thinking that the writer of this movie had never seen the original Graduate. Ben was NOT a smooth Casanova-type guy. He was not the smooth winner-type that Costner portrayed. The Katherine Ross character in the original did NOT leave her fiancée at the alter to run off with Benjamin for a week or so. The fiancée was a pompous jerk - we all hoped she would leave him and go off with Benjamin. Anyone who has any idea of the characters in the original knows that the father portrayed in Rumor Has It was as far removed from the fiancée in the original as Kevin Coaster was with his portrayal of Benjamin. Mark Ruffalo has been in a few good movies of late and was totally wasted in this one. I wonder why Shirley MacLain would associate herself with this movie. I should mention here that the person I watched the movie had very little memory of the Graduate. She just agreed with my '2' rating on face value.

One can only guess at some point the producers had the blessings of Lawrence Turman and Mike Nichols, and that those fine fellows pulled out of any involvement after reading this trite, thoughtless script, which does the equivalent of film name dropping in lieu of taking an original approach. Obviously, some very talented people got on board the project (executive producers Steven Soderbergh, George Clooney, actors Kevin Costner, Jennifer Aniston, Shirley MacLaine, Mark Ruffalo) but even that collected talent can't save what begins as a decent premise but devolves into implausible and rote execution. All the actors could play these roles in their sleep, although MacLaine deserves extra credit for a scene-chewing performance to make Pac-Man proud. And what, pray tell, is so sympathetic about beautiful rich people whose lives aren't perfect. Is anybody dying? Does the main character want anything? No, not really. She's happy, she's just not perfectly happy. Aniston's fine here, it's just she has nothing to work with. Almost as much thought went in to this as a fill-in-the- blanks screen writing exercise. What does the main character do? Uh, Obits writer for The Times. What about the reflection character? It's her , uh, sister. Yeah, and she's getting married.

I'd rather they re-release truly original, inspired films like the ones they mar than throw them in a blender and see what hodge-podge comes out.Jennifer Aniston deserves a nod for flailing discreetly in the wimpy script and for acting like she even wanted to stand near Kevin Cosner, who has all the sexual magnetism of a dry flounder.The movie-- if it does anything-- does one thing, it proves Shirley McClain's got it and she can fake it even when given a bad script. I give it a 3 because I laughed at least twice, Shirley McClain gets a point for sauciness, and the final point for the studio that had the audacity to have a love connection between a girl and someone who not 5 minutes before she thought was her father--wowzer.Skip it. Rent the graduate. Rent Casablanca. Make Hollywood give us better films.",Rumor Has It...
136,mthomatz,One of the Worst,1,3 April 2007,"""Rumor Has It"" is a movie that should not have been made. It was playing on HBO during my stay at a hotel and I made the mistake of getting sucked into it, mostly because I hoped Jennifer Aniston would prove me wrong and actually make a good movie. She's a one-note actress with good comedic timing (stop Jen stop!). The more I see of her the less I like her. This movie is a Romantic Comedy that wants to be original but instead falls into every possible cliché (I'd like to see a ""romantic comedy"" where the woman ends up alone because she realizes the men around her are complete buffoons). I won't even go into the story line - suffice it to say that you can easily predict the ending (and pretty much everything else that happens). Truthfully, this film is no more than a mish-mash of re-used jokes and contrived situations. Ughhh...the more I thought about it the more angry it made me. Rumor has it you don't want to waste your precious time watching this piece of junk.",Rumor Has It...

So when I came on this bored I was very surprised a lot of people hated this movie.I can see the sides to the people who hate this, I really can, but some how you shouldn't take a movie too seriously. It was fun to watch. I agree it wasn't that funny, not funny at all, but I still loved it.Yeah, I thought it was pretty disturbing about how she kissed her ""dad"", but you can see they were obviously drunk, and when Sarah woke up she couldn't believe what had happened. I disagree they didn't have any chemistry. I could see that they did.I thought it was very warming how after all of this, Sarah is closer to her family. At the start she wants a relationship with adventure. So she gets that. But she realises she wouldn't want to settle down with someone just about adventure - just like her mum. After, she realises she wants to settle down with Jeff.We, or I, can see clearly that she is now close with her family. After all that, she finally learnt about her mum, and can see clear.I do agree of how Jeff could take her back. I think he loved her unconditionally. Even in these situations, even if your partner does something bad, sometimes you still love them and want to take them back. Jeff realised she was truly sorry, and thus running after her. I believe in almost every relationship there is always going to be a down-fall.Like I said, I do agree why people hate this, but I didn't expect much and just enjoyed it for what it was. It was just a bit of fun, and if the whole plot was realistic, well, it would be boring. And thanks to Shirley it made this movie kick ass!",Rumor Has It...

139,kuni55,Beg to Differ,6,17 June 2006,"I beg to differ with javaroast. I found the movie to be very entertaining. I contains all the elements of plot (family is real life version of the Graduate with flashbacks), sub-plot (relationships between Anniston and her grandmother, boy friend, father, sister, and Costner), and twisted plots (sleeping with her ""father,"" parallel paths with her mother, and finding out her father kicked Costner in the nuts in the soccer game 30 years ago). The tension between MacLaine and Costner, MacLaine and her son-in-law, and MacLain and everybody except the two granddaughters keeps the movie on pace. The repetitious image of the smoking cigarette getting the ashes flicked off maintains the connection to ""The Graduate."" However, I didn't judge the movie on its technical merits.

The big problem with this is that Titanic was not released until December of 1997. Giving the timeline the benefit of the doubt that this story took place in December of '97, they show a poster of the date Kevin Costner is giving his 'internet' speech...and the date is clearly marked as February 17, 1997.

142,gclites,A great idea poorly developed. Wait for the video.,5,3 January 2006,"The idea of a film based on the long extant rumor that The Graduate was conceived around true events in the life of a real family was a great one. So much the worse that Rumor Has It does such a poor job developing the concept.Sarah Huttinger is a young engaged journalist completely dissatisfied with her life and filled with trepidations about marrying Jeff (Mark Ruffalo). She travels home for her sister's (Mena Suvari) wedding and is further depressed to find herself a complete outsider in her own family (hints of Dustin Hoffman completely intended). Her grandmother (Shirley MacLaine) lets slip a hint which leads her to discover that her family is the famed basis of the book, then the film, The Graduate. Further, that her mother may have slept with the man upon whom Benjamin Braddock was based (here called Beau Burroughs and played by Kevin Costner) at just around the time she got pregnant with Sarah. Suddenly, Sarah's lost-in-the-family feelings make sense, and she goes in search of Beau and possibly her unusual heritage.As I said, it's a great idea. Unfortunately, the outcome is a ham-handed mess, entertaining and funny at some points, dull and rambling at others. The primary story, involving Sarah, her family and fiancé is reasonably interesting. Aniston does okay; Ruffalo gives a solid performance; and MacLaine steals the entire movie in her maybe 12 minutes of screen time. The problem is really in the sections of the film featuring Beau Burroughs. They contribute almost nothing to the through line of the movie, develop no relevant themes, and stop the story dead for long periods of time. My guess is that the character was conceived as a minor, though key player in the plot, but was padded and padded when star Costner signed on. I like Costner, but this creates a big bloated balloon of pointless plot stalling at the center of the film and it brings the film to a dead stop. The Graduate is a beautiful film, developing its themes gently, ironically and with great style. Rumor Has It tries at moments to mirror the style of the original, but those scenes only serve to point out the weakness of the new version and its in-your-face lack of thematic style.Not that it's a terrible film. The idea is clever enough to make it worth a rental on video, if only to consider how Reiner and company blew such a great opportunity. There are several good performances, notably MacLaine's, who may rate a supporting actress nomination for her effort. And the gentle climax set in a quiet kitchen is actually quite moving, mirroring Reiner's earlier work and pointing out what might have been had he developed the film from the beginning with no pressure from stars and the many co-producers listed in the opening credits. As it is, all we're left with is a weak film based on a really great idea.",Rumor Has It...
143,kegstand_liaison,The worst chick flick I have ever seen!,1,26 July 2006,"Not only is the plot bad, it was just gross, and stupid. I have never been so disappointed in my life. I rented the movie because I LIKE Jennifer Aniston AND Kevin Costner, but the two of them together, has been proved to be an unsuccessful thing. Kevin did a better job in ""WaterWorld"", and Jennifer did a better job in ""Leprechaun"". Now THAT's pretty sad. I would not even allow this movie to be rented out to anyone else if I could. I would recommend ""Battlefield Earth"" over this movie. I could talk about this all night, about how obscene the plot was and how it all turned out. Why in the hell did her fiancé marry her in the end? That just makes him look like a puss. Why didn't she answer her phone when he called? Was she TRYING to get caught, or did she really not care?

However I was pleasantly surprised. Jennifer Aniston maybe isn't her best but neither is the plot line. She worked the best with what she had. Shirley MacLaine, however was excellent in her role and probably gave the best laughs in the whole movie. It may have been an overacted performance but it brought life to the film which it wouldn't have got if Shirley MacLaine wasn't in it. It wasn't exactly the most dramatic and spectacular of all movies but it wasn't meant to be. It was a fun and entertaining light movie, great to see with mates.

146,mhedrick-3,lackluster - other possible Graduate sequel was possible,3,11 November 2006,"Yea, the movie is really, really lackluster but watchable.I wanted to mention another possible sequel to ""The Graduate"" that Dustin Hoffman has mentioned that Buck Henry came up with. The idea was also included in ""The Player"" when Buck Henry did a cameo in that movie. Anyway, the idea was that all the principals from ""The Graduate"" were still all alive and could do a sequel where the Hoffman and Ross characters are married, and the Bancroft character is old and has moved in with them. The plot would be that the Hoffman character is now messing around with the babysitter. In other words, he has become Mrs. Robinson. Now that is a good idea for a sequel, not this.As far as ""Rumor Has It"" goes, it would have been infinitely better off if it hadn't even brought up ""The Graduate"" in terms of its plotting. All it does is constantly remind you that you aren't currently watching a good movie like ""The Graduate"".One other comment about ages. Aniston is almost 40 and looks it. Costner is 51 but looks much older. Would it hurt for the casting to be better???",Rumor Has It...

My life certainly isn't better. The entire plot of the movie is just plain idiot. Is this suppose to be a sequel to the graduate, or are producers really just running out of ideas. Heres a concept, lets actually make a movie with an original idea, and cast actors who aren't used to receiving inflated paychecks who will portray characters with some depth and real insight into the dynamic changes and hardships you go through in love and marriage. I recommend the last kiss. Jennifer Aniston has been the same character in her last 5 films. Flighty, confused about love life and how long her hair should be. Kevin Coaster has the appeal of a bar of soap, and not in the sense you would feel clean and refreshed. In the sense that the mans acting isn't even noticed or given a second thought unless you really are some sort of closet costner fan. Don't waste your time. its not even worth seeing it to laugh at how bad it is. use the 90 minutes to go for a run",Rumor Has It...

Also I thought that Shirley MacLaine should have given Beau some ""blunt testicular trauma"" for what he did. She was fantastic in this movie! Jeff should have been played by someone other than Ruffalo. He was so monotone. Jeff should have more backbone or something. there should have also been more of a mystery leading to the discovery of the ""graduate"".",Rumor Has It...

Sarah was upset because No. 1, she thought Beau was her father and that would have explained why she was different. Then, No. 2, when she found out he wasn't her father her explanation wasn't valid and she was right back where she started. Beau was sterile, he explained that fact when his ""son"" showed up at the party. Sarah's fiancé found Beau and Sarah because he called Beau's office and asked how to find him.

152,kwackers,"Good premise, bad execution.",5,14 January 2006,"I went to see this movie with my girlfriend. I didn't have high expectations of it, but on the other hand some ""chick"" movies have surprised me so I tried to have an open mind.The movie opens with the familiar premise: the female lead, Sarah, is having second thoughts about marrying her boyfriend Jeff, who is nice but not really exciting (he's a lawyer). The pair are on their way from New York to the Sarah's sister's wedding in Pasadena. It is at this wedding that the premise for the movie is introduced, that the movie and book ""The Graduate"" are based on Sarah's mother and grandmother. Obviously Sarah is a little upset about this, even more so when she realises that this could mean that her father is not who she thinks it is. Following the wedding (in which Sarah ignores her only sister's nuptials to glower at her grandmother) Sarah decides to track down the man, a Beau Brady.Sarah locates Beau in San Francisco. Beau is and is quick to reassure her that he can't be her father due to ""Sudden Testicular Trauma"" he suffered as a child. What follows is a forced romance between Beau and Sarah. There is zero chemistry between the two actors, and the ""romance"" is pushed on us too fast for it to be believable. It was even slightly disturbing to watch, as Sarah switches from believing Beau to be her father to sleeping with him in a few hours. What follows is fairly predictable. Sarah becomes even more uncertain and completely ignores her fiancé. Jeff eventually comes looking for her, to be revealed by a slow camera pan as Sarah and Beau kiss. At this stage it looks like Sarah and Jeff's relationship is pretty much finished.Sarah heads back to her family home in Pasadena. It is here that her father reveals knew that Sarah's mother slept with Beau, but he forgave her because he loved her. Buoyed by this information Sarah heads back to New York to confront Jeff. After offering a weak apology she leaves. Of course this is a romantic film so Jeff chases after her to offer his forgiveness, and everyone lives happily ever after, as indicated by the closing montage of their wedding.The premise of this film had a lot of potential, but I don't think the filmmakers knew what to do with it. The character of Sarah spends much of the movie wandering around, either looking lost or being self obsessed in a ""woe is me, I have not yet found my life's meaning"" kind of way. Many parts of the film felt forced, the romance between Sarah and Beau, but most noticeably the conclusion. Having Jeff chase after the woman who cheated on him felt like it was added only to give the film the classic romantic ending.The acting was not bad, but most performances were quite dull. Jennifer Aniston (Sarah) failed to create any empathy for her character. Mark Ruffalo (Jeff) and Kevin Costner (Beau) delivered passable performances. The best character was the grandmother, played by Shirley MacLaine. She saved much of this film from being dull, and provided most of the comedy that was otherwise missing from this ""Romantic Comedy""",Rumor Has It...

Unfortunately, there was also a terrible script, bad pacing, poor editing and, except for Shirley MacLaine, not very good acting and very few laughs. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. A complete waste of my time and money. I know this observation has been made elsewhere. but Rob Reiner should make a choice between full time movie making and full time political activism, because he clearly cannot do both at the same time. The problems with the movie became apparent in the first few moments during the airplane sequence. There was no chemistry between Jennifer Aniston and Mark Rufalo, and while that may have worked to emphasize the point that she was reluctant to get married, it also meant that the viewer had no rooting interest in seeing them get together in the end, although true to romantic comedy form, that ending was bound to happen. Frankly, the dull, humorless beginning was the real foreshadowing of the entire movie, which was also humorless and dull. The film only picked up its pace on the few occasions when MacLaine was on screen. She could have been giving a masters class in acting to her fellow cast members, but obviously they weren't paying attention, The real bottom line is that while there was a kernel of a good idea in this update of The Graduate, the script was unfunny and the characters were unsympathetic.",Rumor Has It...

160,orittele,Decent writing is not enough when the directing and acting are bad.,5,24 September 2006,"I read some comments saying that the script was bad, but I'll have to disagree there. This film was, from my point of view, a proof that bad directing and acting can kill any decent script. Not to say that the script was flawless - there have been some scenes that even on paper were dumb (especially the scene of Aniston&Ruffalo at The Casblanca Ball, and the scene of Aniston&Shirley MacLaine at MacLaine's house with the screaming over the phones - no actors could save such ridiculous scenes) and I'd say that in the last 30 minutes, from the Aniston&Ruffalo scene at The Casablanca Ball, the writing went a little bit downhill too. But for the most part, the premise was good, the film is not exactly a typical ""a boy meets a girl and they fall in love and live happily ever after"" romance film, there's a bunch of events and good pace, and there are some good lines. BUT, and ""but"" is the keyword here -- the directing was so bad, that even the stronger actors of the cast failed to deliver. The performances are so charisma-free, that you simply don't get to care about the characters or about what happens next. In a romantic movie, the characters are supposed to have good chemistry in order to draw the viewers into the story, but Jennifer Aniston has zero chemistry with both Kevin Costner and Mark Ruffalo. There's such wooden acting all around, that the actors couldn't act to save their own lives. When I finished the movie, I just said ""Thank God it's finally over"". With another cast, another director, and more emphasis on the feelings of ""I don't belong here"" of Jennifer Aniston's character, this would have been a decent movie.

The movie was flippant and superficial, completely a waste of my time. I tried and tried, but I could not come up with a single aspect of this movie I didn't hate. The entire cast was obnoxious, maybe excepting Mark Ruffalo, but only because I think he's cute. It was, overall, dirty, offensive, and downright pointless. It's completely illogical to even conceive that a man would sleep with three different generations of the same family. And really, I don't believe that Ruffalo's character would give in so easily. All she has to do is tear up and twist his words a little and he forgives her? Shameful.",Rumor Has It...

The few and unhappy laughs gleaned from this film could not wash away the taste of putrefaction.All the original wit, sharpness and beauty of 'graduate' was obtusely washed down the drain, and replaced with a dull cannibalized banal plot.Conclusion ? let any Reiner directed piece of thievery rest undisturbed.Thanks for sh**ing on my plate, Rob.",Rumor Has It...
169,ollioxinfree,Fun idea; some witty dialog; little chemistry.,3,9 July 2006,"You know how before films are released, they are usually passed by test audiences? A better use of everyone's time would be to show test audiences short scenes with the cast you have *in mind* - thus finding out BEFORE you spend millions on the production, if the chemistry that the director and casting director *think* is there, is actually there.Sadly, there are scant sparks between Aniston and Ruffalo's characters and no chemistry between Aniston and Costner's characters. This pushed the movie, already comically-challenged, into often boring territory.The film is a bit of a mess, but I wanted to see how it would end, and I was enjoying every scene that Shirley MacLaine was in. She was given the best dialog by far and she was great at giving it back. Ruffalo, Aniston and Costner had far less to work with, but they seemed to be making what they could with what they had. Generally, there was a missed opportunity for what could have been a very funny movie.",Rumor Has It...
170,chopinx,Whores and retards,1,12 June 2006,"This movie is all about whores and retards! Any woman who has sex with another man 1 week before she is to be married, is a whore. Any man who agrees to marry her, even after he has learned of this, is a retard. When a whore and a retard breed, the result is predictable: more whores and retards! Case in point, Jennifer Aniston character (I won't bother with character names, as I'm doing my best to forget this movie).Here is a woman who had sex with a man whom she believed could very likely be her father just a few hours before. This is romance? There where times in this movie that I wanted very much to throw the remote at the TV, throw-up all over myself, then take a shower to cleanse myself. But a shower wasn't going to do the trick, because I couldn't very well get the bar of soap to my brain to wash the images of this movie out of my memory. So here I am, stuck with these horrid images! On top of the story itself being sickening, the casting for this movie was totally inadequate. For one, Aniston indeed does not look like anyone else in her family, just as she herself points out in the film. But this sorry fact is never explained. In fact, not a single pair of cast members had any chemistry at all. I don't understand how on earth this movie could ever pass as a romance, or a comedy.It's clear that Aniston will do any picture, at this point, to elevate her film career. And Costner will do any picture that allows him to make out with younger women.A better ending for this sorry picture would have been if Aniston had found out that she had in fact slept with her own biological father. At least with that, it would explain to the audience why she looked nothing like the rest of her family, and send a message to all watching this movie: don't be a whore; you could end up sleeping with your own father and not even know it.Too bad a DNA analysis was absent from the end credits...",Rumor Has It...

This came on my Netflix and really surprised me by its quality. Well acted rom coms are hard to find and I think Jennifer Anniston gives a seriously good performance, (it really shows what a good actress she is). Despite the storyline sounding unbelievable it is acted so well you go with it, and it is refreshingly honest about fear that can creep into relationships - and how they aren't all Hollywood black and perfect white. It explores feeling lost and 'different' in an original way and how love stories don't always have a straight path. If you can look past the premise and follow Jennifer's journey it is an entertaining watch, full of surprises. It's not super funny but doesn't need to be to be enjoyed.",Rumor Has It...

It is impossible to identify with any of the characters. With the exception of ""Jeff,"" (Mark Ruffalo) all of the characters are self-involved, pitiful people.

The script has so many clichés it could have been written by computer (Commodore Pet).This parasite on one of the best movies ever made was disjointed and totally unbelievable. It felt like the film was hacked together in between other the making of other films. As though the actors has to be reminded about the purpose of the film at the start of each scene.Only redeeming features were Shirley McLaine trying to act like Anne Bancroft, and James Taylor as Jennifer Anniston's father (ok it wasn't James T but a good lookalike).

With this many A-Listers attached, the original script must have been good -- what happened? I don't know, maybe the original script was not that great -- I certainly can't tell who is responsible for the lack of humor or quirkiness in this script. I missed a few parts of the film, so I don't understand why the film took place in the early 90's (or late 80's? -- I don't know) -- a strange choice, it seems to me. Many problems with this one, but a few good points -- Shirley MacLaine, Richard Jenkins, Kathy Bates, Mark Ruffalo did okay despite being somewhat miscast, and even Mena Suivari gave it an enthusiastic try for a silly role. A huge problem for me was the role of Sarah, and the actress who played that role, Jennifer Aniston. It is difficult to tell if the role was written to be so boring, or that Jennifer Aniston is such a boring actress who insists on trying to look ""just so"" -- the end result is a leading lady turn that has absolutely no charm, no originality, no humor, no wit, and no connection. I did not warm to her character at all. Totally bland character. Her life is a movie chiche, and her fears about getting married are baseless. She wonders if her father is even related to her, because he drives so slowly and she drives fast... huh? She looks down her nose at the Pasadena inhabitants, even though she is so totally self-obsessed and boring, with her high-maintenance hair and perfect clothes, she is a complete Southern California bland rich kid. Kevin Costner plays Beau in a semi-sombulant state, but he does perk up when he is given the opportunity to interact with Shirley -- that was interesting. No chemistry between Costner and Aniston. Everyone seems to be trying to look attractive and meaningful -- the result is a shallow tedious exercise in spending money. Clothes, locations, and the weather is nice. I would love to read the original script -- I'm sure the writer wishes he could publish it so he can hold up his head proudly. The premise had potential! I'm glad I saw this in TV, as it would have been unbearable to watch Jennifer Aniston's face scrunching and lip biting mode of acting on the big screen. She is better suited for TV. She can't sustain interest for 2 hours.",Rumor Has It...
179,droidrun,Great sequel to the the graduate.,9,25 October 2021,Jennifer Aniston gives great performance as well as the rest of the crew.It has it all in a romantic comedy. It's slightly more risque than the G movie rom coms.These movies are for adults aren't they? There weren't any cartoon fish.Indeed there is a clear nod to China Town literally and metaphorically. So much so I have to question the ending. The writers/directors clearly injected the notion for the viewer to ponder.Mena Suvari does a great job portraying the giddy little sister.Mrs Robinson excellently portrayed. She's exactly as one might imagine. An assertive fireball though her jilted slant didn't fit her character. I expected her to have a no remorse attitude like Beau.The ending was lazy.

A good plot although not very realistic(mother, daughter, granddaughter - all by the same man). It would've been great to have Dustin Hoffman to play the Beau B. role, as planned early in the film's pre-production stages, but Kevin Costner managed honorably. Although it doesn't say much, I enjoyed Beau Burroughs character. On the other hand I just simply don't like Mena Suvari, I don't know why, I simply don't. Shirley MacLaine is fabulous.

It seems as though Reiner's wheels gave out at the last scene, where Mark Ruffalo takes back Jennifer Aniston, regardless of all of the events that occurred. It is a movie without a point, a movie without reason. It is simply a messy storyline with no interesting parts. It's a shame that a respected director would make such a boring film. I understand it probably isn't supposed to be a feel-good movie, but nevertheless, it seems as though Reiner attempts to do that at the end, failing miserably.

There is an unexpected depth to the material which elevates it from your average romantic drama. It came a no surprise that Rob Reiner was at the helm. It has the same sort of playful, heartfelt humor present in many of his previous films. The script is full of fun plot twists. It looks at issues from multiple perspectives and that gives the film complexity and interest. The cast is extremely likeable. The female characters are particularly modern, active, intelligent and sexually liberated. It's no surprise to me that the screenwriter, Ted Griffin, hails from Pasadena because there is a real specificity to his writing. I often agree with the critics, but in this case, I was absolutely shocked by their response. All I can think is that maybe it was improperly marketed or just unlucky timing with its release in 2005.

Jennifer Aniston is a delight...she can do both comedy and drama so well. Mark Ruffalo is ever woman's dream come true. Kevin Costner's acting was convincing. Shirley MacLaine is one of my favourite actresses because she brings so much class (in such an odd way) and fun to all of her movies.

This film is beginning to show Jennifer's maturity as an actress on the big screen. The film started a little slow at first, but then progressed nicely. Jennifer's screen presence was very captivating. Kevin Costner was an excellent addition midway through the film. There were some emotional moments that could create a few tears. This definitely will become a woman's must-see film as more and more people see it. Men will enjoy it too, maybe not so much for the emotional side of the film, but Jennifer's beauty will keep the attention of most men for the duration of the film.

She seems to have a nice chemistry with all of her leading men. I also thought the choice of songs by Mr. Reiner was very good and added to the humor of the situation. If you enjoyed ""The Graduate"" you will enjoy this film. There's also some beautiful shots of norther California that add to the charm.

192,burlinga,Formulaic and profoundly disappointing,4,22 December 2005,"A lot of the promotion for ""Rumor Has It"" has centered around the first fifteen minutes or so of the film--that is, the point where Jennifer Aniston's character gets an inkling whether her family is the basis for the Robinsons in ""The Graduate,"" and then how she pursues this possibility with her grandmother, the man who would be Ben Braddock and others. This is a good promotion strategy, because ultimately when you take away the ""Graduate"" references, there's not much of value in ""Rumor Has It."" THe film is uninspired and bears a remarkable resemblance to just about every other romantic comedy out there.THe film starts and she's bored with her life--she used her journalism degree to get a job writing the obituaries and marriage announcements at the New York Times; she's got a fiancé who it's unclear from the first moment of the movie whether she wants to actually marry. So she decides that the curiosity she has about her past is important enough to jeopardize everything, and that's where the conflict of the story comes in. Without spoilers it's difficult to properly explain what occurs in this film, except to say that you can see where she's going every step of the way.",Rumor Has It...

It would have been better had Aniston kept trying to find clues about their past. And they should have at least had some references to the original. There was a big party scene where it would have been funny to overhear someone talking about ""plastics."" They could have also gone to Berkeley and maybe pass Moe's Bookshop or the zoo.I heard the real Mrs. Robinson was actually based on Charles Webb's mother-in-law.

I think it's a matinée type movie, definitely not worth 12 bucks prime time. But then again, you can always wait til it comes out on DVD too. It's just one of those movies that can wait til DVD unless you're a die hard Jennifer Aniston fan. If you love Meg Ryan romantic comedy movies, then you'd be disappointed in this movie. There's no comparison with the two. Meg can be the star of the movie because she's got that personality that captivates a big audience.

Kevin Costner is well, Kevin Costner. He is still one of the best. The movie is entertaining and fun, not something to analyze or over think.

I haven't seen that in a movie in a LONG time and certainly not a slick flick with top actors and what is suppose to be a top director. It became so frequent that it was distracting and I started counting out loud. Got a few laughs, but it was a bit sad. Cosner was smooth and came across as realistic as anyone could in a light comedy can.

Yes, I presume that many will call this a ""chick flick"", but this reviewer is a ""family guy"" who saw it with his wife, 15 year old, and 11 year old. Having seen it I'd recommend not bringing preteens, but they have been exposed to most of the innuendos from other media. Most of the actors work well together; Kevin Costner, Shirley MacLaine, and Jennifer Anniston fulfill their roles nicely.If you like romantic comedies that engage the ""who am I"" and ""what do I want out of life"" questions (read: ""The Family Guy""), then you will enjoy this one.",Rumor Has It...
207,b_warbs,A tasty treat!,8,28 December 2005,"I absolutely loved this movie. I thought it was charming, cute, and funny! And if you didn't at least giggle once, you must not have any sense of humor, or are just a very cynical person. This one of my probably one of my favorite Jennifer Aniston films, Kevin Costner shows that it doesn't matter how old he gets, he's still got it, and Shirley MacLaine was a hoot just like she usually is. There are so many memorable quotes from this movie, and the things that happen throughout it are just a riot. I thought Aniston was hilarious and really showed her talent in this film!It's a terrific first date movie, or a girls night out movie! I think even guys will enjoy this one!",Rumor Has It...
208,harpo1680,One of the worst movies ever!,1,30 December 2005,"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen! Initially, the idea of the movie being inspired by a classic like 'The Graduate' seemed quite clever and the trailer was intriguing but it was all very misleading. Despite the star-studded cast, this movie was positively awful in its execution! What could have been a very clever, funny plot was extremely ludicrous and not funny at all! Jennifer Aniston looks ugly, Kevin Costner is mediocre in this movie (for an actor of his caliber), and the only saving grace of the movie could have been Shirley Mclaine but she too has overacted and played an exaggerated version of the character that she could have been. All in all, I would suggest that you do not watch this movie as you will feel incredible remorse if you do! I am just glad that I saw the matinée show for this and the ticket was half-price.",Rumor Has It...
209,dmayracal,One of those movies that promote better than they play!,3,31 December 2005,"RUMOR HAS IT, with Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Costner, Shirley MacLaine, Mark Ruffalo, Richard Jenkins, Mena Suvari and Christopher McDonald.Excited by the previews and the overall premise of the film, I found the entire movie ""lacking"". The opportunities to make the film funnier seemed to amount to a series of set ups without the pay offs.A 3 out of 10 is due to Maclaine's performance as a sarcastic older lady that wants for her younger days. 90% of the funnier instances (of the few overall) can be attributed to her.In defense of Anniston and Costner, the script is to blame for the ""let-down"" moments of the film. Both are exceptional actors that seemed to hint at the chemistry needed to make the movie exceptional, but the script failed to provide.Rob Reiner has done so much better work in the past. I can only assume his heart wasn't in the making of this film and merely saw this as an opportunity for a paycheck.My overall opinion is this movie may serve as a reasonable rental on a cold winter's night during the TV re-run season. Otherwise, rent and watch the Graduate.",Rumor Has It...
210,lutkusb,Blue dress,7,3 January 2006,"I thought the movie was very cute! I also heard several bad reviews, but went to see it anyways. I loved the character that Shirley MacLain played. It suited her perfectly. I think this movie may have had too high of expectations because of all the publicity that Jennifer Aniston has been getting. I think this movie was meant to be cute and that is exactly what it was. Jennifer Aniston is always a pleasure to watch on screen. I also expect nothing less than great lines and laughs from Shirley Maclain. I was a little disappointed in the story line for Mina Suvari. I want that blue dress that Jennifer Aniston wore. Does anyone know who makes it or where to find it???",Rumor Has It...
211,westielvr265,Amazing!,10,3 January 2006,"So cute! I loved it! Everything was funny! If you like romantic comedies, you'll love this! Jennifer Aniston is an amazing actress. Shirley Maclaine and Mark Ruffalo were hilarious. I did not really care for Kevin Costner's acting but his chemistry was great with Shirley Maclaine. I did not stop laughing throughout the entire movie. My dad is a huge fan of The Graduate and he saw this movie twice because he thought it was so good! I love the references to The Graduate throughout the movie. The testicular trauma joke was funny. Even though the scene where Jennifer Aniston's character sleeps with Kevin Costner's character was creepy, it didn't really take away from the movie. You should definitely see it!",Rumor Has It...
212,leeann_stone,Sweet movie,6,5 January 2006,"This is more of a chick flick. The kind of movie you want to watch when you are feeling lazy and have nothing better to do. Jennifer Aniston did a great job but her grandmother Shirly MacLaine took the Emmy.Kevin Costner's participation in this movie was unusual. Made the movie very interesting. Overall, this movie needed a bit more gusto. It tends to drag and drag, and finally something happens. I think having Jennifer Aniston as one of the main characters didn't quite fulfill the part. The movie lacked pizzas and more drama.Perhaps, they should have considered Angelina Jolie. Not!!!!!!",Rumor Has It...
213,Strawberry66,I Loved It!!!,8,7 January 2006,"I didn't read these comments until after I went to see the movie. I have come to the conclusion that you either Loved it or Hated it. Personally I found myself laughing throughout the whole movie, with the exception of a couple teary eyed moments. Shirley McLain did and outstanding job in this movie, quirky, snide, and sarcastic. She had me laughing so much I had to stop the popcorn for fear of choking. The characters in this movie were great, Jennifer Annistion, from being neurotic to vaunerable, her sister from being a total ditz to a basically scared young lady, Kevin Costner with that same romantic sweep you off your feet yet tough guy way, and McLain who just point blank put them all in their place without caring if they liked it or not.So, I loved the movie, I loved the cast, I loved the characters. I will buy the DVD when it is released as well. My advice read the movie description, and the comments if you like, but definitely judge this one for yourself. If you like to laugh, you'll like this movie, and believe me when I tell you I was not laughing alone in the theater, It appeared and sounded to be enjoyed by most of the people there. Even heard one gal telling someone that the people in front of her were irritated and snapped at her for laughing so much. Go see the move and Enjoy!!",Rumor Has It...
214,marleentc,Editing,1,8 January 2006,"Whoever did the editing in this movie should be fired, I only saw the black mic a dozen times, I stop counting after 5. How hard is it to erase a mic from the ceiling of the shot. Oh and the cheezy lines made me realize that this movie sucked. The only thing funny about this movie was cracking jokes on it, Like when the girl said to the guy I don't blame you if you close the door on me, I said real loud in the theater Closed the Door, and everyone laughed. Only saw it cause my friends were dying to see it, I think we all died laughing from how horrible this movie really was. Its not worth the 10.00 bucks you pay at the movies.",Rumor Has It...
215,surpriseguy,Very weak flick. Too bad...,3,2 August 2007,"First of all I want to premise this comment with the fact that I love Jennifer Aniston. I really keep hoping for a Friends special or movie... That said, this particular vehicle is one of the weakest movies I have seen in a long time. There is NO chemistry between Costner and any of the other characters. On top of it when he is first introduced he is giving a speech about the Internet where he praises Che Guevara. I'm not sure what it was supposed to accomplish and it turned off half the people watching the movie with me... Several eventually just left the room... Pretty sad when the flick loses out to an old video game... Shirley MacLaine gives a good performance as she almost always does. The plot is totally predictable and the ending is lame. Too bad they didn't have an alternate ending where Costner tells Aniston she passed out and they didn't sleep together... Finally why Mark takes her back is beyond me. I just was totally disappointed in this flick. Good thing I bought it used for $3.99.",Rumor Has It...
216,sharanonline,does a premise of a story make a movie?,1,12 January 2006,"Jen and Kevin, promos replete with witty repartees promised a fresh ,funny and bubbly movie but it turned out like a day old champagne- flat and with wasted promise! Jen needs to grow out of her"" I am so cute and I can play that anytime, anywhere look"". it was fine for a while and being an unabashed Friends' fan, it was really good except when it's all her minus the gang. It jars.What can I say about Kevin Costener....looks old, acts old and watching him and Ms. Aniston have a go at it again reminds me of the day old bubbly...there was no point in saving it saving grace: Ms. Mcclaine. Who doesn't love a sassy old grandma on the whole: avoid. I saw this movie on a date and this being her choice, it does give me an upper hand when we decide on the next movie.",Rumor Has It...
217,eblaikie,"Not intellectually challenging, but lots of fun",7,12 January 2006,"This movie is a bit of fluff... but a nice bit of fluff! Surprisingly enjoyable and worth seeing if for no other reason but Shirley MacLane's delivery of some of her one liners. If you need a evening of just plain fun, this is the movie for you. Jennifer Anniston is surprisingly good, fresh, and believable. Shirley MacLane is hysterically funny. A real ""Old Pro"" who always delivers. Kevin Kostner is still sexy though he could do with a few less pounds around his middle. It's reminiscent of the 40's and 50's comedies a la Tracy/Hepburn or Cary Grant capers. Wish Hollywood would make more of this kind of movies and I wish that the critics wouldn't always pan them. Wanting to see something fun with no message or intellectual challenge is a perfectly legitimate reason for going to the movies...especially if the writing, acting and directing is good. And in this film it is!",Rumor Has It...
218,apestaartje_24,really really great!,10,12 January 2006,"It was a really great movie, I saw it yesterday with my mum at the movie theater, we had laughed and cried or eyes out from laughing!!! In particular Shirley Macclaine! She was really great.The scene with Kevin Kostner and her was funny, he had a problem with his fertility (is this correct spelling I don't know) and she made fun of it. Really funny, you should see it!! Off course Jennifer did a very good job! Very great movie! A 10 to me... At first I was a bit scared to see Jennifer again, I thought she remind me of Friends, I was scared that I should see Rachel in staid of Sarah. but that wasn't a problem at all! Mark Ruffalo also was in great shape, cute one. I can't remember that I saw this guy in any other movie. I am sure that he was, but I can't remember it. That blond girl that plays Annie have I seen before but she did play a good thing now, in previous movies she had not the best roles. You should all go and see it! It is worth it.",Rumor Has It...

During two-a-day practices, my thighs and butt cheeks would get chafed and raw and irritated. It was quite uncomfortable and painful. That's was more enjoyable than watching this movie. I can't believe this steaming pile of poo was ever made. Avoid it at all costs. There was nothing, and I mean nothing, enjoyable about it. Not funny, not endearing, not cute, not suspenseful. It sucks.",Rumor Has It...

221,javaroast,Horrible,1,23 May 2006,"I can barely think of the words to describe how horrible this movie was. I guess it's supposed to be a romantic-comedy, but it is neither romantic or funny. Shirley MacLaine was the only possible bright spot in this dreadful, creepy portrayal of a family that is all set for the Springer show. I guess I can only offer a comparison of how bad this actually was, so here is is. Gigli was a far better movie than this. Mighty Morphin Power Rangers has better acting than this movie. Debbie Does Dallas was more romantic than this movie and Schindler's list was better as comedy. This is bad on scale that we haven't seen since Ed Wood, and it doesn't have any of Mr. Wood's movies badness as a charm.Don't see it, don't rent it. If you do happen to rent it, please destroy the disk so that no on else has to go through the pain.",Rumor Has It...

Jen has proved she can do much more than Rachel, this is just a fun Romantic Comedy that she does in a way that only she can. Shirley Maclaine was terrific. It was well done and it didn't in any way ruin the Graduate. It was very entertaining. It kept me laughing throughout the film. I wasn't the only one laughing in the theatre i saw it in. It received a good deal of laughs and the audience seemed to have enjoyed it. I highly recommend this movie if you are looking for a romantic comedy.

223,christopherrv4400,good premise but like most current Hollywood outings Utterly utterly disappointing,3,24 June 2007,"simply put......the worst movie i have ever seen right up with there with ""Death becomes her"".the movie has no plot.whatsoever.the build up that takes place leads to a very disappointing and foregone conclusion.......true love triumphs and the rich guy never gets the girl.Now c'mm-on just because someone is rich dozen't necessarily mean he will have to be a playboy and is incapable of loving anyone seriously.and a person like Costner sleeping with the girls grand mother oh please.The movie could have been better if the rich guy actually triumphed and proved that all wealthy people are not idiots and the can fall in love.The movie was so disappointing....how could someone like an actor of Kevin Costner's reputation get involved in such trash......shame on you....shame on you too Shirley Mclane what were you thinking. and the director.....well his license should be revoked.And the ending the y just made love on that day.and the next and the next and the next.................to sum it up very very awful,Hollywood you are finished Even at comedies.",Rumor Has It...
224,sean-mcmillan,Bad Movie,1,3 July 2006,"This is simply the worst movie that I have seen in years. I was not only bored and unimpressed with everything in the movie, I was literally upset during it at both those who made the movie and the people I went to see the movie with for making me go see it. Please don't see it. The Graduate was an average movie to me, and this was supposed to based on that so right off the bat that is not a good sign. Jennifer Aniston can't carry a film which doesn't help the situation either. I would say this is Kevin Costner's worst movie since waterworld, and I would take waterworld over this any day. I paid $2 to go see this in the theatre, but I feel like I got screwed on that deal. They should have to pay people at least 20 bucks to go see this movie because otherwise it's just not worth your time. Go see gigli instead. I don't know what it's about and J. Lo and Ben Affleck are terrible actors, but it can't be much worse than this movie was. I think that we should be allowed to give a 0 out of 10 instead of just a 1, because that's what this deserves. All right that's enough ranting you get the idea. Don't see it or you'll be sorry.",Rumor Has It...
