0,MartinHafer,A romance featuring some ultra-crappy parenting and a child who is just too precocious to be real.,2,19 June 2015,"The set-up for this film is that a father is divorcing and his daughter, Maya, is asking him about how he met her mother. The guy then talks about a variety of women he dated and slept with as the child makes occasional commentary to interrupt the story. Some of her clever and charming remarks are calling one lady a B$%&@ and later, her father a slut. Later, when you learn which one of them is her mother, she announces that she 'just learned all about sexual intercourse in school'. Later, the child gives her now to be divorced father dating advice. Charming....NOT!I did not like this film, though the acting was very, very nice. As a retired psychotherapist, I thought that the boundaries between the child (who seemed way too old for her years) and her father were blurred. The adult here was not him, that's for sure. Additionally, there are a lot of political elements in the film (because he's a political operative)--not a bad thing in a drama, but not exactly something I want to see in a romantic film. Nothing destroys romance like politics!!Overall, I'd say 'nice try but no cigar'. This is a film that too flawed to be worth rushing out to see. It's strange father-daughter situation aside, the story just seemed way too with-it and hip in its parenting style for my tastes. To me, romance should be romantic...and this really wasn't. Additionally, the child seemed like a child as written by someone who's never even seen a child or talked with one! The DVD for ""Definitely, Maybe"" starts off very badly--and this might only be with the Netflix version. It forces you to watch a LONG preview for ""Mama Mia!""--whether you want to or not. I dunno about you, but this definitely makes me MUCH more inclined NEVER to watch a film they force you to preview...never.","Definitely, Maybe"
1,SnoopyStyle,Different kind of rom-com,8,28 November 2013,"Will Hayes (Ryan Reynolds) is an ad exec about to get divorced. After a particularly in depth discussion about sex in her school, he is harassed by his daughter Maya (Abigail Breslin) to talk about her mother. He finally relents but explains he's going to change the names and some of the facts. It becomes a story of ""How He Met Her Mother"" as he recounts past girlfriends Emily (Elizabeth Banks), April (Isla Fisher), and Summer (Rachel Weisz).It's a different kind of rom-com. There's the question of who the eventual girl in the equation is. The thing is all 3 ladies are absolutely charming actresses. So there isn't a bad choice in the bunch. It's more a cute device to keep interest in the story. Adam Brooks has written an unique rom-com. It also helps to have the charming Ryan Reynolds with the ever cute Abigail Breslin.","Definitely, Maybe"
2,jboothmillard,"Definitely, Maybe",3,18 June 2011,"I recognised the title as being in the particular genre, I didn't know anything about the plot or story, but even though the critics gave it a low rating I was willing to give it a chance. Basically in New York City, ten year old Maya Hayes (Little Miss Sunshine's Abigail Breslin) and all her fellow school student classmates attended their first sex education class, and the little girl is now fascinated to know about her parents. Her father Will (Ryan Reynolds) is in the process of getting a divorce, and Maya is insisting on hearing the story of how he met her birth mother, and he decides to change a few of the names so he doesn't reveal too much of the truth. In flashback, we see that Will found himself falling for three women, and he is telling the story in a way that his daughter can guess which one he would most fall in love with and of course give birth. So in flashback he moved from Madison, Wisconsin to New York, and the three women who could potentially be Maya's mother are his college sweetheart ""Emily"" (Elizabeth Banks), her New York based friend ""Summer Hartley"" (Rachel Weisz), and the New York campaign office copy girl ""April"" (Isla Fisher). Throughout the film he obviously has the usual past struggles with work and a family matter or two, but of course he bumps into these three women time and time again, so you are unsure which one will be Maya's mother. After the story has ended, the final and happy conclusion for Maya is that April is his birth mother, and also the only character in the story not to have their name changed. She realises her father Will still loves April, so the end of the film sees them go to her house and try to win her back, Maya almost acting as bait, and it does work, but the real happy ending Will said was Maya herself. Also starring Kevin Kline as Hampton Roth, Derek Luke as Russell T. McCormack, Alexie Gilmore as Olivia and Annie Parisse as Anne. Reynolds is okay, out of the three female characters that could potentially be a mother I personally was hoping it would be Weisz, and Breslin is reasonably cute but a little annoying. This is meant to have moments to make you laugh, I didn't find myself doing that almost all the way through, I found this dull and boring, a silly romantic comedy. Adequate!","Definitely, Maybe"
3,tavm,"Definitely, Maybe is a compelling romantic comedy for adults",8,7 August 2008,"Just watched this romantic comedy-about a divorced father (Ryan Reynolds) telling his daughter (Abigail Breslin) about her potential mother from three past lovers (Rachel Wiesz, Isla Fisher, Elizabeth Banks)-with my parents. We were all amused by some lines especially some concerning Bill Clinton since Reynolds plays someone who was involved in the former president's inaugural '92 campaign who later got disillusioned by his later scandal concerning Monica Lewinsky. There's even a sight of a Clinton lookalike jogging with his men in a later scene. Besides the players I just mentioned, there's also Kevin Kline who plays an grizzly author who is also involved in Wiesz's character. They all enact their characters in a compellingly believable fashion and while some may be alarmed with Ms. Breslin (who's 11 here) saying words like ""penis"" and ""vagina"" especially having come from a sex education class, it at least gets the Reynolds character to be a little honest about his relationships from before she was born though he stops when she asks what ""threesome"" means! And Ms. Fisher is the best of the three women in the flashback scenes as her character exposes her venerability as compared to her previous role in Wedding Crashers. So for anyone looking for a more adult romcom, I highly recommend Definitely, Maybe.","Definitely, Maybe"
4,edwagreen,"Definitely, not maybe-Positively! ***1/2",8,1 August 2009,"A wonderful story of 3 loves. A recently divorced father tells his daughter, the wonderful, precocious Abigail Breslin, the basic story of his love-life. The viewer is left to determine which is the woman he ultimately divorced and what is become of him.What makes this film so good is that it is told during the Clinton Administration, where we saw so many young people working feverishly for their candidate in 1992. We tried to mature during the Clinton Presidency so do our characters in this very delightful film.This is basically the story of a guy who can't seem to fulfill 3 love relationships that he has made during the course of the years gone by.","Definitely, Maybe"
5,evanston_dad,Saved By Isla Fisher,6,7 July 2008,"What ""Definitely, Maybe"" confirms more than anything is how utterly adorable and winning Isla Fisher is. She so utterly outshines everyone else in this movie that I grew impatient whenever the film veered away from her to focus on someone else. That Ryan Reynolds' character ultimately and predictably ends up with her at the end feels less like a romantic comedy convention and more like a complete no-brainer: ""DUH!"" Who wouldn't end up with Isla Fisher if he had the choice?""Definitely, Maybe"" is an all right movie, but it doesn't add up to much. It's one of those films where we watch our leading man (Reynolds in this case) stumble through a lot of relationship mistakes, act too immature for his age, and finally reach the conclusion the audience reached five minutes into the movie. I mostly just got tired of his drippy character and wanted him to stop acting like a petulant boy. I haven't decided yet whether or not Reynolds has what it takes to be a big star. He's certainly good looking enough, even if in a bland sort of way, and he has charm and presence. But he's missing an inherent something that would allow him to make a character like this likable even while he's being a baby, and without that, he just comes across as aggravating.The other two women in Reynolds' life are played by Rachel Weisz and Elizabeth Banks, and Kevin Kline shows up looking smelly and scraggly in what amounts to a series of rather pointless cameos. Abigail Breslin plays Reynolds' daughter, and while she's a cute enough little actress, I didn't for a second believe that she and Reynolds were really father and daughter.I can't say I was disappointed in this film, because I didn't expect it to be any more than it was, but without the performance of Isla Fisher, there really would have been no reason to watch it.Grade: B-","Definitely, Maybe"
6,ferguson-6,Not Everyday People,6,17 February 2008,"Greetings again from the darkness. No question the audience for this one is all those women who hold onto the belief that no matter the past, Mr. Right will somehow re-discover what he missed the first time around and come bounding back in and swoop them away in a sea of romance.Sampling a bit from the horribly weak ""Serendipity"", writer/director Adam Brooks does deliver his best film to date (don't get too excited). Premise is interesting, though hardly believable. Wise beyond her years Abigail Breslin (""Little Miss Sunshine"") demands that her recently divorced dad (Ryan Reynolds) tell her the story of his love life and how he came to be as miserable as she thinks he is. With breaks in storytelling similar to ""The Princess Bride"" (remember little Fred Savage and Peter Falk?), Reynolds proceeds to recount how he blew it with three beautiful and intelligent women over the course of his adult life.Undeniably, the best parts of the film involve the extraordinary performances by these three ladies: Elizabeth Banks, Rachel Weisz and Isla Fisher. I am still astounded that Ms. Banks doesn't get cast more often. I put her in the Gretchen Mol category for most underutilized talent. Although I am not usually a fan of Ms. Weisz, she avoids any temptation to overact here ... even in her scenes with Kevin Kline. She is actually somewhat charming and affecting until her moment of truth. Isla Fisher (""Wedding Crashers"") is the new Meg Ryan. She is enchanting and believable in her role as April. The movie perks up when she is on screen.Not sure what to say about Abigail Breslin. She can deliver a stunning line of dialogue like few other child actors. Looking forward to seeing where her career takes her over the next 10 years. On the other hand, I do know what to say about Ryan Reynolds. This dude apparently went to the Hayden Christensen school of acting. He has the blank face down ... except that seems to be his only look. It appears he really didn't understand the story, just memorized his lines. He is the perfect example that eye candy with nothing in the middle just keeps sucking.The story will interest many women and any guy that gets dragged along will at least enjoy the trio of talented ladies.","Definitely, Maybe"
7,anaconda-40658,Definitely Great!,9,1 May 2015,"Definitely, Maybe (2008): Dir: Adam Brooks / Cast: Ryan Reynolds, Rachel Weisz, Elizabeth Banks, Isla Fisher, Abigail Breslin: Romantic comedy about decisions within relationships. Ryan Reynolds plays a single father who tells his daughter about the identity of her mother. He tells of college girlfriend played by Elizabeth Banks who chooses not to join him in New York. Rachel Weisz plays Banks's former roommate who is currently rooming with an author. Isla Fisher plays a copy girl whom he meets at his campaign headquarters. Director Adam Brooks is backed by a clever ending despite having a formula structure but perhaps the film's best asset is the mystery upon who the target female is. Brooks skillfully makes all parties appear to be possible mothers. Reynolds plays off a loving father who has been in a few relationships yet his daughter currently remains his top priority. All three female leads bring identifiable persona to the material. Banks brings the excitement of college free spirit. Weisz provides the promise of continual love. Isla Fisher is the potential for opportunity and possible future. All three present different mood all the while being the perpetrator to which the mystery is based. Finally there is Abigail Breslin as the daughter curious as to where she came from and who is partially responsible. Otherwise it definitely displays the venture to love. Score: 9 / 10","Definitely, Maybe"
8,HotToastyRag,Not really necessary,4,12 May 2020,"With Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell as the original story of a girl who doesn't know which of three possible candidates is her father, and Mamma Mia! as the musical version of the same story, why was it necessary to create Definitely, Maybe? This romantic comedy twists the story on its ear, and it's not a very comfortable position.Ryan Reynolds is waiting for his soon-to-be ex-wife to pick up their daughter, Abigail Breslin, and during the down-time, he decides to tell Abby a story. It's not Cinderella or Snow White, but instead the story of how he and her mother fell in love. He tells of his escapades with three separate women, and asks Abby which she thinks is the story about her mother. In the meantime, the audience sees three actresses (Isla Fisher, Elizabeth Banks, and Rachel Weisz) portrayed in the stories, but we're not exposed to the identity of the real mother.I don't find that plot compelling. In the first place, most children don't care about their parents' backstories, so Abby wouldn't become engrossed in her dad's tale. In the second, since her parents are getting a divorce, and since children aren't capable of understanding divorce, Abby wouldn't get excited about hearing how her parents fell in love when the entire reason her world has turned upside down is because they fell out of love. In the third, it's a universal theme (and it may be sexist, but it's the truth) that trying to find out the identity of one's father is more interesting than one's mother. The mother is forced to stick around and raise the child; the father can leave if he wants to. Unless this is a story of an adopted girl coming across three potential files of women who gave up their babies on the same day, it's not very interesting. And how is it supposed to be seen as good parenting to talk about three women as a way of explaining why you're divorcing one of them?","Definitely, Maybe"
9,zetes,"Sweet and nice, but not particularly memorable",6,6 July 2008,"A romance with a bit more intelligence than the average one, a little more heartfelt and one that has a very likable and non-stereotypical man at its center. He is played by Ryan Reynolds, most famous for his role as Van Wilder, but surprisingly good as a romantic lead, and the movie is about him telling the story of how he met his wife (from whom he is getting a divorce) to his young daughter (Abigail Breslin). There were three major women in his life, and he changes their names so the daughter can't guess which one is her mother. The three women are played by Elizabeth Banks, Isla Fisher and Rachel Weisz. He falls in love with each of them at different times, but always at the wrong time. At times, this is a very sweet movie, and not very cloying. Unfortunately, it's never all that engaging, either. It offers some simple pleasures, but it was, overall, pretty forgettable. I also didn't care for the flashback structure much. Some of the stuff that is apparently being narrated to his daughter is stuff a girl of her age, who incidentally just learned the term ""sexual intercourse"" the same day at school, doesn't need to hear. When the girl has to stop the story to ask what a threesome is, your story might have gotten a bit too graphic. That gag was certainly more disturbing than funny.","Definitely, Maybe"
10,DICK STEEL,"A Nutshell Review: Definitely, Maybe",10,13 April 2008,"One guy and the four loves of his life. Writer-director Adam Brooks paints a very romantic tale that I could have seen some personal relation to, and reinforces the notion that perhaps timing is everything. You may have met the most perfect person whom you believe to be able to forge a relationship with, but circumstances sometimes will decide otherwise, and when it happens, it's way beyond one's control.Abigail Breslin burst onto the scene with Little Miss Sunshine, and hasn't been looking back since. Given Dakota Fanning's been past her age for such roles (yeah, they disappear come adolescent and may return once they enter young adulthood), Breslin's now having the world fawn over her performances (next up, Nim's Island), and here she has great chemistry with Ryan Reynolds, even if Reynolds might look a little too young to be playing her dad.But Definitely, Maybe's not all about Breslin as it serves more of a romantic comedy with Ryan Reynolds taking on the lead man-boy role as the father who has to satisfy the curiosity of his daughter Maya (Breslin), who's given a headstart in life thanks to a rather candidly explicit sexual education lesson. In wanting to find out if she's an accident because of her parent's impending divorce, she gets her dad to recount his love life history in a romance- mystery, changing names in order for her to guess who her mom is.And so begins a tale which harks back to college days where most of us have their perennial sweetheart, and from there we follow Will Hayes (Reynolds) as he goes to New York to work on the Democrat ticket for Bill Clinton's election. Then on he meets the other 2 lovers April (Isla Fisher), the photocopy girl who bickers and banters with him in office, and Summer (Rachel Weisz), who's into much older men. It's probably easy for me to connect with the messy love life of Will's as he flits into and out of favour and love with all three women at one point in time or another, what with his long distance relationship not working out with Emily (Elizabeth Banks), having sharing instant connection with April but they're always seeing different partners and being unavailable, and with Summer, it boiled down to professional differences having to take its toil on the relationship, because one's not willing to sacrifice for the other. I thought these were really real issues that would creep in and how well it works out, will again depend on timing and circumstances.But the mystery portion turned out to be somewhat a letdown as it was abruptly solved, perhaps knowing that the game is up and there's nothing else interesting to hold it down together. That doesn't detract the movie from moving on to the more important last act though, which I found to be immensely moving, well, again based on personal reflection on what could be. The other moment that stood out (I told you this was quite personal) was that bit on the brushing of the hair. I remembered quite clearly I was on the receiving end of something like that too, which took me by pleasant surprise when it happened. It's easy too with Will, as his taking a hiatus from the dating scene to focus on his professional life, resembled my mindset at some stage too.Anyway, what also made the movie stand out, was its setting in and weaving through the 90s tracing Bill Clinton's rise and fall, a period where I and some of you, grew up in, what with all the pop culture of the time referenced, as well as the music. The soundtrack's peppered with songs that defined the era (Nirvana, anyone?) and having Massive Attack on it, is always a massive boost for me since they're one of my favourite trip-hop bands. A Clint Mansell score on top of it all, makes this movie musically a breeze to sit through.Definitely, maybe a winner? But of course! It's definitely highly recommended, and goes into my books as a contender for movie of the year since I enjoyed so many moments of it, cheesy goosebumps and all. Oh, and I would surely welcome and get for myself those wireless earphones.","Definitely, Maybe"
11,siderite,A nice romance story that doesn't have to be a comedy,8,4 September 2008,"Aren't you tired of all those romcoms with the guy and the girl and the comic relief when it gets too close to reality? Fortunately, this movie is not one of those. It is a romantic life time-line from the viewpoint of one guy, telling the story to his nagging preteen daughter.The acting is good, the story is complex, yet close to home and, most of all, it is all real. Not in the sense that it happened in real life, but that it is not far fetched, not sugar coated, not overly dramatized.I recommend it both to young and averagely aged couples, because it talks about unrealistic dreams, about real life falling in love, about how people connect, but not in the same time, about dealing with heart break without getting all depressed and surrounded by gay friends :).Bottom line: it's a romance for couples, but from the standpoint of a guy, an average Joe.","Definitely, Maybe"
12,Smells_Like_Cheese,Definitely Watchable,7,28 February 2008,"When I first saw the trailer for Definitely, Maybe, it looked like an alright film that was probably just your average Valentine's Day love fest movie. But I got to see it for free, if the price is right, why not? So I watched it and actually I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. Ryan Renolds, I love the guy in comedies, I haven't seen him in drama, so I was a little skeptical, but after seeing Definitely, Maybe, he pulled in a good performance that surprised me. The only thing I have to say I was a little disappointed in was Abigail Breslin, her performance in Little Miss Sunshine was wonderful and heart warming, Definitely, Maybe didn't bring in her best performance, who knows? It could've been the script or director, but she pulls a decent enough performance to where the movie works and puts a different twist on the average romantic comedy.Will Hayes has it all, a great paying job, a beautiful daughter, Maya, and a nice home, but unfortunately he is getting divorced. Maya comes over and wonders how he and her mom met. Will keeps saying no, but after tons of begging, he finally decides to go ahead and tell her. But he puts a little twist, since he went through a few women before her mom came along, he tells her the whole story, but through three women, Maya has to solve the love story mystery and find out who her mother is.Definitely, Maybe was different than the average romantic comedy and that's what I liked about it, it seemed also like it was just more real and not what women should have expectations about. It goes through the serious up's and down's of a relationship, the on and off's as well. The cast did a good job of pulling the film together and making the film very decent. I would recommend Definitely, Maybe, it's worth the watch and was a pleasant movie to see.7/10","Definitely, Maybe"
13,Buddy-51,better than average romantic comedy,6,31 May 2009,"In ""Definitely, Maybe,"" Will Hayes (Ryan Reynolds) is a single dad whose young daughter (Abigail Breslin) insists that he make like Sheherazade and relate the tales of his former lovers so she can decide which of them is most likely to be her mother (think of it as a ""Mamma Mia"" in reverse). The potential candidates include Emily (Elizabeth Banks), his longtime girlfriend when he lived in Wisconsin; April (Isla Fisher), an apolitical Kurt Cobain and ""Jane Eyre"" freak; and Summer (Rachel Weisz), a magazine writer and friend of Emily. Thus, after an intro set in the present, the movie turns back the clock to 1992 when Hayes, then an aspiring politician, moved from Wisconsin to New York City to work on the first Clinton presidential campaign. It is there that he meets April and Summer (though May and Autumn fail to make an appearance).Although the ""Who's my mommy?"" premise makes absolutely no sense whatsoever in the context of the story, ""Definitely, Maybe"" is still a cut or two above your average romantic comedy thanks to a screenplay by director Adam Brooks that generally respects the intelligence of its audience and to an appealing performance by Reynolds who carries the film with his easygoing demeanor and charm. The actresses all turn in fine performances as well, although Breslin occasionally sets the teeth on edge with her precocity and calculated cuteness (luckily, she's not on screen all that much). And as an extra added bonus, the movie offers up one of the snazziest and jazziest title sequences in recent memory.The movie does get the year wrong on the Monica Lewinsky scandal (identifying it as 1997 instead of 1998), but the references to the politics of the '90s that continuously play out in the background are fun for those who look back with fondness and nostalgia on what now seems to be a more halcyon era.","Definitely, Maybe"
14,Robert_duder,"Really sweet, cute and surprisingly intelligent romantic comedy!",8,10 March 2008,"I think it's been a really long time since I saw and truly enjoyed a good romantic comedy. The days of Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks are long behind us and a lot of the romantic comedies nowadays don't fit the bill. I think maybe my expectations for Definitely, Maybe were a little low, I didn't really think it would be mind blowing and yet when I saw it I was very, very pleasantly surprised. First and foremost Definitely, Maybe is smart...really smart. It's not stereotypical or even predictable which is really impressive for that genre. They found a really good way to break the romantic comedy predictably aspect. Everyone has really good chemistry together and really you're sharing different romance stories all rolled into one and in some ways you kind of get to experience two different kind of endings. Just when I thought they had taken the ending in a way that disappointed me, they pulled it back around so that I got the ending that I think it should have had. All around it was just really fun, and sweet, and very intelligent and just great to watch. Director Adam Brooks hasn't had a lot of directing experience but he has had a lot of writing experience...some good and some bad.I think Ryan Reynolds is one of Hollywood's hottest young commodities. He has incredible screen presence, a very versatile, funny actor who can really act (his amazing performance in The Amityville Horror remake---see my review) Reynolds shows more versatility in Definitely, Maybe as the lonely single Dad who tells his daughter the story of his experiences in young love. Reynolds is just very watchable, very down to earth, funny and quirky and just easy to watch. He's great. Abigail Breslin plays his daughter. Now I know a lot of people who really don't care for Breslin. They find her annoying and she is in everything but in all fairness I think she is coming into her own as an actor. She is talented and looks the proper parts and I think we're only going to see more from her. She's not overused in this film but just enough to make her really enjoyable in the role. The three girls play their roles very, very well. They all have very different personalities and the goal is to really drive the audience in a certain direction with the girls. Elizabeth Banks is Emily, Reynolds' first girlfriend. Banks is meant to see like the perfect girl but also be flawed. They have good chemistry but something is missing and that's exactly what they are aiming for oddly enough. The lovely Rachel Weisz is free spirited Summer Hartley. Weisz doesn't really fit in with the other girls but again maybe that's the idea. Her and Reynolds have okay chemistry but it isn't the true romance. Isla Fisher is April and I think the key girl in this strange four way romance. I just immediately liked her and I hoped that she was the one that was his true love. They had the best chemistry, she was smart, and savvy and just really good in her role. She got the best of Reynolds which I think any good woman should in a romance.The main characters didn't have the stereotypical romantic comedy 'best friends' at their sides because there was already four main characters fighting for the romance. As a fan of politics I also admit that I really liked the bit of political spin on the story however small and insignificant it might be. I liked Reynolds and his back story and the film is focused in the nineties when he's really coming of age and somehow they make the nineties feel like a whole new era with the Clinton administration and the election and the early controversies and smoking when smoking was still somewhat okay...it was just a clever spin to give it a different setting. The final note is that this is really one of the most unique and fun romantic comedies out there and the cast is terrific and it's not very often you can find a romance that breaks the mold and this one does it!! 8.5/10","Definitely, Maybe"
15,ThomasDrufke,"Sometimes It's a Matter of ""When"" and Not ""Who""",9,22 April 2020,"In a similar vein to La La Land and 500 Days of Summer, Definitely Maybe deals with relationships in a surprising real and touching way. These films have a way of representing love in a way that mostly depends on timing and where you are in your life. I've always loved the idea that sometimes love is more a matter of 'when' then it is about 'who' comes into your life and Definitely Maybe certainly covers that brilliantly. It also serves as an example of how good Ryan Reynolds can be in more dramatic heavy films. This is a must watch.9.1/10","Definitely, Maybe"
16,MLDinTN,nothing says good parenting like...,4,25 December 2008,"letting your child guess which girlfriend became her mother. Will Hayes is going through a divorce and his young daughter,Maya, starts asking questions. He decides to tell her a bedtime story about his previous girlfriends and changes their names. Maya must guess which one became her mother. Sounds like a great game uh. Once you get over this ultra liberal point of view, the rest of the movie is just OK. Will had 3 girlfriends: one was his high school/college sweetheart, one was a co-worker when he worked on Bill Clinton's campaign, and the third was a journalist whom was having an affair with her professor. Will has good times with each woman and also times where they break up. At the very end Will discovers whom the true love of his life was.FINAL VERDICT: Nothing memorable. I wouldn't suggest renting it.","Definitely, Maybe"
17,gbill-74877,Charming,9,5 January 2018,"I've always had a soft spot for this one, and well done romantic comedies in general. Yes, they are lightning rods for criticism, sometimes bordering on schmaltz and/or formulaic. However, 'Definitely, Maybe' avoids all that reasonably well, and is as entertaining for me as the classic films of this genre from yesteryear, with a script peppered with funny lines, a great cast, and an endearing plot. A young girl (Abigail Breslin) demands that her father (Ryan Reynolds) tell her about the time he met her mother, and why it is that despite falling in love then, they're now heading for divorce. Reynolds agrees under the condition he won't reveal which of the women in the story of his past ultimately became her mother. Told in a flashback, we see his early years working on the Bill Clinton presidential campaign, and the women in his life (Elizabeth Banks, Isla Fisher, and Rachel Weisz). All of the principals turn in strong performances, with Isla Fisher in particular dialing up her considerable charms. The subplot of collecting old editions of 'Jane Eyre' with inscriptions in them, along with the scene with the line ""I kept the book because it was the only thing that I had left of you"" is touching. The proposal scene in Central Park is also fantastic. Director Adam Brooks captures some great shots in New York and includes a great soundtrack. This is a smart, funny, and entertaining rom-com.","Definitely, Maybe"
18,g-bodyl,A Pleasant Surprise!,9,16 July 2013,"Definitely, Maybe surprised me on how a great film it is despite being labeled as a romantic comedy. All these rom coms made nowadays are not fresh, but this one is. I also liked how the plot not took place over a few weeks or months, but over a course of almost twenty years. We really got to see how the personalities of each character changed over the years.Adam Brooks film is about a political consultant who works in New York City during the Bill Clinton campaign and how he goes through all these relationships which don't work our for him. Flash forward to 2008, he tells his daughter his account of these relationships and there he may find a second chance.The acting is pretty good. I really like Ryan Reynolds. He is a charming fellow and I liked the way he spoke with his daughter. Abigail Breslin is a delight to watch as she gets older and delves into more mature roles. Kevin Kline was excellent and quite funny. Isla Fisher and Rachel Weisz were great supplements for Reynolds.Overall, this is an above-average romantic comedy that is fresh, sweet, and emotionally-charged. Yes, it has some politics involved but I wish people would talk about the film instead of the boring liberal vs. conservative nonsense. This is also a great film to watch with your significant other. I rate this film 9/10.","Definitely, Maybe"
19,lesleyharris30,"A Surprisingly Unpredictable Romantic Comedy,",6,18 June 2016,"Definitely Maybe is a good movie with a well developed plot and a great comedic cast. It's an enjoyable, original romantic comedy that, despite its premise, is actually not predictable, it is genuinely intriguing for us as an audience to find out who ends up being Maya's mother. Ryan Reynold's brings in excellent charm in the lead role and seems to have instant chemistry with the all the main actresses, particularly Isla Fisher and Rachel Weisz. The plot can be a bit convoluted at times and had several plot points that felt unnecessary, such as making Bill Clinton's run as president a major part of the story, it took me away from this movie when they began speaking about real events. I would love to have seen more of Hampton, Kevin Kline's brief portrayal of the character was funny and natural, I think he really could have added another layer to the film if he had a bigger role.

20,A_Different_Drummer,One of the best rom-coms EVER,9,7 September 2014,"Hollywood and its relentless bias for quantity not quality has made cynics of us all. In the case of this lost gem, it is no coincidence that (as of the date this review is penned) the top rated IMDb critique basically says that the writer was expecting junk ... and yet was pleasantly surprised.Sterling praise, that.Folks we need to (sorry for the pun) look at the big picture here. The Romcom is a tried and true Hollywood tradition that goes back to the days of ... oh ... Claudette Colbert and Doris Day.When it doesn't work, it is usually still entertaining; and when it does work, it is magical. This one is magical.Forget the cynicism for a moment and you will see the all the components are there: the writing is so sharp it cuts (especially the last scene with the door speaker); the direction is gentle and unobtrusive, and all the actors (ALL!) are excellent and engaging.Ryan Renolds, if you can look past the career error known as Green Lantern, is a natural romantic lead, engaging and always moving forward, taking the viewer along. Since this is a story about a man looking for Mrs. Right, the female players have to sexy enough to appeal to the male viewer yet still relatable and sympatico for the distaff members of the audience. Again, spot on.Isla Fisher may possibly have given the performance of her career here because she is required to build a presence in a movie where she is offscreen most of the time. And she pulls it off. Which in turn makes the ending that much more fun.","Definitely, Maybe"
21,inkblot11,"Definitely a winner, there is no maybe about it, but do not expect a laughfest, as some tears may arrive on your face",8,1 March 2008,"Will Hayes (Ryan Reynolds) is on the verge of divorce. The papers arrive at his advertising office, where he has just been lauded for a winning sales pitch. Thus, it is a bittersweet moment. What really matters to Will is his much-cherished daughter, Maya (Abigail Breslin) and the portions of the week that he is now alloted to spend with her. As it is his day to pick her up at school and keep her overnight, Will enters the school building to find it in chaos. His daughter's class has just had a sex education lesson and everyone is in an uproar, shouting out anatomical bits of vocabulary and wondering if their parents ""do it."" As he takes Maya home, the conversation turns more to love than love-making and Will decides to tell Abigail the story of how he met her mother. But, since the tale involves a couple of past girlfriends, too, it becomes what Maya calls a love-story mystery. It seems Will worked on a political campaign in New York City, leaving one girlfriend, Emily (Elizabeth Banks) behind in Wisconsin, though they swore allegiance to each other. From there, he met a free-spirited campaign worker, April (Isla Fisher) and a political writer named Summer (Rachel Weisz). So, which one became Maya's mother, after years of love, laughter, and tears? This is a very nice film, full of romance, humor, relevance, and reality. The path to true love is sometimes quite rocky, as it is here, and it is possible to have more than one ""great"" amour in a lifetime. Reynolds, a first-rate comedian (see the delightful Just Friends), proves here that he is capable in handling dramatic material, too, and charming Breslin continues to show why she is one of the most lauded child stars ever. Banks, although quite pretty, doesn't stick out in a crowded field of women, but Weisz is very attractive and distinctive in her role as the writer while Fisher shines brightly as one of life's funny, vagabond princesses with a huge heart. The rest of the cast, including the fine Derek Luke, is well chosen. In my view, too, you will love the costumes, the scenery in and around Manhattan, and the polished look of the film, as well as the winning script and direction. All in all, this is a definite winner, not a maybe hit. Therefore, take appropriate action and get thyself to a theater soon. Oh, and watch out for the very creative opening credits, where the use of revolving montages and lettering, all done to Sly and the Family's Stone's Everday People, is most impressive.","Definitely, Maybe"
22,tabuno,The New Mainstream Family Drama,8,21 January 2019,"7 March 2008. This heart-warming and contemporary family drama reaches out and presents a strong performance and script on the life of one man and his various serious relationships (not necessarily being serious all the time) in his life as well as his efforts to become a Presidential speech writer. In many ways, Will Hayes (played by Ryan Reynolds) has a typical but fascinating life as he meets and plays with and struggles with the ""complicating"" life of relationships. This movie avoids the stereotypes and deals mostly from the heart, both of Will Hayes as well as the women he meets and the daughter he eventually has and to whom he is telling the story of his life. It's a compelling journey of change and transformation for both those on the journey as well as for those who are in the now telling and hearing the story. At first the absence of a background story on Mr. Hayes first relationship is suspect is plays out well in the end. The major problem with the movie is how the script deals with Maya Hayes (played by Abigail Breslin) and the revelation of who her mother truly is that seems to be somewhat disjointed and confusing towards the end of the movie. Nevertheless, DEFINITELY, MAYBE builds on the solid work of NANNY DIARIES from last. Reviewed 3/7/08. Eight out of Ten Stars.","Definitely, Maybe"
23,Floated2,Decent but also somewhat boring,4,18 September 2010,"This film seemed to have a very creative and original way in storytelling. From the trailers, it looked like an unusual romantic comedy type. And it looked somewhat interesting. To film started out pretty awkward. It shows Ryan Reynolds (Will Hayes) going to pickup his child daughter and it appears that there is a lot of commotion from parents and children screaming. They were learning sexed-ed, which was odd because of the age of the children. We then see the kid and see her speaking her language and using profanity. From this instinct we can immediately tell that he is a spoiled loud bratty annoying child. We later notice that she wants to know about her father's past relationships because he is currently getting a divorce with his wife. The film is basically a flashback fantasy story in which Will tells about his 3 main relationships with Emily, April, Summer. The films starts off awkward but seems interesting and entertaining then toward the part of the film when he meets April (photo copy girl) it goes downhill and because more boring and confusing. What is also weird is that his stories are from 1992-1997 yet everyone looks exactly the same, even the clothes are the same. The only notable difference is that they show footage of Bill Clinton and & George Bush. They could have done a better done making it look like it was from the past. It was boring because his job was that he was a person working in a job for the presidents in a large company and they were mostly speaking of politics, the government and presidency. The ending was also weird, they showed the daughters mother and she just on went on. In the end he ends up choosing the female most cruel, rude and disrespectful. I disliked the ending a lot. That should have been changed to him choosing Emily (the mother) so that they can fixed the problems and raise their child.==================================================================== ====================================================================As a rewatch (08/11/17') this film remains as one remembers it when first saw the film. A unique and interesting premise but overall a story which is lacking in any suspense, thrills or moments that really stand out. The ending and overall plot is quite predictable, and the film isn't as funny. The film is brought down by a lousy and annoying performance by the daughter and too sappy of a romantic story line. Though we could understand as to why some critics and fans alike this film as it may bring a sense of nostalgia to their lives.","Definitely, Maybe"
24,howard.schumann,Bad writing equals bad parenting,5,10 December 2008,"One of the rules of good parenting is to always remember that you are the parent, not the buddy or the pal. Once you put your son or daughter on the same level as you, you forfeit the authority that allows you to govern the household.This lesson is lost, however, on writer-director Adam Brooks and his main character, advertising executive Will Hayes (Ryan Reynolds) in the romantic comedy ""Definitely, Maybe."" On the verge of divorce, Will delves back into his romantic past to try to figure out what went wrong and tells his visiting 11-year-old daughter Maya (Abigail Breslin) a bedtime story - the painful details of his failed love life.The film opens with Maya, fresh out of sex education classes, spouting details about thrusting penises into vaginas and pressing dad for details about the women he ""rehearsed"" with before he met mom. Changing the names of his three girlfriends, dad turns it into a parlor game in which Maya must guess who her mother is, hard as it is to believe that she would have no idea how her parents met or know her mother's background. The film then flashes back to 1992 where we meet Will volunteering for the ""Clinton for President"" campaign, two idealists heading for a romantic train wreck.Soon we are introduced to Will's previous lovers: college girlfriend Emily (Elizabeth Banks) whom he meets in Madison, Wisconsin before heading off to New York; April (Isla Fischer), a perky copy girl in the Clinton campaign whose age and facial expressions do not change throughout the film even though 16 years have elapsed; and Summer (Rachel Weisz) a former classmate of Emily now a sophisticated journalist presently involved with womanizer Hampton Roth (Kevin Kline), her much older thesis adviser and a political analyst. The three relationships consist mostly of Will getting dumped and then coming back for more punishment.As the bedtime fairy tale continues, Will raises tons of money for the Clinton campaign, then starts his own consulting company with partner and friend Derek Luke. At the same time, mirrored by nasty TV footage of Clinton's escapades in the 90s, Will cannot seem to maintain a healthy long term relationship with any of his eligible women. Though the dialogue strains for wit and topicality, nothing rings true and the film meanders from one cliché to another. Along the way, the viewer and pre-teen Maya are forced to revisit Gennifer Flowers, Monica Lewinsky, hear about threesomes, lesbian group sex, and professors seducing their students -- all presumably appropriate for an 11-year old.The parlor game of ""is she or isn't she my mother?"" has a limited shelf life and, by the time the girlfriends have disappeared and then reappeared into Will's life ad nauseum, most of us have either long figured out the film's puzzle or could care less. While some have called ""Definitely, Maybe"" an example of the movies over sexualizing of children, to me it is more of an exercise in bad writing and bad directing with the ending as inappropriate as the beginning. Released on Valentine's Day, the film's only value may be as a primer of what to avoid in relationships, parenting, and need I add -- movie-going.","Definitely, Maybe"
25,matthewssilverhammer,Corny Snooze,4,12 June 2018,"I really like Reynolds here; he's more restrained and soulful, but still is given his moments to breakout into his snark schtick. Otherwise, this is a corny snooze. How many times must we watch characters reacquaint themselves to each other? Why can't any two characters ever love each other at the same time? It's all incredibly frustrating, with dashes of cuteness strewn throughout.","Definitely, Maybe"
26,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"The setup might feel cheap, it's an engaging, usually sincere romantic tale",7,28 June 2012,"There's not a lot of mystery in romantic comedies, aside from perhaps ""who's the baby daddy?"" which is coincidentally not too far off from the hook Adam Brooks uses in his film ""Definitely, Maybe.""There's a comfort in the romantic comedy formula, in the predictable end of a tried romance. We derive a bit of pleasure as a romance plot drags us along the string of ""will they or won't they?"" even though we know in our hearts what will happen (because if it doesn't happen, our hearts will be broken and the movie will get bad-mouthed).""Definitely, Maybe"" does as good a job of any rom-com at doing just that. We are sucked into the story with a premise nearly identical to CBS sitcom ""How I Met Your Mother,"" in which young Maya (Abigail Breslin) presses her father, Will, (Ryan Reynolds) into telling the story of how he met her mom. Seeing as the couple is a pair of signatures away from a divorce, he's not thrilled at the prospect of reliving those moments, but for our entertainment, he indulges.The catch, of course, is that the story involves multiple women, and Maya must guess which one turns out to be her mother. Thus begins a long story that begins in 1992, when young(er) Will sets out for New York City to work on the Clinton campaign and leaves his serious girlfriend, whom he refers to as Emily (Elizabeth Banks), behind.The '90s American history backdrop definitely gives the film its own flavor. Brooks eventually tries to draw an analogy to the former president, but it's half-hearted. Nonetheless, Brooks uses the opportunity to take an amusing jab at President George W. Bush among other humorous moments of hindsight and it's a welcome aspect of the story.On the job he meets the copy girl (Isla Fisher), April, one of the mother candidates. She's into rock music and edgier guys, and despite an attraction, things never seem to fall into place for them.Then there's the woman referred to as Summer (Rachel Weisz), a sophisticated and confident aspiring journalist Will becomes particularly passionate about and eventually starts dating.So will it be Bachelorette No. 1, 2 or 3? Brooks definitely spent some time crafting this story to constantly bounce back and forth between the women as Will encounters them at multiple points in his life, constantly casting doubt over each one. The three actresses are stellar as well, so it really helps that even if you pick side, you kind of like all the characters for different reasons.Reynolds holds up well as a romantic lead. He's a rather passive participant in his own love life, which is a bit frustrating but endearing. You genuinely root for his happiness despite fully understanding just why his love life has been so flawed. The impact it has on Maya is also sweet in all its obvious nature. She becomes as engrossed in the story as we do, though with a child-like innocence. Eventually she realizes that love really is as complicated as they say.The riddle doesn't last nearly as long as it could, but for a romantic comedy it lasts longer than most. At some point the characters have been so fleshed out and certain details put in play that you can start to put the pieces together and figure out exactly how it will end. To Brooks' credit, however, he made what will be seen as a popular choice.""Definitely, Maybe"" hits all over the rom-com spectrum if the left end represents fabrication and tons of cheese and the right is honesty, realism and poignancy. There's a rather cloying scene in which Will and April hang out on April's birthday after her boyfriend ditches her for a gig and the tension is forced and painful, but there are also some extremely normal relationship dynamics at play in Will and Summer's relationship.The film does the balancing act of fantasy and reality quite well. If all rom-coms were brutally honest, we wouldn't see many of them if any off the indie circuit. ""Definitely, Maybe"" is pretty much mostly sincere, however, and it's mystery hook — though contrived — is sorta certainly the key to making it all work.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Ryan Reynolds is like Jim Carrey all over again as he is so boring to watch yet I saw him in The Proposal with Sandra Bullock & Just Friends which was hilarious but I found his performance here kinda crap.The ending was kinda weird too as it was kinda confusing but having said that it isn't your average romantic comedy.","Definitely, Maybe"

It's like this movie couldn't decide what it wanted to be, a comedy or a drama. And what happened to Ryan Reynolds here, He managed to save two bad movies from extermination, with his comic timing, and his playful wittiness, and the films I'm talking about are Blade:Trinity(2004), and Waiting(2005), which would not be memorable if not for him, but he just did not have it this time around, it appears for this film, he just quit trying to be impressive. He plays Will Hayes, a thirty something political consultant, who's going through a divorce, one day decides to tell his 11 year old daughter(played with such charm by Abigail Breslin) on his life, and how he met her mother. Has it goes through the 90's. And it goes through 3 possibilities, Rachel Weisz, Elizabeth Banks, and lsla Fisher. But I grew weary has the journey went on, It really became too predicable . I left this film feeling depressed, and annoyed. Although moments between Reynolds and Breslin are sweet, and the three actress's do alright also.

31,EUyeshima,A Clintonesque Rom-com?...Maybe More Than Definitely,6,29 July 2008,"Coming across as a breezy cross between Tom Hanks and Will Ferrell, Ryan Reynolds (""Just Friends"") is a likable enough presence in this 2008 romantic comedy, but he simply lacks enough gravitas to be the compelling core of this story. While he doesn't suffer from the same degree of adolescent smugness plaguing Ashton Kutcher, Reynolds has one of those pliable personalities that fail to leave an indelible mark on the screen, which is too bad since the role requires someone who can ground the story at the same time he can elevate those around him. Fortunately, director/writer Adam Brooks doesn't leave his leading man high and dry since he cast three solid actresses as his various love interests, as well as the omnipresent Abigail Breslin (""Little Miss Sunshine"") as his doting daughter.The time-flipping plot revolves around a bedtime story that soon-to-be-divorced political consultant Will Hayes tells his ten-year-old daughter Maya. Unaware of her parents' lives before their marriage, Maya wants to hear about their romance with an interest in sparking memories that will hopefully make him change his mind about the divorce. Since two other women play pivotal roles in his past, Will suddenly decides to change the names of all the people in his account, thus leaving Maya to guess which one is her mother. It's a charming gimmick but a gimmick nonetheless, which gives rise to the inevitable flashbacks. Surprisingly, this is where the film exceeds my expectations as it begins with Will leaving behind college sweetheart Emily in Wisconsin to work on Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign. Brooks smartly draws parallels between the young idealist in Will and the imperfect public hero that Clinton became. In fact, this may be the first rom-com with a protagonist mirroring the emotional compromises felt during the Clinton years.But make no mistake that this is a rom-com that can't wait to introduce romantic complications. First, there is Emily's friend and former lover Summer, an ambitious journalist already in a relationship with her thesis adviser Hampton Roth, a renowned and quite arrogant author. Her affection, however, comes at a price when it becomes a conflict of interest for Will. Then there's April, an underachieving free-spirit who runs the copier at the campaign office. Timing is the chief problem connecting these two as April shows more interest in friendship initially, while Will is inevitably unavailable whenever they consider connecting. Needless to say, things sort themselves out, but Brooks provides enough plot curves to make it all reasonably enjoyable. Elizabeth Banks - the horned-up bookstore clerk in ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and soon to be Laura Bush in Oliver Stone's ""W"" - has the smallest key role as Emily, but she handles it serviceably. Although she seems to be slumming here, Rachel Weisz (""The Constant Gardener"") effortlessly brings her confident allure to Summer.But it's Isla Fisher - the clingy bridesmaid in ""Wedding Crashers"" - who walks away with the picture in a smart, sexy and often touching performance as April. Hers is the most developed character of the three women, and she takes full advantage. Breslin is relegated to a plot device as Maya, but she manages to overcome the bratty nature of her character. In a case of petty larceny in a youthful pool, a ham-fisted Kevin Kline steals his few scenes as Roth. The 2008 DVD offers several extras with Brooks and Reynolds offering a sometimes quite amusing commentary track. There are a couple of shorts - a disposable fluff piece called ""Creating a Romance"" and a much funnier featurette, ""The Changing Times of Definitely, Maybe"" that discusses fads and trends in the 1990's. There are also a handful of deleted scenes worth watching once to fill in a bit more context for the characters.","Definitely, Maybe"

Start out with unrequited love, and this is the important part...Add the all important ""book subplot"". For me, evidence seems to point out that if the movie has this then ""it works for me"". O.K., I really have always thought ""Serrendipity"" was great and practically to my embarrassment I'd watch ""The Notebook"" again even without my wife. I'm blaming it on ""the book thing"".Seriously, forget comments like ""contrived"" and ""pure fluff"". I did not want to see all the bloody gore of a trampled heart, if one hasn't experienced enough of it in real life to give a reference then more power to you. What I did want to see is how life takes paths we are not always fully in charge of and how our own stubborn tunnel vision can trip up the journey more.

He has had three great loves in his life -- Summer, April and Emily -- and just for fun, he changes their names so his daughter has to guess which one he married, which is to say, her mom. As for his day to day life, he moves from some state most of us only ever fly over to New York City, to work on Bill Clinton's campaign. In more recent times, he has become a partner in a consultancy. The three women are all very appealing, and the kid is cute as a button. Also, good location photography. That's where the good news ends. The movie is dreadfully boring. Perhaps the director/writer wrote this from personal experience. If so, it doesn't change the fact that no one cares what happened to this guy during the 1990s, and has there ever been a more boring premise than an idealistic young man working on a political campaign? Reynolds is OK in a semi-dramatic role, but he often appears to be sleepwalking. Maybe that was intentional.

35,Matt_Layden,Surprisingly Good,7,20 July 2009,"I was surprised by this one and I enjoyed it. Ryan Reynolds can hold a film, yet he hasn't really seem to have found his niche yet. He's an upcoming star I want to keep my eye on and ditto to everyone else in this movie.Isla Fisher is cute and funny, she was my favourite of the three possible mothers in this film. Her story is also the most heartbreaking, I didn't tear up, but my girlfriend did. (She hates the fact that I never cry and calls me a robot).Elizabeth Banks is someone who has peaked my interest. I loved her small part in The 40 Year Old Virgin and thought she rocked the house in Slither. Her latest film Zac and Miri Make A Porno, she was not only beautiful, but hilariously funny. She is quickly becoming a favourite of mine. She doesn't have a heck of a lot here, but the little screen time she does have works.The last lovely lady is Rachel Weisz, who may seem like the odd one out. She was my least favourite of the three, but that's not because I didn't like her. I thought she was great here, it's just that I had a better connection with the other two. When we first she see, she is with Kevin Kline, who plays an alcoholic writer.The story is told in the present by Reynolds to his daughter. We jump into the past, via the story, and we the audience have to guess who the mother is, just like the daughter. There are no real clues because we have no idea what relationship the mother has with the daughter, all we know is that it is ending in a divorce. She figures it out and appears to be happy, I have no idea why because the way he told the story, it makes no sense for her to be happy as to who the mother is. Oh well.There is no real indication of what year it is, other then his job. Which was campaigning for Clinton as president. Which means everything looks exactly the same. I don't know why, but that part bugged me a bit.","Definitely, Maybe"
36,pc95,Better than Average,7,17 January 2011,"I liked ""Deinitely, Maybe"" for several different reasons. Most of all they thankfully mixed up the general plot-line in a fresh and mysterious way from your usual single-focused relationship driven romantic comedy. The movie does well to focus more on romantic drama than comedy. I liked the bit of realism injected into the screen-play which depicts better how dating and romances are fairly complicated and never drawn to plan. In this way, I liked how Reynold's character is thrust into different situations in which he cant find stability. The women characters in his life are all different and interesting. Only drawbacks with it are that the movie seems to mix things up for too long, and in general Reynolds is not too convincing as a supposed father. Anyway, still above average surely and somewhat recommended.","Definitely, Maybe"
37,intelearts,A little of How I Met Your Mother would have helped....,5,9 June 2008,"This is not as charming, life affirming, or as romantic as you would wish it to be. It is a nice nostalgic film with a pretty good script that has its moments but for me the problem lay with shaking off the slacker Ryan Reynolds and accepting the serious, romantic Ryan Reynolds and somehow my brain never quite got there and this makes it all a little irritating.He suffers from the Ben Affleck syndrome - trying to break away from a career built on slightly offensive characters into one of romantic comedies - Man About Town, Jersey Girl - is tough.The film is watchable, though editing is severely lax in places - it could easily have been 20 minutes shorter without skipping a beat - the performances are all nicely done, but nothing out of the ordinary.Honestly, it's an OK effort and worth viewing - but we just found it all instantly forgettable - and it needs a lot more LIFE to make this highly viewable. Abigail Breslin is outstanding and lights up the screen in every scene she's in, Ryan Reynolds not so much - and there is the problem, as he's on screen for 111 minutes - some nice moments - and it's heart is definitely in the right place - but ultimately frustrating to see a man who cannot shake his past as easily as he and we would wish...","Definitely, Maybe"
38,MartianOctocretr5,"A ""Romantic mystery"" that surprisingly works well",7,18 February 2008,"A 30-something in the middle of a divorce tells his daughter the story of his courtship with her mom. Since he had three significant relationships, he intertwines the stories of all three, challenging his daughter in sort of a ""solve the mystery"" game to identify which is her mother. Odd premise, but it sets up a good framework for a story which works.Setting such a ""sowing wild oats"" story against a backdrop of Clinton's romantic presidency escapades is inspired. Drawing parallels, and later contrasts, between this character who slowly changes and recognizes his foolishness against Billy, who doesn't, is both humorous and plot-enhancing. Most of what the story tells works well, although there are a few weak moments. The precocious daughter is an old cliché, and her actions at the end of the flick are not realistic; however, the talented Abigail Breslin more than compensates, and makes her character not only real, but likable. There is one subplot involving one of the ""possible mom's,"" which is left dangling awkwardly. It was as subtle as a sore thumb, obviously posed for the conclusion, which exposes too early how things would end up for the parties involved.Overall, though, a well-crafted story, which glides quite nicely through its many flashbacks. The entire cast perform well, making this movie's stretches of reality seem somehow believable. A better than average romantic comedy.","Definitely, Maybe"
39,wisewebwoman,Trailer is better than the movie,6,7 March 2008,"***very minor spoilers, there isn't any plot to spoil***The child in my life and I went to this movie based on the very good trailer we saw. We both really liked Abigail Breslin in the comedy ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and figured this to be in the same brilliant mode. WRONG.There are some great turns in the movie - Kevin Kline for one as an egocentric author/professor, Rachel Weisz for another as the woman in love with him and Isla Fisher as terminally eccentric April.And some really great music, I was thrilled to hear ""Everyday People"" by Sly and the Family Stone at the beginning.However, the middle of the movie - and here the 'middle' would be the hour where plot twist and turns should happen - is soggy and empty and flat. An awful yawning chasm of no script and unattractive posturings by the lead, Ryan Reynolds, playing Will, in his endless skirt-chasing schemes. That is when he's not loading what looks like far too much toilet paper into the Clinton Campaign Headquarters washroom, or hustling up tables for a fund-raising event, or stapling stuff.The father-daughter relationship is quite icky at times and heads into truly unbelievable territory when the daughter supports a relationship that is not the one with her own mother. All she wants, you see, in true Hollow-wood fashion is Daddy's happiness. How truly disturbing: foretelling many, many years on the psychiatrist's couch.However, in its favour, there is no graphic sex at all. The so-called shock value comes with the child uttering words like penis and thrusting. Ick again.A nice bit about Jane Eyre, it could have been explored a little bit more.The child gave it 6 out of 10 and I've left it at that. Mine would be a 4.Forgettable.","Definitely, Maybe"
40,Sirus_the_Virus,Only liked it because of Ryan Reynolds.,7,2 August 2009,"I only really like Definitely, Maybe because of Ryan Reynolds. I liked the other people in the cast but Ryan Reynolds was the best. I like Elizebeth Banks, Isla Fisher and others, but Ryan Reynolds is one of my favorite actors. Like Hugh Grant, i'm willing to see anything he is in. If it's The Amityville horror remake or X-men Origins: Wolverine, I will definitely see it. He is the reason why I gave Definitely, Maybe a chance. I didn't exactly love the film. I found some of it uninteresting and I thought the ending was very predictable. Even a baby could've predicted it(Depends if the baby knew what was going on. Even so, it could've figured it out very easily). I still liked the film for a couple of reasons. It really goes deep into Will's(Ryan Reynold) past. It goes in depth through every relationship. It doesn't go too much into the relationship with Rachael Weiz's relationship. Thogh the film isn't as good as other romantic comedies, it's not a bad film.","Definitely, Maybe"
41,RNMorton,Another light romantic comedy,8,1 February 2017,"Reynolds is a political consultant, the set up to this is that he is in the process of being divorced and he tells his daughter a story. In the story he is involved, to some degree or other, with three different girls. He changes the names of the girls so his daughter can't tell and then runs her through his love life over several years. Daughter has to guess which one he ended up with (along with us in the audience). The premise is kind of cute if a tad implausible (you would think daughter would be able to pick out her mom from the facts), but as it is this is more light comedy than drama and the wrap up is satisfying, if again a tad implausible. I'm usually there for Rachel Weisz but she didn't do too much for me in this one, while Isla Fisher did just fine.","Definitely, Maybe"
42,napierslogs,Maybe the 'Best romantic comedy since Annie Hall',8,10 July 2010,"""Definitely, Maybe"" was marketed with the line ""Best romantic comedy since Annie Hall."" At first I was appalled because it must be a lie, and how dare they put it in the same sentence as Woody Allen. But as I struggled to find many examples of what could be the best, I relented my negativities towards this film.It is just your standard romantic comedy but with a few differences to set it apart. Instead of just one, we have three main relationship stories being told. And they set it all to the rise and fall of Bill Clinton's presidency. A fitting and very refreshing political addition.Ryan Reynolds, as handsome and funny as ever, tells us and his 11 year-old daughter about his three past relationships. They spend way too long building up these relationships because the course they take is pretty obvious from the get-go, but at least he ends up with the right girl.I view ""Definitely, Maybe"" as just a collection of some very funny scenes. As Reynolds picks up his daughter after school and she tells him about the sex ed class they just had, it's impossible not to laugh at the confused and crude Abigail Breslin. It may be wrong to have kids saying some of the things they did, but it's hilarious.The filmmakers seem to view it as more ground-breaking than it really is, but ""Definitely, Maybe"" is still good and funny and maybe (only maybe) the best romantic comedy since ""Annie Hall""(1977).","Definitely, Maybe"

True I'm also a sucker for cute father/daughter relationships (maybe someday I'll have one like that) so it adds a little something for me personally. But all in all it is sweet, corny, entertaining, and funny in equal parts, which makes it perfect in my book!","Definitely, Maybe"
45,jaredmobarak,"I make a livingDefinitely, Maybe",8,15 February 2008,"Maybe I was just in the mood for a romantic comedy with some intelligence, but as far as wondering if I liked this week's Valentine's release, I saydefinitely. Wow, I just did that. Despite the horrible wordplay, I really found myself fall into this story of one man's three loves told to his daughter in order to show the complexities of that, humanity's greatest passion. Definitely, Maybe is very much your run-of-the-mill rom-com, yet something about it just resonated with me. It might be the three beautiful and talented actresses involved, the always fantastic Ryan Reynolds, the precociousness of Abigail Breslin (who goes a tad Dakota Fanning here, but great anyways), or the tale that, although somewhat obvious and clichéd, seemed true to the heart. Every performance added in the realism of this fact and the stages of our lead's life and the highs and lows of love just made sense. Paint-by-numbers? Possibly. Evenso, the colors used could not have been chosen more perfectly.I generally hold Love Actually on the loftiest position of great ""chick flicks"" and its perch is not to be questioned here. To me there are many kinds of romantic fluff out there, some that bridge genres and some that stick to the formula, with a few surpassing it. A film like Beautiful Girls is a favorite of mine, but the fact that it is about guys and their friendships shining light on the relationships they have, I can't put it in the same category as this film. Definitely, Maybe holds nothing back and never attempts to hide what it is. The equation has been written down and a story has been formed, filling in all the blanks. Boy meets girl, boy and girl separate, boy meets other girl, boy realizes true feelings for the lost lovestir and repeat, (in this case a few times). I guess one could say the gimmick of telling his travels to his young daughter so that she can guess which is her mother adds enough originality to keep it fresh for me. I'll admit that although I would have pegged the correct woman from the start, there were many times that I almost had to change my mind. Some credit for that goes to the writing, but again, as I said earlier, the film is filled to the brim with coincidence, dumb luck, and big clichés. As a result, I must give the bulk of the kudos to the stellar acting on hand.Ryan Reynolds carries the movie throughout, never letting go to show us that this was a paycheck film. Thinking back to work like Waiting makes me remember the smug comic look that he uses so often, the one that screams acting and performance, throwing any semblance of realism out the window. Could it be the fact that he plays opposite a young girl, two great actresses, and a third finally showing some skills beyond her pretty face? I'd agree with that. Let's not shortchange the guy, however, because his comedic timing is impeccable. Whether the quick-witted funny lines were scripted or ad-libbed in the moment, it doesn't matter. The fact that I couldn't tell shows me how lost I was in the proceedings that I didn't try to notice which was in fact the truth. Perfect casting and for being on screen pretty much the entire duration, I must applaud his work.As for the women, each brings exactly what is needed to their stereotypical roles. Rachel Weisz is used to playing the gorgeous, successful woman with a brain and the ability to use that mind with her looks to get whatever she wants. Here is no different. Elizabeth Banks is great, albeit in a smaller role than the others. Not quite on caliber with her performance in the wonderful Heights, but enough so to warrant her getting more quality roles (Kevin Smith picked a good one for his upcoming film). As for Isla Fisher, this may be the first time I can say that she was truly great. Yeah, she was a blast in Wedding Crashers, but her poor showing in The Lookout made me worry that there just wasn't anything there. With her role as April, though, she shows what she is made of. From the early scenes, smoking on her birthday, to the ones where emotions run very high, Fisher doesn't miss a single step. If the writing can be credited for anything concerning these three girls and their bond to Reynolds, it is the fact that writer/director Adam Brooks shows how strong it is, despite their transgressions. Each relationship begins and ends with only the coupling and passion lost, their love for each other never diminished. This is how I see life, maybe it's naïve of me to think so, but a connection that strong cannot be severed just because you are no longer together. That kind of love is too strong and thank you to Brooks for not being afraid to put that in the story, rather than go the easy route and have him hate the two losers showing us all who the mother is tactlessly.Yes, the journey is one that I had immense pleasure taking. We are shown a fully fleshed out Reynolds as he grows from the big dreaming college graduate to the weathered by life man he knew he would become. Or as the best character of the film might say, ""from boy-man to real man."" Kevin Kline is absolutely brilliant, stealing each and every scene he is ineven when just a photo. Derek Luke and Kevin Corrigan also deserve mention for small parts that still deliver important story necessities (Luke) and good comedy (Corrigan). All in all a very solid rom-com that I would say to all my male friends in a relationshiptake her to see it. You may surprise her by the choice, but know you may actually like it as well, despite its genre's shortcomings.","Definitely, Maybe"
46,Stampsfightclub,"There is no maybe about it, a definite watch",9,24 June 2008,"Finally, a romantic comedy that breaks the boundaries of clichéd romantic flicks and has enjoyable characters, a plot that is exciting, mysterious and funny and with plenty of twists to justify the genre that is often slated for it's predictability.Ryan Reynolds (Just Friends) stars as Will Hayes, a middle aged man who is coming close to a divorce and when his daughter asks about her mother, Will takes a look back at the past years of his life.Don't judge the film by the trailer because there is so much more on offer. Though the trailer for the film would give a sense of predictability and humour, the film was a delightful surprise with its great precise dialogue and dramatic scenarios, giving an account of true realism, of real life and its complications with married people, and couples.The plot is consistent with excellent twists and turns as Will dives deep into his relationship past, and there is always that great creativity about who it could be.Unlike a lot of other rom-coms, this 2008 film actually invites the audience into it, trying to make them guess and wonder who Will may end up with, and who the mother of Mai could be, which makes the film very unique and rather not the same old ""Will he get it together with her?"" There are a few clichés there, but still it maintains a more realistic drama approach to differ it which made me enjoy it.There are a few great one liners and a few chucklesome moments, not as funny as other romantic comedies, but that isn't the point of this film. The point was trying to maintain a realistic approach of relationships, which it did spot on.There is great acting from all involved which goes brilliantly with the direction and settings used by director Brooks.Other issues which were intriguing were the political side, with the election of Bill Clinton, and the views of all the characters in regards to him, which give the film different layers and points to consider.","Definitely, Maybe"
47,jon.h.ochiai,"Absolutely ""Definitely, Maybe""",9,17 February 2008,"The intriguing premise in ""Definitely, Maybe"" surrounds Ryan Reynolds's Will Hayes recounting the story to his 11 year-old daughter Maya (Abigail Breslin) about how he met her Mom. Will's divorce is impending, and Maya wants to know how he and her Mom hooked up. The jaded Maya proclaims, ""I know that love is not a fairytale."" So Will tells the story of the three significant women he was involved, changing their names and some of the details. The catch: Maya has to determine who her Mom is. However, the underlying and life altering mystery is not who Will married, rather who was his true love. This unexpected twist is a touching surprise in Director and Writer Adam Brooks' ""Definitely, Maybe"". Amazingly ""Definitely, Maybe"" resonates of family, love, and the cost of selling out on being happy. Arguably some of Brooks' funny story threads are contrived, but ultimately it is about seeing and believing in the best in the people we love. In a heart felt moment Will tells Maya, ""I forgot to tell you the happy ending to the storyYou."" Beneath it all, ""Definitely, Maybe"" is about the things that really matter in life.As Will's story begins, it is 1992 and University of Wisconsin graduate Will is heading to New York to work at the Bill Clinton Campaign Headquarters. He leaves behind his loyal and loving college sweetheart Emily (beautiful and smart Elizabeth Banks). He promises Emily that they shall remain together. Emily gives Will a present for her college friend Summer Hartley, who now lives in New York City. Idealist Will is initially disillusioned by his role in the Clinton Campaignone of his duties is ""Toilet Paper Guy"". He meets ""Copier Girl"" April (sexy and spunky Isla Fisher) and it is annoyance at first sight. Okay, this is predictable. Meanwhile, Will discovers that Emily's gift for Summer is a diary. This provides Will shocking insight into the apparently demure Emily. Will delivers the diary to Summer, whom is living with her thesis adviser, the egomaniac author Hampton Roth (hilarious Kevin Kline). Summer, an aspiring journalist, is brilliant and gorgeous, and immediately smolders for Will.Adam Brooks provides brilliant context here. At the time of the Clinton Campaign in 1992 there was rekindled excitement and idealism with the promise of change. This too, mirrors Will's life and loves. Following the victorious campaign and Presidency, this idealism too begins to tarnish reflected in the scandals of the Clinton Presidency. Relationships flourish and perish, and it is really no one's fault: Life just happens. There is an amazing scene where drunk Will confesses to April (Fisher), ""I really like you"" That profoundly wounds Aprilnot what she yearned to hear.Ryan Reynolds is great. Reynolds is charming, handsome, and funny. What really works in ""Definitely, Maybe"" is his vulnerability and humanity. Reynolds is just a good and decent guy-- who Will really is. His natural chemistry with Abigail Breslin, who plays his daughter Maya, is the heart and soul of the movie. Breslin brings a fresh authenticity and awareness to the precocious Maya. In another great scene her Maya tells Will, ""I just want you to be happy"" The three women in Will's life are all very strong. Elizabeth Banks as Emily has a wonderful spirit and grace. Rachel Weisz as Summer embodies a touching vulnerability under her cynical smarts. Isla Fisher is the amazing vaporous spirit, who possesses a pure soul.""Definitely, Maybe"" is not entirely what you would expect. Rightit is contrived and somewhat predictable. However, it has an authenticity for relationships and family. Mostly ""Definitely, Maybe"" is about finding true love. From that perspective, we can all applaud ""Definitely, Maybe"".","Definitely, Maybe"

49,Danusha_Goska,"Surprisingly Smart, Warm, and Poignant; Keeps the Viewer Guessing",8,2 March 2008,"""Definitely, Maybe"" is a surprisingly funny, sweet, smart romantic comedy. It's well worth seeing.We're living through the Dark Ages of the romantic comedy; recent representatives of the form have been sloppy, predictable, and witless. The sex is cheap; the jokes are gross-out, borrowed from teen boy flicks. Romantic comedies should never interbreed with teen boy flicks; the results are horrific mutant films no one wants to watch.""Definitely, Maybe,"" compared to this batch, is a model of swan-like sophistication. Ryan Reynolds, who plays the lead, Will Hayes, is not breathtakingly handsome and has no previous experience as the lead of a major romantic film. But he works, surprisingly well. His deadpan is crisp and cold. What tenderness and vulnerability his character feels is underplayed. Reynolds approach, of keeping his emotional cards close to his chest, works wonderfully. I hope Reynolds takes more such parts and perfects them. Given Reynolds' height and his suavity and his charm, I've got to compare him to Cary Grant. Okay, that's a stretch. There will never be another Cary Grant. But with the right direction, Ryan Reynolds could display similar control, wit, and romance.Abigail Breslin, all of 12 years old and already an Academy Award nominee, is perfect  adorable, convincingly innocent, curious, and caring  as Will's daughter Maya, whose questions prompt Will to tell her how he met her mother, whom he is currently divorcing. The trick is that Will won't reveal which of the women he'd almost married until the end of the story.The story unfolds in flashbacks. Will was a political operative for Bill Clinton. In addition to falling in, and out of, love with women, Will reports on the enthusiasm, and subsequent disenchantment, political junkies can feel for a charismatic candidate whose flaws inevitably become obvious (Obama worshipers, please take note.) Elizabeth Banks is Emily, a sunny, wholesome blonde, and Will's hometown sweetheart. The brilliant and spectacularly beautiful Rachel Weisz is Summer, a complicated, ambitious journalist who is fixated on Professor Hampton Roth, played by a shockingly old looking Kevin Kline. Kline / Roth is creepily convincing as an egomaniacal, pompous goat who sleeps with his young students.Isla Fisher is April, a Bohemian redhead who lives in bad neighborhoods, travels the world, and flickers in and out of Will's life. April and Will meet memorably. Will is purchasing a conventional brand of cigarettes. April is buying a ""natural"" brand. They critique each other's choices: her brand, he chides her, is much more expensive. She tells him that her brand smokes more slowly. He bets her twenty bucks that that is not the case. They step outside, light up, and pace each other's inhales. Yes, cigarettes are gross and they guarantee a miserable death for millions, but you can't deny that that is a great scene, almost as good as Jerry and Charlotte in ""Now Voyager."" April invites Will home. Her bookshelf is stacked with one copy after another of Charlotte Bronte's ""Jane Eyre."" She has been seeking the edition with wood cuts by Fritz Eichenberg. Her reasons for wanting that edition are especially poignant.Emily, Summer, and April are all desirable women, and they are also all flawed. The film doesn't make it easy on viewers by giving any of the women Will might have married an obvious advantage or disadvantage. Most fascinating are the changes in Will as he lives with each woman. With Emily, he seems most the most basic, traditional, homebody. With Summer, he can channel his inner ambition and professional drive. With April, he seems to touch an inner idiosyncratic core he never touches with either of the others. He could probably have found some kind of happiness with any of the three women; it would just have been a different happiness.""Definitely, Maybe"" inevitably inspires a viewer who has had more than one relationship to reflect on what was, and what might have been, and the twists of fate that brought us to the moment we inhabit now.As good as it is, I can't give it a ten, because the direction is a bit haphazard, and the production values are good but not great.","Definitely, Maybe"

The film was portrayed very cleverly, that it feels realistic, but also extremely entertaining to watch.

52,the-movie-guy,A romantic comedy that travels down the road of life,8,13 February 2008,"(Synopsis) Will Hayes (Ryan Reynolds) has just received divorce papers from his wife to sign at his advertising office in New York City. He picks up his 11-year-old daughter, Maya (Abigail Breslin) at school where she has just been taught sex education. Will can't take these new sex questions that Maya is asking him. So when she asks him to tell the story about how he met her mother, and how they really fell in love, Will thought this would be easier to explain to her. Will decides to tell Maya a bedtime story in the form of a puzzle with the names changed so she must figure out which of the three loves of his life became his wife and her mother. His story begins in 1992 when Will moves to New York City from Madison, Wisconsin, to work on the Clinton presidential campaign. He must leave behind his first love Emily (Elizabeth Banks) who is his college sweetheart. In New York, he meets his second love, April (Isla Fisher) at the campaign office. His third love is Summer (Rachel Weisz) a journalist who writes for the 'New Yorker' magazine. Maya begins to understand that love is not so simple, but she is able to put all the pieces of his three love stories together and solves the puzzle.(My Comment) The movie is a romantic comedy that travels down the road that Will Hayes took in finding his future wife through a series of flashbacks that explored the trials and tribulations of his three love stories. The story is fairly predicable in the relationships these women have with Will. Some of the plot is silly, but it is also heart warming and fun. There is a story within a story. Did Will choose the right woman to marry? Abigail Breslin was very charming and adorable in the character that she played. The interaction between Ryan Reynolds and Breslin as father and daughter is sweet and authentic. Some funny scenes are so true to life that you will laugh. The main story shows that some people in a love relationship miss, until it is too late, the everlasting importance of their choices. The show may not be truly realistic with the proverbial happy ending, but I actually enjoyed the whole movie. (Universal Pictures, Run Time 1:51, Rated PG-13) (8/10)","Definitely, Maybe"

Toss in Kevin Kline and a great RomCom writer in Adam Brooks ('French Kiss' and 'Wimbledon') and it's a sure thing. And it did work.The story is as charming as it gets.

Actually, it is. . . but it's not a bad thing. It goes beyond cutesy, though, and turns out to be often hilarious.

57,Brooklynsmagicmike,For a Rom-Com I thought it be alot funnier. But its a great romance movie nevertheless.,8,8 August 2020,I'm a big Ryan Reynolds fan and I watch almost everything hes in. For some odd reason this movie slipped through the cracks on me and I never got the chance to see it till today.I honestly liked this movie alot more then I thought I would. It is throughly engaging and keeps you entertained throughout. The pacing is pretty good and it doesn't ever feel like its dragging at all. Also keeps you on your toes and makes you really get into guessing who he ends up with. The acting was excellently done by all actors as well.The only reason I can't give this movie a 10 had to do with in my opinion the comedy. Sure there were some jokes throughout I had nice cackle at. But it wasn't laugh out loud funny nor up to normal humor Ryan Reynolds has in his films.This is definitely good watch either way. Whether it be by yourself or siginificant other.

58,srdjan_veljkovic,"Somewhat nice&cute romcom, starts well, then drops the ball",6,18 November 2017,"A guy tells his daughter the story of ""How I Met Your Mother"", similar to Ted Mosby of HIMYM fame, in that The Mother is not ""in the picture"" any more and he ends up with another woman, whom he has loved for years, way before the daughter was born. There are differences, The Mother didn't die, they're just divorced and the woman he gets together with at the end is not quite like Robin Scherbatsky, as they were never actually a couple and were miles apart most of time. Also, the girl is pre-teen, unlike Mosby's teenagers, and The Dad is younger than Ted Mosby.But, it's the same general story, the same general ""vibe"" if you will, but compacted into one ""long episode"" (~6 HIMYM episodes). Humor is slightly different, but, again, similar.It actually starts very well, then slows down and is not funny or all that interesting by the end. It's pretty obvious who's The Mother and who's ""The One"" way before the ""big reveal"".

59,tributarystu,Works Well!,7,12 February 2008,"You watch a trailer and you think ""this the kind of movie I could really sink my heart into"". The kind of trailer ""Definitely, Maybe"" had, most likely. And then when you're proved right about it, it only makes you feel better! While I had read that it was ""accused"" of trying too much to be Love Actually/About a Boy, I think this remark misses the point, which is that all three are fundamentally feel-good movies and that supersedes any such feeling of similarity - which, to my mind, is surely there, but does not harm the experience whatsoever.""Definitely, Maybe"" is about a dad (Will) who is getting divorced, his young daughter (Maya) and three of the girls Will had cared about in the past (code-named Summer, April and Emily). After a class in sexual education peaks her interest, Maya (Abigail Breslin) wants to find out the good old story of how ""mom and dad got together"", only that she expects the long, sentimentally hard-core version of the tale. Will (Ryan Reynolds) code-names his ""characters"" and delves deep into his past which somehow manages to revolve around the Clinton campaign of 1992. And so the story is actually one of three stories which are neatly interwoven and, unsurprisingly, end in the present tense.The rom-com works, firstly and foremost, because of the well suited, highly likable cast (as was the case with Love Actually and About a Boy) and their sweet take on a pretty conventional story. While Breslin is very much her old self from Little Miss Sunshine and Reynolds fits perfectly as the sympathetic father, it is in the three distinctly particular female characters and their relationships with Will that the story really succeeds. Isla Fisher (April), Rachel Weisz (Summer) and Elizabeth Banks (Emily) were ideally cast, not only because they are so likable (which really is the key word in ""Definitely, Maybe""), but because they also know how to go about their characters. Beside these one must note Kevin Kline's appearance as political writer Hampton Roth, who is a lot like the proverbial icing on the cake.Plotwise though, the film is rather uninventive, especially in terms of structure. The story is there, it works, but there are just these nagging moments which made me at least think that it tries too hard. But I did feel that ""Definitely, Maybe"" accepted its nature and therefore becomes so easy to accept and like: it never (or rarely) overemphasizes the obvious and it knows that everyone knows what the story is about.While I'm not really sure how and whether the pretty large emphasis on the persona of Bill Clinton politicizes this film, I don't even want to go into it, because it's really of little relevance. I for one wouldn't see a romantic comedy as a propagandistic tool, but given the current elections, it's perhaps the timing that might make it a tad controversial.Beyond this though, Definitely, Maybe delivers what it promises in a two hour film which didn't seem that long at all. A fun watch!","Definitely, Maybe"
60,jackgdemoss,Brilliant casting all across the board,8,15 May 2019,"Rom-coms typically struggle to get me invested in the story and the characters, but by the end of Definitely, Maybe I was getting pissed/thrilled at our protagonists moves because I so desperately wanted a particular outcome. The story telling method is a charming way to integrate the past and the present and allows for a satisfying conclusion. A must watch for any rom-com fans.","Definitely, Maybe"
61,novagirl11,loved the mystery in romcom despite frustrating ending,7,25 March 2019,"Although this movie was not particularly memorable the first time I watched it, I did enjoy the unique aspect of mystery in the romantic comedy. Upon the second viewing, I appreciated it much more. The ending was a bit frustrating, (without giving anything away...) and drawn out unnecessarily for dramatic effect, but then again, I guess that is not uncommon for this genre.","Definitely, Maybe"
62,seawalker,Does not follow the bog standard romantic comedy template,7,27 February 2008,"Romantic comedies are easy.1. Boy meets Girl. 2. Girl hates Boy. 3. Boy pursues Girl. 4. Girl hates Boy even more. 5. Boy gives up chasing Girl and meets New Girl. 6. Girl realises that she loves Boy. 7. Boy and Girl are unhappy. 8. New Girl leaves Boy for Boy's Best Friend/Brother/Father. 9. Boy and Girl kiss. 10. Roll credits and retire to Beverly Hills with up and coming starlet.I could do that!""Definitely, Maybe"" does not really follow the bog standard romantic comedy template (which is good!), mainly because it is constructed as a mystery.Soon to be divorced, mid 30's, single father Ryan Reynolds tells his 11 year old daughter the story of the three main romantic relationships of his life. One of these women will turn out to be his daughter's absent mother. Who will it be?1. Nice, hometown girl Elizabeth Banks. 2. Kooky, wild child Isla Fisher. 3. Ambitious journalist Rachel Weisz.Place your bets now! (I got it wrong, by the way. We'll skip past that, if I may.)Despite myself I rather liked ""Definitely, Maybe"". Nice unsentimental performances by the whole cast and a good script that delved into off-centre subjects for a romantic comedy, such as hero worship and what can happen when your heroes let you down. ""Definitely, Maybe"" is also quite funny, but with a dark centre. I thought Ryan Reynolds, who is on screen throughout, was really good. With this film and ""The Nines"" I am increasingly impressed with him. Really I am.If I had to make one criticism it would be that ""Definitely, Maybe"" is a little bit too long. If only 10 minutes had been shaved off the running time, the alternative ending would have been completely different, poetic, melancholy and more true.Oh, well... Maybe the producers didn't want that? Maybe the producers wanted the traditional romantic comedy happy ending, after all?Doesn't everybody.","Definitely, Maybe"
63,Spaceygirl,"Maybe boring, definitely horrible!",1,18 August 2008,"Awful, awful, awful!!!! NOT my choice, I have to stress. I don't DO rom-coms, and now I know why. With a thoroughly unlikeable main character and weak and clichéd female leads, ""Definitely, maybe' sucks! The only high point of this turkey is Kevin Kline. I think Mr Kline thought he was in another movie altogether! He shines in all his scenes, which are few and far between. Isla Fisher and Rachel Weisz struggle vainly with their pathetic characters and bad lines but with sparse characterisation one is unable to empathise with either of them. Ryan Reynolds is incapable of putting in any kind of performance. Yes, he's pretty, but hello! He CANNOT act!!!!!!! His character is so unlikeable, I'm surprised he managed to pull ANY kind of girl, let alone the quality women who seemed to fall for him. The script is laughably predictable and Miss Breslin, though good, is also clichéd and the ending is pure shmaltz. Please Hollywood, stop insulting us with this tripe.","Definitely, Maybe"

The plot seems OK but the acting of Ryan Reynolds really bored me, not improving much from his last career breakthrough he keeps acting monotone. What a surprise is Isla Fisher's acting is decent and quite into the character and may be she was the one who gives life to this forgettable movie. Even the daughter couldn't save this movie not because of the setting or anything just because Ryan couldn't get out from his already best-acting way, it just like seeing ""the proposal"", ""van wilder"". and even ""in the laws"". Wish they changed the main actor from the first place so this movie could be safe by then.","Definitely, Maybe"
65,Ozzy2000,Abouit idiot women,7,5 July 2008,"Will Hayes (Ryan Reynolds of ""Just Friends"") finishes signing the divorce papers from his wife Emily (played by Elizabeth Banks of ""Invincible""). He then picks up his 11 year old daughter Maya Hayes (played by Abigail Breslin of ""Signs"") from school where she has just has sex education classes. When Will puts Maya to bed and she continues to ask explicit questions about Sex so Will decides to divert her attention to how he met and fell in love with her mother Emily but instead he makes it a game where he tells of two other girlfriends that he was dating at the same time and he changes all their names so Maya has to guess which one turns out to be her mother. One of the girl friends is April (played by Isla Fisher ) and the other is Summer Hartley (played by Rachel Weisz of ""The Mummy""). Emily is the most marketable attractive and Will's first true love but he leaves her to join Clinton's Presidential campaign in New York. In the campaign office he meets the Slutty Bimbo April obsessed with British literature in particular Jane Eyer's ""Charlotte Bronte"" or even more stupid old books that were once gifts with the message on the blurb. Will finds out that Emily has affairs whilst they are apart and also meets one of the partners being Summer Hartley who is by far the sexiest and she sweeps Will of his feet. Will and Summer fall deeply in love and April remains Will's slutty and lose friend who works at the office. Eventually Summer , who is a journalist, finds some real dirt on one of the candidates fro which is now a main campaigner and quite unrealistically publishes it immediately without consulting Will knowing full well it will destroy his political career. By now Maya is totally confused as it would appear none of them are worthy however she does guess that Emily is her real mother. Maya then insists that her father pursue slutty and ugly April maybe because she really understands sex or Definitely because this is really a very but entertaining film.","Definitely, Maybe"
66,Dragoneyed363,Perfect casting is what makes this movie wonderful,8,1 July 2008,"I was completely astonished the first time I saw the movie, Definitely, Maybe. It truly was, as my summary suggests, absolutely wonderful, and that has mostly to do with the performances by the casts' dedication, though the plot and execution of the entire film was remarkable, as well, and the whole atmosphere and the way the movie folds out is incredible.It was so touching and completely entertaining from beginning to end, while being humorous and overall fun at the same time. The acting was great, as I have said, and the script was great, because of everyone who worked on the films' professionalism and believability. They did a perfect job on this movie, and I thought they couldn't have done better with what they had to work with. There was some material I found a bit iffy, and at one point I felt as if I was losing interest, just a little, but this movie is so uplifting that I couldn't manage to look away, and it kept being miraculously beautiful and enchanting that I couldn't help but be so interested. It deserves any positivity it receives, and I hope that many more people will watch it, because it is an excellent movie, that needs to be spread around for it's wonderfulness. Go see it if you haven't!","Definitely, Maybe"

68,nturner,"A Believable Tale with a Big, Big Heart",9,7 November 2008,"This turned out to be a surprisingly good little romance with touches of humor. I must admit that I wasn't expecting much when I sat down to watch this film, but it turned out to be a total viewing pleasure for me. One of the reasons for my low expectations is that I had just watched Chaos Theory in which Ryan Reynolds plays the role of a family man whose life is turned upside down. In fact both films start the same why in which an older, wiser Ryan tells the story in a series of flashbacks. From there on, they couldn't be farther apart. Whereas Chaos Theory is a mess of hysteric scenes and overacting, Definitely, Maybe is a believable tale with a big, big heart.The film begins with Will Hayes (Reynolds) contemplating his divorce papers saying to himself that he never expected to be at such a place in his life. Not only is he getting a divorce, he is a successful advertising man - a career path he never intended for himself. The great joy in his current life is the time he gets to spend with his daughter, Maya.There is a very humorous scene early in the film when Will goes to pick up Maya at school for an overnight visit. It seems the children have been given an introductory sex education lesson and there appears to be chaos and disorder caused by the first realizations of the facts of life. That evening, Maya, who is no slouch in the brains and maturity department, wants to know the story of her parents' romance and marriage. Will decides to tell her the story of the three women in his life that had influenced him the most, but he does not disclose to Maya or the audience which is Maya's mother.Using this premise, we are treated to a look at the life and romances of an interesting and very likable man. The tale starts with Will leaving his college sweetheart to go to New York City and work for the Clinton campaign in 1990. As the story progresses, we see Will maturing and changing from an idealistic young man to a somewhat wearied and discouraged citizen of the Clinton era. Along the way, he develops relationships with three extraordinary women - one of whom would become his wife and Maya's mother.I have read several reviews that do not praise Ryan Reynolds for his portrayal of Will, but I disagree. Reynolds is a suitable actor, and this part of Will might have been designed for him. He shows us the wide-eyed innocence of a young man first delving into the mire of politics and is then able to show that same young man matured and much wiser of the world. His performance is very good.Maya is played by Abigail Breslin who at a tender age is an excellent actress. Maya's character is extremely precocious and asks some very adult questions for her age, but she is still a little girl at heart. Breslin give the viewer a perfect Maya. I wonder if she will continue to be the consummate actress into her adulthood. Hers is definitely a career to follow.I've stated in previous reviews that I am a sap for tenderhearted movies such as Definitely, Maybe, so I may be biased in giving it five stars, but five stars it is. If you, also, enjoy a film with a heart, give this one a watch.","Definitely, Maybe"
69,SivakumarBalachandran,Definitely a feel good film..May be an enjoyable one for all...,8,29 April 2011,If you think this would be a usual romantic comedies then the answer is a no. This movie is about a dad who explains his daughter who has just finished her sex ed class about his love life with three beautiful woman. He starts the story as a mystery where the daughter has to find her mother among the three...With this line I don't want to talk about the story watch the rest..Coming to the casting part of the movie three love interests of Ryan Reynolds where so good in their roles particularly Isla was outstanding.Ryan has done justice to his role. The cute daughter was pretty good particularly you will enjoy her enthusiasm about raising questions to her father about sex.At last to conclude this movie is a feel good movie and can be compared with the film He's not just into you like this is a reverse version She is not just into you.I would give 8 on 10. great movie Enjoy.,"Definitely, Maybe"
70,robertallenandersonjr,Definitely a must see movie,9,9 April 2008,"I just saw this movie today and I loved it. I was the only teenage guy in the theatre also. The movie had a great message to it about always being happy. The little girl in this movie was also great she brought a lot to this movie, with out her this would not have been a good movie. The acting was good and the direction was especially good as well. I saw this with my dad today and it brought tears to his eyes. So this movie was also a tear jerker. For someone that loves romantic comedy movies I think would love this movie. It was a little slow moving but I kind of expected it to be. After it got near the end of the movie though it really got you thinking and wishing for him to end up with the girl he was meant to be with. It kind of also took little twists which were good as well. Ryan Reynolds did a terrific job in this movie playing a father who is going through a divorce. Then his daughter tries to help him find his true love. This movie was everything I hoped for so I think that you should definitely take someone to see this movie and have a great time.","Definitely, Maybe"
71,ansharora-12638,Better theatrical version of 'How I met your Mother',9,25 September 2020,"It is suffice to say that not only the storyline but also the ending seems to be the inspiration behind 'How I met your Mother'. When this movie came out HIMYM already had it's 3 seasons so we could say the movie took the storyline and the show took the ending. Not even ""took"", could be ""inspired"". I didn't get into research and all about it.The movie was cute and so beautifully cast. Every character worked so so well it just felt like something an average person would go through in life. The phases, the heartbreaks, the confusions and the missed opportunities. But, everything is bound to end happy and so does our life. Everything will happen what is meant to happen but our actions will decide how long it will take for that thing to happen.Isla Fischer is beautiful with tripple L. Elizabeth Banks and Rachel Weisz worked too well too. From the years of 2000-2014 were the years of Ryan Reynolds' 'acting phase'. Abigail Breslin was amazing in Little Miss Sunshine and she was amazing here too. Just what life is all about(relationship-y sense, not success or failure) and how some things are so near us but we take so much time to actually realize it, but till then the good thing is gone. Seize the opportunity as it gets multiplied then only.Cheers.","Definitely, Maybe"

74,lopcar1993,The best romantic comedy of the decade!!,10,3 June 2009,"This movie is a relatively stand alone romantic comedy.It doesn't follow the formula set up by other great and well know Rom Com's before it most, notably An Affair to Remember and Sleepless in Seattle. This film brings it's own sense of style, grace and beauty to a genre mired down by bad and very bland romantic Comedies, this film brings the genre out of the dark ages and gives it some great possibilities for the future.Definitely, Maybe was a good film for three reasons and three reasons only, 1.) It tells a story, a good story, and it sticks to it not trying to side step the plot that has already been set up. 2.) it brings together a great cast that also brings along there own charms and styles to this film. 3.) it showcase a warm and loving story that is so sweet and deeply rich with pain and love. All in all this movie showcases one of the most well made and well thought out romantic comedies I've had the pleasure of seeing in a long time.Ryan Reynolds(who shows some serious acting chops here.) just keeps on impressing me, from his comedies to his dramas, he's got it nailed as one of Hollywood's rising stars. He brings such subtlety and humbleness to his character. More than what the character actually needs. Rachel Weisz is beautiful as always and does exceedingly well in this and plays her charter out more than the rest and really stands out of the other two women. Elizabeth Banks was alright in this, the movie could have done without her character but her's was essential to the story, she doesn't make her character very believable or showcase any depth or real emotion at all. Banks was pretty much bland in this. Isla Fisher was alright. I'll give her a passing grade on the fact that she actually tried to put in some emotion. But she does fall short allot of the time and Reynolds has to pick up some of the slack. Abigail Breslin (who I love.) didn't really impress me much as Reynolds precocious and at sometimes annoying daughter, she did display some good emotional moments and she does good with what she's suppose to do. All in all the cast does hold up very well.This is one movie that I love to watch over and over and over and over again, just for the story none the less. It was a great story and a great movie and it deserves to be relished and adored for it's hip and cool vibe, it's sweet and kind nature and it's dedication to love and the hard times it can give us. None the less Definitely, Maybe is a love story that can't be ignored, or missed for that matter It's also a movie that will become a classic as time goes on, and it will go down as one of the best Romantic Comedies of all time. Non the less it's a refreshing and engaging film. Definitely, Maybe delivers.","Definitely, Maybe"
75,beregic,entertaining but a commercial sneaky propaganda in the end,4,23 June 2008,"entertaining-wise this has it moments but, for example(and there are many throwout), when the only person on this movie happens to be the only one doing her job ,she is called a ""b..h"" by a little girl.Abigail Breslin character (as Ryan Reynolds daughter) is really nicely done, very charming and well performed. but the dialogs she has at time seem to mature and not before long one realizes they are meant to influence viewers own perception on politics and social life in general...the screenwriter uses very, very sneaky inserts, that give the feature a too much ""pro-establisment"" spin. all the characters that represent something positive and not irrational are killed off. an effective preaching propaganda trying to reach to sentiment and hide its content within an ""innocent"" shell.it even promotes divorce as a FACT OF LIFE and not as of individualistic choices; ""individual"" which consumerism so much loves this days.and kids spin-off perspectives on divorce...GIVE ME A BREAK Mr. Brooks. even the love triangles are at best irrational. in a sentence; not true conservatism or neither liberal,but an advertisement within advertisement with hidden ""life"" implications. that is why i do not appreciate it. the political suggestions keep promote ""fence seating"" and anyone that HAS ANY political ideas or opinions, of any kind, is made out to feel as an idiot for having them in the first place...another attempt telling us we should just ""take it"" as it is...shameless propaganda.i felt deceived while watching it, over and over again. more yet, the whole script reflects a wealthy class perspective broken off from reality; it does not surprise me because in the end we are the ""suckers"" that they need to feed our minds with this ""synergy"" adds so they can stay as such or even prosper while everyone else gets confused on purpose and keep buying things they do not need or want something they did not wanted in the first place... i love comedies even well defined romantic ones ;i wanted to laugh but i could not because a LOT of aspects attacking subconscious in very submissive ways over and over again. there are no thought provoking arguments, just shallow situations trying hard to altercate reality with a clear commercial purpose.another issue: while i am a social smoker, i do not appreciate a bit the PRO-BIG TABACO commercial inserted within, that gives misleading information towards tobacco use and its present day PRICING(look closely at how the twists plays out to be a well defined commercial). looks like tobacco companies found new ways to advertise their product ... at the same time Ryan Reynolds lines on this topic try to play it ""safe""( the all typical aspects like it is a real crime or something) and bring ""political correctness"" into the feature.Mr Adam Brooks, this is the very last time i am watching your plays, i do not appreciate manipulations even if they are well done as a ""product""((while you are aware of such issues as mentioned above i found it entertaining. the actors play good, the visuals are great. but i am not buying it since i felt someone there(screenwriter) tries hard, over and over again, to play in my head ,not as ""entertaining"" but to ""adjust"" my perspectives as he sees fit... and in the end i am not buying the broken families arguments...","Definitely, Maybe"
76,ThatMonkey,"Definitely, Maybe is a possible, probably",9,26 February 2008,"After seeing titles such as Van Wilder, Harold and Kumar, Waiting and Blade Trinity, I pretty much had Ryan Reynolds pegged as a clown. Yes, he had comedic timing and the looks of a young Warren Beatty, but could he act. After seeing Smokin Aces, I thought what an over hyped, terrible piece of Hollywood legacy, but this Reynolds guy stood out among a cast of legitimate actors like J Piven, R Liotta, P Berg, A Garcia and B Afflleck.Today I was sold. Not only was this film the reason that some refer to movies as Cinema, Ryan has made the land of Maple proud by giving an Oscar worthy performance. Maybe I'm showing my age, or maybe it's just the fact that Isla has an amazing career that I already want to compare her to a young Bernadette Peters.This movie does an amazing job of doing exactly what movies are designed to do and that's tell a tale. Doesn't matter how real any of it is, if it's believable, the writer and director have done their jobs. Many movies introduce too many characters or make you hate the outcome of your favorites, but this tale is the perfect mix of love, sorrow and tragedy.If you are still reading this, you have read too much.

78,LaurieMann,Enjoyable Movie That Gets Some of The Details Wrong,7,23 February 2008,"I basically enjoyed Definitely, Maybe, with the always wonderful Abigail Breslin who coerces her father, in the process of being divorced by her mother, into telling her the story of how he met her mother. So, he tells her the story, changing the names and some details as he goes along.The movie does a good job recreating 1992 New York City and a somewhat befuddled young man William (Ryan Reynolds) who's temporarily left his college sweetheart Emily (Elizabeth Banks) back in Madison. William has gone to work for Bill Clinton's campaign. And, at this point, the movie failed my ""if you can't get the simple details right"" test.Here are my beefs: if you are sent from one state to another and put up in a hotel for weeks, you are not going to be ""toilet paper boy,"" you are going to be higher up in the organization. I can't imagine there being a $12 an hour copier-runner in a campaign now, much less in 1992. Those are both the sort of jobs the high school, college kids and interns get, who are there working for free. I know because I've had those kids of jobs on campaigns.And, campaigners not wearing their candidate's button almost constantly on their lapels? Let's be real! Now, some of the campaign stuff was spot on - the long hours, the chaos, the big open office, the ra-ra nature of the enterprise. And, certainly, later on, another campaign collapsing very rapidly amid bitterness and recriminations.In the course of working on the Clinton campaign, he meets April (Isla Fisher), who's an odd combination of flaky and charming. They have this very funny smoking scene which would, more typically, occur between two high school students but it works well anyway.Along the way, he also meets Summer (Rachel Weisz). There's a very amusing subplot about who else she is involved with, and it's a bit of a surprise.So, the question is, which one is his soon-to-be-ex-wife? The basic problem with this movie is, while there are times when William is shows to be quite competent and even charming, most of the time he's depressed and some of the time he's drunk on top of that. By the time he's telling this story to his daughter, he has more of his life back together, except for the fact his wife is splitting with him.But why? I think one of the real problems is, since more of the action of the story takes place 10-15 years in the past, there's a giant disconnect with the present. Yes, there are clues, but still...the fact that he's in the middle of a divorce, and it's clear his wife is doing the divorcing, leaves a funny void near the end of the movie.The other problem is that while Ryan Reynolds is a fine-looking actor, I wish someone with a little more depth had the lead. I wish the leading male had been as charismatic as the four leading females!","Definitely, Maybe"

83,dennis_chiu1,Probably The Best Romantic Comedy of 2008,10,3 March 2008,"""Definitely, Maybe"" from writer and director Adam Brooks is a wonderful surprise. The film is many things and each of them are very well done. At its core, it is the story of a thirty-something father trying to honestly explain to his daughter the complexity of love and life, triggered by questions from sex education at his daughter's school and the finalization of the divorce to his daughter's mother. Ryan Reynolds portrays Will Hays, the father, and Abigail Breslin (of ""Little Miss Sunshine"" fame) portrays the daughter, Maya Hays. Maya stubbornly asks her father to tell her the story of how Will Hays met Maya's mother and why things didn't work out. In a great twist to explain the divorce, he decides to tell her the story of three important loves in his life starting with his college sweetheart, a smart adventurous woman he met while working for the Clinton campaign in 1992 and a beautiful grad school journalist. Each of the women are portrayed as intelligent, real women, having complex relationships with Will Hays.Ryan Reynolds is a revelation in this film. He has frat boy, young political communications director, confused late twenty-something down, and thirty-something father down. His performance is pure, honest and convincing.Out of the many great romantic comedies I have seen in my life, ""Definitely, Maybe"" exists in a special category.","Definitely, Maybe"

All with the backdrop of the Clinton campaign and administration, no less !

85,lerkim,"A Somewhat short version of ""How I Met Your Mother"" done in romance all the way!",9,27 January 2011,"Once again I am here to give a review, and this time it is Definitely, Maybe, a movie that I in the beginning wasn't sure of, some of you may know I am not a huge Ryan Reynolds fan, but I got to be honest, with the movies that he has been in over the last years I have slowly began to grow fund of his acting, this is one of those movies, one that surprises me.It is in a way a hybrid of ""How I Met Your Mother"" yeah I know they don't have anything to do with each other, but the story in this movie is something like it, just one girl asking her father about it, and of course not an entire series, three women, who is the mother, three women who is his love really? Storyline 10/10 – The storyline is definitely the stuff that makes this movie flourishes, the story is simple in a way, and it is about a daughter who after having had sex class at an early age asks her father about how he met her mother, that's actually it.The thing that steals the movie is of course your own idea of who her mother is, in the movie the daughter is wondering, but you the viewer is as well are trying to find out in your mind who is the real mother and who is his real love, in the beginning of the movie we find out he is divorced.I am not going to ruin anything for you in this review, I will however say this watch the movie for the story, it may be a little simple but as the story goes on it gets complicated haha.Definitely, Maybe Is also a hidden message for you, that's all I am going to give you, a hidden message that you should keep in mind when watching it, because that will be the clue, I felt that was a really cool idea! Actors 9/10 – Some of the actors are hit and miss, but those that steal the show is surely the three women the daughter and yes of course Ryan Reynolds, and since I have already stated before I am not really a fan of him I will have to almost retract my opinion, because he is beginning to win me over with his acting.There is not that many actors in this movie, and most of them don't really have that much of an impact, those that does are those that I have already mentioned and they steal the story which is also the point of the movie, stay focused on them, I guarantee a new experience.Soundtrack 8/9 – I got to be frank I am not that fund of the same music in many movies, yes there were some great ones but those that you will remember will be ""Nirvana"" and Frank Sinatra, the other part of the soundtrack is made just for the soundtrack.And they are all played out well, some of them don't really have a big impact but they all try to set the mood of the movie and in some way they all do, I especially liked the music played in the ending of the movie, no not a song with voice and no not at the credits a little before, when you see this movie you will know what I am talking about.When I watch these movies I always try to listen to the music, some of them can be so ripping, some of them can be so wonderfully done, and much of the music done directly for this movie do set the mood and are ripping Special Effects N/A – Didn't really notice any, yes of course the obvious camera angels and other places where the camera might have been held or moved differently but they aren't really special effects or anything they are just to give the movie a different feel, so basically it really has no effects and if it does then I haven't seen it.Overall 9-10 – I can give this a big nine basically because of the complicated story done so simple, and the actors play their parts so well, the music is also a lot better then what I expected, I don't really look for reviews when watching a movie, I don't care, we all have different opinions on movies, some will like it some wont.You will just have to try it out, give it a try and just basically merge yourself into this simplistic story that can at sometimes feel so complicated, maybe you are wrong when you wonder who will be the woman who is the mother and maybe you are wrong in knowing who is the love of his life, but no matter what give it a try.This movie is much better than your average love flick; it challenges your preconceptions in a way, well thank you for reading another review done from me!","Definitely, Maybe"
86,dinhbeo,Interesting love movie!,7,12 June 2021,"I have to say that the plot is very interesting; the way it build up a story is excellent. It tells about a man who's going to divorce with his wife and tell his daughter all about his love story. Well, he might be one of the most unlucky man in the world finding love; but in the end he could find his happiness that he was looking for. But I still feel that the film should have scenes explaining why they decide to divorce; I kinda feel curious about it. Anyway, still a great film!","Definitely, Maybe"
87,houndtang75,Definitely,9,16 June 2008,"There is more rom than com in 'Definitely, Maybe' but Adam Brook's film is none the worse for that. It is one of those well-scripted, well-acted, highly professional films that Hollywood rarely makes these days and it is refreshing to see a romantic comedy than doesn't resort to slapstick and bawdy humour. Ryan Reynolds is effective in the lead, and the three (or four if you count his daughter) women in his life are all fine, with Isla Fisher being particularly good (you're rooting for her all the way). There are some genuinely touching moments here, especially towards the end. I look forward to seeing more from Adam Brooks.","Definitely, Maybe"
88,clg238,Phony and Unfunny,3,11 January 2008,"Even though we know Hollywood romance movies are far-fetched, this movie is so patently phony from the outset that it's painful to watch. It begins with 11-year-old Maya saying words such as penis and vagina (she says even more later), which lets us know that there's no depth to which this movie will not sink. She talks her father into telling her smarmy details about his past relationships, all of which are utterly boring. The father is divorcing Maya's mother, and Maya has totally improbable reactions to the situation. In all fairness, Abigail Breslin is adorable and the best actor in this sad pastiche of a movie. The New York street sign is phony; what is supposed to be a holiday party for politicos is preposterous, as is the idea of volunteers stapling together signs for a presidential race or a volunteer getting paid to be in charge of toilet paper one minute and then running advertising for a presidential campaign the next. There are so many good movies playing just now--go see something else.","Definitely, Maybe"
89,sackjigler,great flick,8,16 February 2008,"There are very few romantic comedies that can enter that clichéd world and come out unscathed, but this film somehow holds its head above the rest by giving you something most of these don't, a true sense of reality. The story is simple, a daughter wants her father to tell her how he met her mother, but he chooses a different approach. Instead, he gives her three different scenarios for her to figure which one is her real mother. The chemistry through the film with all the characters is very genuine and that truly helps the film gel. Ryan Reynolds was wonderful and tries to stay away from the stereotypical one liner spewing lead. Rachel Weisz, Isla Fisher, and Elizabeth Banks are also terrific as the women in his life. Also set around a real life situation which adds to the believability. The movie isn't flawless but it is a step above any other romantic comedy in the past few years. It's not overly sappy and has a satisfying and real conclusion. It is a date movie but I don't think the guys will be to terribly offended by what they are shown. I didn't believe that I would enjoy it as much as I did, but it really surprised me, and I am glad I decided to give it a shot, and I think you should to.","Definitely, Maybe"
90,angelshalz,"definitely, maybe???",5,18 July 2008,"To be very honest, I was intrigued to watch this movie because of its' makers. Not because I checked out the plot or the reviews and thought it would be an entertaining movie. I mean, all of the other movies made by the same guys were hits, even though I saw only one of them so what could possibly make me not like this one? Well, I was sort of wrong. After watching this movie, I realized that it was not my type. It revolves around a man, Will Hayes (Ryan Reynolds) who is in the middle of divorcing his wife. His daughter, Maya (Abigail Breslin), who apparently has no idea who her mother is, plays a ""love mystery"" game with her father, who delivers a tale about three love affairs he's had. And out of the three women, she has to guess which one is her mother. The tone of this movie is slow, a bit funny at times, and a bit confusing (I think that was meant to be). To me, Will seemed to be equally interested in all the three women and a bit too wry (I think that was meant to be too). Anyways, I can't set a ground statement upon which you can decide whether you'll like this movie or not , but I do positively feel that college students and adults would like it more than preteens or teens.","Definitely, Maybe"
91,RikerDonegal,Great storytelling makes otherwise ordinary rom-com something special.,9,21 March 2008,"When his ten-year-old daughter starts asking awkward questions about his impending divorce - and his life before she was born - a thirtysomething Manhattan dad sits her down and tells her the story of his three great loves. He changes the names to keep the surprise of who he eventually married, and he spins a charming story - spanning fifteen years - of loves lost and found and lost again.And found again.Ryan Reynolds (one of my all-time favourite performers) has seldom been better, Abigail Breslin (who appears frequently to comment on the story being told) is as genuinely charming as ever, and all three girlfriends are wonderfully cast. The story moves along at brisk pace and it's easy to see why the hero would fall in love with each in turn (at various stages in his life). What's not as easy to see is which one he will eventually marry. And, as well as successfully concealing the identity of the mother, the film makes you wonder many times how it will all end. Yes, it's a romantic comedy, so you're conditioned to expect a happy ending, but this isn't your typical romantic comedy so you're expecting a non-typical ending.And you're right.The ending is just as clever as the rest of the movie and it makes for a great story overall. It's a very modern story. I think it would have been called ""a sophisticated sex comedy"" in bygone days. Which just means the characters are a bit more mature and closer to real life than you normally find in this genre.What could have been an enjoyable B-grade rom-com is lifted up by unconventional storytelling and a little extra effort spent to get the ending just right. Grade ""A"" from me.http://yetanotherfilmreviewblog.blogspot.com/","Definitely, Maybe"
92,Happy_Evil_Dude,"Enjoyable, but predictable and disappointing",7,15 July 2008,"I was looking forward to this movie. The trailer was promising, the cast was solid (with Rachel Weisz being one of my favorite actresses) and this seemed like it could be a very enjoyable romantic comedy. Unfortunately it ended up being just an average romantic comedy. I know, I gave the movie a 7/10. But that's my ""enjoyable, well-made but not really much special"" grade. This is a by-the-numbers romantic flick, 100% cliché and 100% predictable. Those who love love love romantic comedies will probably really enjoy it, and those who hate them will despise this. As for the others, who can appreciate a film regardless of its genre, this will probably appear as a lackluster effort, watchable and competent but lacking the charm and sweetness it takes to elevate films of this genre. The performances are generally good with the notable exception of America's new favorite Abigail Breslin. She's as annoying here as she was endearing in 2007's No Reservations. All-in-all, while this isn't a must-see it isn't a must-skip either. Don't be afraid to watch it, but don't expect much out of it as this is unfortunately one of the poorer romantic comedies made in 2008 so far, with What Happens In Vegas, Forgetting Sarah Marshall and especially 27 Dresses all being much superior in terms of enjoyability and making you all warm and happy at the end.","Definitely, Maybe"
93,usersince03,OK film,6,30 June 2008,"I bought this on DVD the other day, it was OK but it could of been better. The film is about Maya (Abigail Breslin) guessing who her Mother could be. I did find the scene where Maya asking her Dad about her conception a little disturbing and the scene where she talks about private parts. I do wonder how Abigail Breslin's family felt about her saying those lines. April's (Isla Fisher) voice was irritating but I thought she was a good character. Summer (Rachel Weiss) was an OK character. I didn't get why Emily (Elizabeth Banks) who turned out to be Maya's mother was in her daughters life and I didn't know why she left her daughter with her father. I wasn't impressed with the deleted scenes on the DVD.","Definitely, Maybe"
94,fbustamp,"God, this movie was so bad",1,12 July 2019,"Even my wife fell asleep. And this is a chick movie. Really unbelievable script. Really like the actors, tough, nothing to criticise here about them, but the script was so bad....","Definitely, Maybe"
95,natw,Sweet chick flick give us romance through a guy's eyes,7,30 April 2009,"Director Adam Brooks offers a chick flick with an interesting twist. A young girl badgers her soon-to-be-divorced father into telling how he and her mother met. After finally relenting, he agrees to tell the story. But he also adds other tidbits, including relationships with other women, and he tells her he will change the names. That way, she - and the viewers - won't know who the mother is until the story comes to an end. It's a refreshing twist on the genre, with the male describing his romantic interludes rather than the female, and it works on a number of levels. Actually, the plot reminded me of the screen version of the musical ""Momma Mia,"" in which Meryl Streep's engaged daughter invites her mother's lovers to her wedding in a plot to determine which is her father. Of course, in this movie, young Abigail Breslin knows who her mother is, but she doesn't know which character in Dad's story is her. The dad (Ryan Reynolds) spins an interesting tale in which three love interests are weaved in and out of his life. Will the girl's mother be his high school sweetheart, Emily? Or will it be the kinky but substantive Summer? Or maybe cute, quirky April? Or maybe another side character in the story? We are left to wonder. More importantly, we are genuinely interested. The ending is satisfying without being contrived. Guys, if you have to see a chick flick (and who doesn't?) this year, you could do a lot worse than this one.","Definitely, Maybe"
96,dareent-amethyst,Definitely entertaining,9,5 October 2014,"Definitely my kind of chick flick. Definitely, maybe is probably one of the best movies to keep you company on rainy days and lonely nights. This romantic comedy keeps you intrigued and guessing from the very first second. The way the plot was delivered is beautiful! I liked the story line, i loved the characters although i hate Emily haha, i loved almost every single thing about this movie. It's funny and cute and romantic. There is one thing i don't love though, and it is the opening plot. I found the plot where the obviously not old enough kids were taught about sex inappropriate. Especially because Maya keeps saying penis and vagina and sex. I don't find it funny and i doubt it would make any difference if the entire introductory scene had been cut out from the movie. Definitely, maybe tells the story of how a man who's in the middle of a divorce and whose romantic relationships have always been a mess, figured out who his true love is while telling his daughter the story of how he met his going to be ex wife. I highly recommend this movie!","Definitely, Maybe"
97,dallas_viewer,"No maybe about it, this is definitely a stinker",2,29 July 2008,"Let me qualify that. If you loved 27 Dresses or Dan in Real Life, you'll like this movie. It has the same contrived feel, the same ""no one would ever say this stuff in real life"" dialog, the same chemistry-free pairings. Within 10 minutes of watching this mess, I was bored and annoyed.The acting was horrible--though kudos to Isla Fisher for giving it her all under the circumstances, I loved that ""Marisa Tomei"" kind of quality she had--but how can you really ""ding"" actors when the scripts they are given are so lame? Reynolds--who I suspect couldn't act his way out of a paper bag, let alone this pile of pooh--admittedly had dialog that no man should have to say. Note to writers of ""romantic comedies"": Men are not women. Most of them do not talk like women. We do not want to hear them talking like women. (Also, were RR's eyebrows shaped? Because that was just a bit too ""metrosexual"" for my taste.)Even Abigail Breslin, the little girl, pretty much phoned it in. There was a scene where she flops onto her tummy in bed, pouting, and suddenly she kicks her feet a bit--not in a natural ""I'm having a tantrum"" way, but more like she was thinking, ""Oh, wait, it would be a good touch if I kicked my feet here."" There is no character development in the movie. Everyone is extremely superficial, annoyingly so. Some events make no sense. (Why did Will get fired for one faux pas in an industry riddled with scandal? And just what all happened, job-wise, between ""then"" and ""now""?)Timing is deliberately kept fuzzy. It's hard to tell how much time has passed. (For example, Will looks about the same to me at the start of Clinton's campaign as he does at the end of the film.) If you can find a scintilla of originality in this movie, let me know. For example, we get the usual ""I want to see your face first thing when I wake up in the morning and last thing at night"" spiel at one point. Then we get the done-to-death scene where the female friend tells male protagonist (who's about to propose to another woman) to practice proposing on *her* first, and as he gets to the ""I love you"" part, his voice trickles off and they stare into each other's eyes for just a moment. And you just know where this is all going... Why do I torture myself with this dreck?","Definitely, Maybe"
98,Xjayhawker,Love is a long and winding road..,10,8 February 2013,"Will (Ryan Reynolds) is a young idealist who wants to make a difference in the world.Very noble idea.But life and circumstances surprise us all,each and every one of us. Life never turns out how we expect it to. Love happens or doesn't. We meet people we like and one thing leads to another..we believe we're in love and sometimes we love the wrong one. That's life. That's true. What we have is a father relating a story to his daughter according to how he remembers it. He makes decisions along the way and meets three very different women in his life who may or may not be the one he married, the mother of his daughter. The story-telling occurs while Mom and Dad are divorcing, hence the daughter's inquisitiveness about how they met. The three women behind the question mark are Emily (Elizabeth Banks),April (Isla Fisher), and Summer (Rachel Weisz)..All three weave in and out of each other's lives..timing and chemistry come together and disappear like a puff of easterly breeze. The movie is excellent at depicting real stories most of us have lived through. Anyone who thought Ryan Reynolds could only do Van Wilder will be amazed at his acting range. And anyone who thought Rachel Weisz was steady as a rock in the Mummy will see a solid performance. Isla Fisher easy on the eyes in Wedding Crashers? She is a sheer delight as a rebel who comes of age showing hidden emotion in every screen shot she's in. Solid movie easy to like and it grows on you ..Highly recommended.","Definitely, Maybe"
99,melinetto,genuinely sincere,6,7 May 2021,"I do usually enjoy a Ryan Reynolds movie. And this movie is just one of the cutest and heartfelt one that he's in. Plus, you know, Rachel Weisz, Elizabeth Banks and Isla Fisher are co-starring with him and of course with it, that makes an appealing rom-com.I like the chemistry between the dad (Ryan Reynolds) and his daughter (Abigail Breslin) throughout the film. That's a fine duo. I think that Abigail Breslin is really an important character and a key element for the story even though it doesn't seem like it. She shapes the story with all of her questions and comments.It's a romantic-comedy film but not like with all the clichés and if you like the genre, i think you'll like and enjoy this one.","Definitely, Maybe"
100,The-Kissable-Writer,Couldn't help myself from loving it.,8,7 February 2009,"Yes, it's dangerously close to sappy and yes, it's fairly predictable but in a way you want it to be. From an artistic point of view it'd be great if after ninety minutes he suddenly gets hit by a bus or less dramatic if he just stayed alone and relatively happy. In some ways the bittersweet ending would've been more classy but for the sake of the warm fuzziness it'd be a disaster. 'Definitely, Maybe' will never be a great work of art simply because of the room for improvement still is too large. I bumping into these sort of scripts over and over again, why didn't the writers go that extra mile? A darn shame, it's not like you have to rewrite half a script to make it much better, just some minor imperfections needed to be worked out (well, some big ones too but I'll keep it positive).'Definitely, Maybe' is a romantic comedy about Will Hayes (Ryan Reynolds) and how he fell in love. It all starts when the ambitious fresh out of college Will decides to move to the Big Apple causing him and long time girlfriend 'Emily' ( Elizabeth Banks) to drift apart, leading them to a painful and inevitable moment where 'Emily' drops the bombshell that she cheated on him and wants to 'set him free for his own good' (quote), all this shortly after Will's wedding proposal. (It's getting wonderfully complicated already isn't it?) At that moment, Will realizes that life is not the happy fun roller-coaster ride he thought it'd be and that his search for true love may never find a happy ending. We follow him through the highs and lows of his relationships with 3 different women, as he narrates the story to his ten year old daughter. Every time when Will meets one his big loves, he's sure it's the ever enduring love great novels were made of, but destiny may have something else in store for him. Love throws more than a few curve-balls and it seems our cheerful fairytale may not get a happy ending... As you probably already figured out, the story is told in retrospect, which opens up a wide array of possibilities for the scriptwriters. Big time leaps become easy to insert, romanticizing of details is allowed - seeing that we are told a memory, not a fact - and the fact alone that the narrative is so unusual makes the story all the more intriguing and exciting for the audience. Not all of those possibilities are used as effectively or fully as they could've been. Just make the comparison with the TV-show with an almost identical premise namely How I Met Your Mother. One of the things that makes that show in question the highest quality comedy sitcom of the moment, is the cleverness put into the writing. In that show, the main character Ted tells his kids the story of how he met their mother, the audience gets to guess which one the mother will be. Of course, we get sidetracked in other unrelated events concerning the other characters, but still the main theme remains Ted's quest for love. To give you an example of the creative use of the narrative perspective, there's an episode where - seeing that Ted can't give a bad example for his kids - he keeps saying 'fudge' instead of the actual f-word and 'gringe' instead of...well that's kept up to the audience's imagination :-). Other examples include him telling one thing, meanwhile we get to see the exact opposite thing, this concerns almost always sexual - and thus inappropriate - events. I can go on and on but I don't want you to think I'm writing a promo for the show, I just want to show you how the writing could've been improved for comedy's sake or romance sake all the same, which was were the emphasis was in this film.I'm a guy, in case you didn't know, and not a big fan of romantic comedies are all. They're usually - I'm gonna lose big points for this in the typical reader's opinion of me - excruciatingly bad. They give an unrealistic image of contemporary men and never give a man's point of view, plus I'm always having trouble locating the alleged comedy bits :-). But as James Rocchi beautifully observes, 'Definitely, Maybe' has an edge on almost all others in it's genre: 'where most modern romantic comedies are obsessed with the champagne fizz of chance introductions and initial attraction, Definitely, Maybe sticks around to see what happens when the bubbles burst. Every romantic comedy has the 'meet cute' where boy first connects with girl; Definitely, Maybe has the 'meet cute,' but it also has all the things that can come after -- the awkward moments, the scary possibility of hope, the comforts of sadness, the tough talks, the ugly partings, the hard-won reconciliations.' Amen.I do like 'The Notebook', seeing that if you see the best of the best of any genre, it's enjoyable for anyone and I did like In The Mood For Love, High Fidelity and a couple of others. 'Definitely, Maybe' gets added to that list, and that's a huge compliment. In the end, I just couldn't help myself from loving it.","Definitely, Maybe"
101,brendon-kenny,Definitely NOT a Liam Gallagher biopic,7,19 May 2008,"This review was originally published within a Valentines Day special in the Doncaster Free Press, and also featured on BBC Radio Sheffield, Leeds and York - It's that time of the year when us men are expected to show how romantic we can be, tap into our sensitive side and splash out on roses, pack like cattle into an over-priced restaurant or head to the cinema to see a sloppy Rom-com that, at any other time of the year we'd avoid like a Suffragette's Ann Summers party. So what lovey-dovey slush are we likely to be subjected to this time round? On general release this week is a romantic comedy that looks set to feature on many a Valentines agenda, Definitely, Maybe. It has all the usual ingredients, a hunky lead for the missus to ogle (Ryan Reynolds), strong female performances for her to idolise (Rachel Weisz, Isla Fisher), an adorably cute kid to coo over (Abigail Breslin), and it's from the same stable that brought us the OTT sequel to Bridget Jones (2004), so you'd be forgiven for expecting the same old schmaltz that you've been forced to endure on countless other 'romantic' nights out with your other half. The good news is guys, that it's not half bad. Casting Reynolds is a masterstroke, as the former Van Wilder can handle slapstick and the obligatory sensitive stuff equally well. Whilst his character Will Hayes errs on the side of being a little too clean cut and wholesome he never appears anything other than genuine and as much as it may pain us to do so it's difficult not to empathise with the guy. On the eve of Will's divorce, his ten year old daughter Maya (Breslin) asks him how he first met her mother, hoping that the nostalgia will convince him to reconsider the break-up. The film's structure is based on Will recounting the story of the three women in his life, changing their names whilst Maya attempts to work out which one becomes 'Mum'. Following her heart-warming, show stealing performance in Little Miss Sunshine (2006), Abigail Breslin again proves herself to be incredibly naturalistic and lacking any of the grating precociousness that can often blight child stars.The flashbacks start 15 years previous as a young, naive Will graduates and leaves his blonde childhood sweetheart (Elizabeth Banks) to join the Clinton administration in New York. We are gradually introduced to Summer (Weisz), an intelligent, promiscuous brunette, and April (Fisher), a young, arty and free-spirited red head. So, there's plenty of eye candy for the boys, and the rapport that is quickly built up between Will and his love interests is witty and relatively low on cheese (with perhaps one glaring exception  that, whilst cringe-inducing is soon forgotten - if not forgiven). It's fortunate that the dialogue is handled so well, as the film never reaches first base in the sex stakes  it bravely steers clear of a reliance on the physical to add credence to the lover's bond where many movies would use this as a shortcut to construct relationship.We get a 3 for the price of 1 deal on the love stories, which keep things fresh and moving at a nippy pace. The only downside to this is that the actresses don't get quite as much screen time as they deserve. There are plenty of twists and turns, some slightly misguided proposals (Will may wear his heart on his sleeve but he's macho enough to refuse to get down on one knee!), and the overriding sensation is that this is very much a modern day take on romance. It's not a traditional, sweeping love story with one true Love; each relationship has its own pros and cons, ups and downs, and a certain degree of cynicism. That's not to say that Definitely Maybe abandons the traditional happy ending or other Rom-com conventions, it's just not as sugar-coated and rosy as we've come to expect of the genre. If your ideal Valentines date is sweet and endearing, with a good sense of humour, then overlook the occasional cheesy line and spend the night with Definitely, Maybe.","Definitely, Maybe"
102,wijajo-72563,A Rare Watchable RomCom (for people who don't like RomComs),7,23 July 2018,"When the film starts with facts about divorce rates, you know this won't be a typical romcom. I wasn't sure whether to rate this as a 7 or an 8.Pros:
Highlights that partner choice isn't simple.Highlights that not all romances end well.Good acting.Unusual premise.Keeps you guessing throughout the film.People who hate romcoms normally may not hate this film.Cons:
Little girl at beginning is precocious and unbelievable.Ending also unbelievable. Could have explored the topic more deeply. The main character's choices were partly due to events that happened to him and thus he rarely had to decide which qualities were most important in a partner.","Definitely, Maybe"
103,godzillandg,Good movie.,7,23 April 2008,"I heard about this movie almost a year before it came out. I'm a big Ryan Reynolds fan. I wondered if the movie would ever come out and then I heard it was going to be released on V-day. ""YES!"" I thought ""finally"". Then the girl I went to see the movie with was five minutes late so that meant that I missed the set up to the movie. But the movie was utterly enjoyable just the same.I like the idea of mysterious romantic comedy. Where we don't quite know who the mother is. But it is pretty clear who he wants to be with. And you know that's enough. The story was well crafted, the players were phenomenal, and the experience unforgettable. I really enjoyed this movie because, well, it's the guys point of view. All ""chick flicks"" are from the woman's point of view, it degrades the man in most cases except for ""the one"" that the girl is meant to be with but he does something to tick her off so therefore all men are scum. In this, yes we address the issue of men are scum, but we move into the unfamiliar territory of men and their emotions. We don't want women to know that we have a side like that but it is there just the same.Oh! Whoops! I loved the interplay between Ryan and his on-screen daughter. Where he would go off into something that he should be changing and then realizes it is much to late to go back, so he does what any normal parent would do. He lies. He lies his butt off to dig himself out of the hole he is burying himself in.The end of the movie is good to... but I won't go into that here. See the movie when you can. I think you'll enjoy it.","Definitely, Maybe"
104,jwvandegronden-1,"A great movie, great cast and lovely story telling without being soggy",9,14 November 2010,"I'm one of those few guys who actually enjoy chick flicks/romcoms, even prefer (!) this type of movie over most of the mindless shooting/fighting/ego boosting stuff. Although a good heist movie is not wasted on me, if possible, I will go for the romcom. Or to balance things out, rent two movies, one romcom and a Tarantino.I never really liked Ryan Reynolds, or more specifically the era he somehow represented for me, the youngster/pseudo/not-funny funny movies created for the intellectually numb. Anyway, I never watched any of his work other than scrambles of this ""American Pie""-niche only feeling strengthened in my opinion on both subject and actors.And than I watched this one... first I saw The proposal, and this movie, Definitely, Maybe. What a pleasure both were to watch! My opinion of mr. Reynolds turned 180 degrees after watching both movies. But Definitely Maybe is by far the most touching (not necessarily the best) romcom I have seen to date.I read some people talk about characters not being developed enough, but I disagree. Moreover, they are often vessels for something else: how do we interact with each other, sometimes emotions are enlarged or marginalized all in the interest of showing a certain growth path the writer/director wants us to participate in or reflect upon. And even if in the end the only thing they had in mind was the box-office, somehow I always take something with me from the movies I watch that strengthened me. Too generous? Maybe. Does it work for me? Definitely! So here I am, a guy who has had his fair share of relationships, broken off too many of them to feel comfortable with, went through a roller-coaster ride of more than a decade, and now watching, alone, for the umpth time this little gem and I couldn't keep it dry.Oversensitive maybe, but I find it a sweet sour experience which is cathartic to my soul. And of all the romcoms I have seen, definitely maybe does this best.Oh and BTW, the ear buds at the beginning? I found myself wondering too what those were, and the only thing I could find that more or less resembled the pieces he used, were the BT ear buds designed by Kleer...","Definitely, Maybe"
105,halohamish,Definitely watch,8,17 October 2008,"Usually leaning towards the weird and obscure world of art-house and thought-provoking film, romantic comedies are often wasted on me. But, when watching any film, I went into Definitely, Maybe with an open mind and, as a result, was rewarded with a charming, deep and complicated look on love. While the events that interweave with these relationships may seem a bit far-fetched, It's the portrayal of the love within these relationships that is so realistic. This mixed with genuine amounts of humor separates Definitely, Maybe from the rest of the films in this genre that are usually so generic.Set in present time, father Will Hayes (Ryan Reynolds) tells the story of the three women he loved in his life to his daughter, Maya Hayes (Abigail Breslin), while she tries to uncover which one of them is her mum. The rest of the film plays out in a 90's reminiscence narrated by Will, a certain theme that is quickly becoming common use in film. The portrayal of the 90's is reasonably accurate, although some anachronisms, like the fashion, still remain. But beside this, the authenticity and the feel of the 90's is definitely there.Most importantly though, what makes Definitely, Maybe the fresh breath of air in the romantic comedy genre is its characters. Ryan Reynolds is excellent as Will, supplying a funny, but so very real role. Along side him is Isla Fisher as one of his three lovers, April, who is absolutely gorgeous and a joy to watch. Abigail was quite charming in Little Miss Sunshine, but I feel over her cutesy factor now and her acting proved awkward in places in Definitely, Maybe. The script is also one of the best I've ever seen for this certain genre.All these positive factors provide a very fresh and funny film in the romantic comedy genre that even those not familiar, or inclined, to it will find much enjoyment.Hamish Kearvell A.K.A Screaming Japan Productions - www.myspace.com/screamingjapanproductions","Definitely, Maybe"
106,je-remy,Narcissism Paraded as Love,6,8 November 2015,"I enjoyed this movie but the explanation for why he kept the book at the end was totally lame. The only thing he had left of her... well, she's still living... she's still his friend... he can ring. He wouldn't have like a Christmas card she signed just for him? She would never have given him a present over all the years - despite arranging this big birthday party for him with everyone at it.This is the thing she's searching for for years. She's still searching for it while he's holding on to it. This is narcissism not love. This is an insensitive character who doesn't pick up on obvious signals - cause he's all about himself. He's even obnoxious when she tells him to get his act together - to help him.This movie is the kind of ""love"" that wants someone around cause they do it for you. And even then, they weren't at the top of the list. The caring for someone else's needs bit of a relationship isn't demonstrated on the male side.The searching for the book idea is interesting, but it collapses the whole movie at the end.","Definitely, Maybe"

A surprise for me, since i've known Ryan Reynolds from the Van Wilder's comedies and Blade last sequel; so i wasn't expecting much.Definitely.. is a well crafted romantic comedy about an adult man who remembers his past love life (and finally came to understand it) at the same time he's divorcing. And is by the hand of his young daughter (splendid in her role)telling her as a bedtime story, who would eventually be her mom (and the love of his life?). The interaction between Reynold's character and his daughter is for me one of the major highlights of the film. Realistic and not dramatic, it seems like a real father would talk to his child from the heart.The script develops gracefully and the twist on it feels completely believable, a major point in a story that deals with three different love relationships, many screenwriters could have screwed this up.All the cast performs well, the pace is just right (not a funny moment at the wrong time, and not an inadequate sad one either); so you can be sure you will be enjoying the film during and not only after.If you're not a romance buff, stay calm. This one tells you the story from the point of view of a regular guy, with all the classic mistakes we men could do, the work we hate, etc etc.Good movie, i look forward to see this director new ventures.","Definitely, Maybe"
110,dzlz105,Really stupid movie,1,3 September 2009,"Don't waste your time seeing this movie. Its plot is far-fetched - what 10-year-old wants to know the seamy story of her father's love life as he's in the midst of divorcing her mother? Does this writer know any children? The premise is slimy. The acting is embarrassingly awful. Everyone reprises roles they've done elsewhere, except for Kevin Kline. How did he end up in this movie? And, worst of all, this movie is too long. I noticed it was written by Albert Brooks. I have not enjoyed anything he's done since ""Broadcast News"" (I think that was the name -- it had an excellent Holly Hunter in it). Wait -- ""Mother"" also had a few good scenes. Anyway, Albert's creative days are over. He should have been put out to pasture years ago.","Definitely, Maybe"

112,jfmvp,A Surprisingly Watchable Chick Flick,9,31 March 2009,"Ladies, you know we gentlemen love to complain when you ask us to watch a chick flick. There's the moaning, the groaning, and ultimately, we give in. That's because we love you.But I wasn't groaning after watching ""Definitely, Maybe"" with my girlfriend. I think my list of truly watchable chick flicks is around ten or less, and I'm sure I've seen over 200 romantic comedies in my day. But ""Definitely, Maybe"" makes that exclusive list of ten, with others like ""Pretty Woman"" and ""Clueless"" -- sorry, I can't really think of any others offhand.What ""Definitely, Maybe"" is, is realistic about love. Love's not as perfectly defined and obvious as other chick flicks tend to make it seem. Love takes trial and error, it takes practice, and mistakes.That process is one we follow throughout this film. Ryan Reynolds is adequate in the leading role, though the standouts are Isla Fisher and Rachel Weisz, as two of Reynolds' three love interests. Elizabeth Banks is forgettable in her role, though I did enjoy her in ""Zack and Miri"" and ""Role Models."" Abagail Breslin is there, playing her typical cutesy daughter role. She's fine, though she tries awfully hard to live up to the expectation of cuteness. Nonetheless, she gets it done.But back to the plot...sure there are some clichés that pop up at different junctures in this two hour ""love"" story, but there aren't as many as you'd expect. Reynolds is forced to deal with true heartbreak, once in a traditional fashion, and the second time, not so traditional. Not at all, actually.On the negative side, the conclusion of ""Definitely, Maybe"" is predictable. If viewers are watching and listening closely, then they'll know who Reynolds ends up with long before the end credits roll.But fellas, we know we can't have it all when it comes to chick flicks. Most of the time we're just looking for hot actresses to keep us occupied in the movies of this genre, and we have them here with Fisher and Banks. Fisher is ridiculously hot.All in all, there's something authentic about ""Definitely, Maybe."" And, I must say, the score is OUTSTANDING. Really, the background and foreground musical choices are perfect. It helps the film linger a bit longer than it may have in the first place.Guys, if your women are asking you to choose between a bunch of chick flicks this weekend...lean in the direction of ""Definitely, Maybe."" You definitely will make it out of this one alive. And maybe this time around, with this particular chick flick, you won't want to smash a folding chair over your own head. Best of luck with that.","Definitely, Maybe"
113,Starlitelet,Don't feel the connection,6,13 January 2011,"Overall, I fairly enjoyed this movie. The storyline was above average compared to other chick flicks. The acting was average. I wouldn't have categorized this movie as a comedy because there wasn't anything funny. Perhaps, a few chuckles at a couple of phrases.Anyway, what bothered me was that they did not develop the ""Emily"" character enough. I did not know or I mean to say I still do not know how they reconciled for the second time and have a child together. There was no explanation. Also, their chemistry wasn't there for me. I didn't even understand why they were a couple at first anyway. Also, even though Emily slept with his roommate, he also kissed two other girls. I know that kissing and sleeping aren't equivalent, but they both cheated on each other. Also, he moved on from her quite quickly. In fact, he moved on from all the women quickly.The ending also left me skeptical because what are the chances that he'll end up happily ever after with April? After how all the other previous relationships went, I doubt it'll last long.Even though the ending was different, I felt like it would have been better if they actually stick to old school movies. Like if he went back to Emily. Then they could have been a happy family. It just felt odd that CONVENIENTLY April was available and still in love with him after 10 years or so. I didn't feel the connection.Nonetheless, I have no objections in Will returning to April in the end IF they Maya was April's daughter. Then it would have made more sense. I don't know why they added the twist for. It was unnecessary. Like for Will to marry ""Emily"" and have a child with her was not required. It would have actually been slightly better if it was even Summer's baby.","Definitely, Maybe"
114,Yellow_under_the_feet,Romantically Chick flick,5,3 August 2014,"Definitely, Maybe is a 2008 romantic comedy film directed by Adam Brooks, and starring Ryan Reynolds, Isla Fisher, Rachel Weisz, Elizabeth Banks, Abigail Breslin and Kevin Kline. IMDb gives it 7.2. According to Rotten Tomato it scored 72% A love triangle. Its about a good boy haunting for love. A political consultant tries to explain his impending divorce and past relationships to his 11- year-old daughter. And see what happen next. Ten-year-old Maya (Abigail Breslin) is heartbroken to see her parents splitting up, but she's determined to find out precisely how it was that mom and dad came together in the first place. When Maya starts questioning her father Will (Ryan Reynolds) about his life before marriage, dad's memories soon drift back to the time when, as a naïve Wisconsin native and aspiring politician hoping to work on the presidential election, he first arrived in New York City. As Will gradually became savvy to the ways of the big city, he gradually developed romantic relationships with three very different women: Emily (Elizabeth Banks) was the girl-next-door that he could always depend on, apolitical April (Isla Fisher) was the best friend and confidante who was always there to listen, and free-spirited journalist Summer (Rachel Weisz) was both beautiful and ambitious. In order to prevent his perceptive little girl from predicting the outcome before his story is told, Will carefully changes the names of his three romantic interests, creating a hopelessly romantic puzzle that highlights both the joys and hardships of true love. Dun forget to watch out Abigail Kathleen Breslin's acting (an American actress. She is one of the youngest actresses ever to be nominated for an Academy Award )","Definitely, Maybe"
115,dbacke1,This film went nowhere,4,2 March 2009,"I was really hoping for a lot from this movie, especially when I saw the cast credits. However, it was pretty much a waste of time. I tried watching it two nights in a row, and each time I fell asleep. I finally finished it on the third night, and I only finished it because I wanted to get my money's worth. This film really had no point to it at all, and it went in too many different directions. I didn't care about any of the characters or what happened to them. The cast was totally wasted, especially Abigail Breslin. I thought it was going to be a cute movie about a father and daughter, but it was totally boring and uninvolved, with too many flashback scenes. If one looks at the cover, they might be misled. A waste of time.","Definitely, Maybe"
116,clevelander,A better example of the genre,7,15 June 2011,"If you were looking for an evening in (or out) watching a romcom (and don't we all feel that that sometimes), choose this one above some of the more well known and popular examples. It's well-crafted and tries hard to avoid many of the well-known clichés. Plenty of twist and turns: sentimentality, yes, but not laid on with a table-knife rather than a trowel. Admittedly not quite Harry met Sally or Annie Hall, as, though competently acted, the characters are still romcom cyphers. But marvel at the script-writers' solid achievement of entertainment and engagement. Competent production values keep it rolling along to the last second, without padding. If it had just added those witty little touches of human observation that characterise a great movie it might have made it into my ""8"" rating, reserved for films that have something outstanding.","Definitely, Maybe"

119,mrstafty,By the numbers good time,8,21 March 2009,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I sat down with this. I'd been recently disappointed by a bunch of films that claimed to be romantic comedies and as this one unspooled it seemed to do so in a heap. It's the kind of film where you know that the main characters are going to end up together in the few minutes. You know their misunderstandings will get worked out. You even cheer for them because let's face it, we've all been there.Definitely, Maybe was a well done movie. The acting was top notch, it was a pleasure to look at and I had a good time from top to bottom. I don't say this about every film here, especially the romantic comedies.Having said all this good stuff, it would be deceptive of me to claim that Definitely, Maybe was without its problems. For starters the comedy was almost nonexistent. The dialog was also a bit ridiculous. Ever since Juno and Little Miss Sunshine, every child has started to speak like a college professor, with clever adult insights that don't occur to the emotionally stunted adults in these films. The movie was also very long for this kind of thing. They could have easily taken out several relationships and made the film better.If you're looking for an enjoyable date movie, this will do nicely.","Definitely, Maybe"

The two deliver Oscar worthy performances in hands-down the best romantic comedy I've seen.**WARNING! POSSIBILITY OF SPOILERS BELOW!** I do my best to write my reviews without any spoilers, but if you want to see the movie without a more descriptive plot outline than the back of the DVD case, please, do not read further.Ryan Reynolds plays William Hayes, an advertising executive and father to Maya Hayes. When Maya first learns about sexual education at school, and asks why one of her classmates is considered an 'accident', William is coerced into telling Maya the story of how he met her mother.They create sort of a game, in which William changes all the names of the women in his life around the time he met her mother, and Maya gets to play ""Guess Who's Your Mom!"" Beyond that, I refuse to give spoilers, however, I will say that the love interests of Reynolds are fantastic. Elizabeth Banks is wonderful as Emily, a bright star to add to the cast. Rachel Weisz brings yet another in a long line of brilliant and captivating performances and adds another notch to her proverbial acting belt, as Summer Hartley, and last, but certainly not least, Isla Fischer is captivating in her role as April Hoffman and delivers a tear-inducing performance.Yes, I admit it freely, this movie was very touching and I shed more than one tear over the heartrending and heartwarming experiences of William's trials and tribulations in finding love and happiness.This movie is rated a deserved 10/10.","Definitely, Maybe"

I knew that I did not care about Ryan Reynolds as a lead actor. His performance was bland. However, he looked the part  tall, approachable guy from Wisconsin. His lack of performance was quite compensated by 3 female leads and of course Abigail Breslin. All 3 women in his life were notable, likable, and mature. Special applause goes to Isla Fisher, who I thought was best thing in ""Wedding Crashers"". In ""Definitely, Maybe"".she brings such a sunshine that everything lights around her. Abigail Breslin purveys true genuine feelings of a pre-teen girl that is dealing with her parents divorce. The premise of a story is a bit unrealistic, but in order for the rather clever and true to life story to span, we have to forget the fact that a father would hardly discuss his love life with 9 years old. Story itself has several twists and turns which doesn't make it a cliché. I even felt some Woody Allen-esquire moments within the movie. Especially when the character of Rachel Weitz started to sing. It doesn't carry any meaning, but it's a nice moment. One of the many nice moments in this movie with a happy ending.","Definitely, Maybe"

Although, the narration slows at times and things get a little draggy. But its OK. The climax is just great and a really great happy ending. and thats my favorite part of a ROM com.Well. That's it.

It often happen with people going in and going out of relationships without knowing who they love actually... Sometimes the timing decides, sometimes the circumstances do it otherwise.The way movie has been presented is quite nice. It kept me guessing till the very end who was the girl's mother actually. But I was able to guess whom William Hayes (Ryan Reynolds) loved actually. It felt like it was my story, and believe me, you will feel like it as your story if you happen to watch it with a free mind.Performance wise I believe, Rachel Weisz gives the best performance from the actresses, but maybe it's because she plays the major role in the movie. Isla Fisher was fine, and actually I liked her character the most. Specially, when William Hayes (Ryan Reynolds) practices to propose his then girlfriend on her and she says, ""Definitely, Maybe..."" My rating, 9 out of 10, it's a good romantic movie that I think, most of the guys would like to watch, and many couples will enjoy...!

130,LIND77777-1,Were the writers on strike for this production?,6,19 March 2008,"I was very disappointed in this movie, although the acting seems competent. Do the screenwriters have any concept of how to write a movie? They seem to have taken a mishmash of gimmicks and called it a movie.Maybe their chief contribution is reversing the usual chick-flick formula, by having the man have the biggest role and be faced with the dilemma of choosing between several attractive mates. But the way the script is written just doesn't work.The premise is downright confusing and implausible. How can appealing 11-year-old Maya not know the basics about her mother? Has the mom done a ""Wakefield"" (disappeared and taken on a new identity somewhere else)? No, Maya lives with her five days of the week.The scriptwriters' approach seems to be to create a series of incidents involving the male lead and the various women, but they don't add up to much of anything. One of the women was the mother, but there is no compelling reason why any of them should be.Then we finally learn who the mother is. They are in the midst of a divorce, but there is no plausible reason for it. She's a perfectly nice woman and he seems a ditto man.Maya's reaction to seeing her dad soon afterward meet up with one of the other women is totally unbelievable; now, she's a matchmaker for her dad. A gagging ending.Finally, the movie doesn't really measure up to TV movie standards. The male lead is handsome, and we're rooting for him, but his lack of expression becomes really boring. But the real blame belongs on the scriptwriters. For this they want an increase in pay? I'm giving it a six, but that feels a little generous.","Definitely, Maybe"
131,shralper@hotmail.com,A divorced parent's fantasy,2,25 August 2008,"I saw this story as some sort of divorced parent's fantasy. If you could just sit your 9 year old daughter down for a couple hours and explain how ""complicated"" adult life and relationships are, surely she would understand why you and mommy divorced. This includes telling your daughter about sleeping with other women, boozing, smoking, etc. Of course, your child would suddenly understand and accept that daddy wants to put his penis in another woman other than mommy (note the first 10 minutes of the movie the little girl talks continuously about how a man ""thrusts his penis into a woman's vagina"", as she has just learned sex ed at school and can't stop talking about it. Funny? Not really). Not only would your daughter understand you, but she would INSIST that you hook back up with that hottie from your younger days and drag you to her house (instead of dreaming that you get back together with mommy so your family is intact).Yeah, right, dream on. Keep telling yourself that's what your daughter would do. And oh yeah, your little girl also won't have any problems hearing that her mom had a lesbian relationship with another one of your lays from your younger days, and slept with your roommate to boot. Naw...it's all good. She'll understand.Seriously, pass on this one. It's also heavily pro-Democrat, as the lead character spends the 90's working for Bill Clinton. At least at the end, even this shallow, self-absorbed character is disgusted at Slick Willie's inability to tell the truth, even though his loser friends about brag about how they would vote for him again in a heatbeat.And that's the ONLY reason I'm rating it a 2. It's the only redeeming message in this mess.","Definitely, Maybe"

This movie has a feel good quality and most of all I like the ending. I felt it was an original type of story especially how it is told. I wish Adam Brooks would write more of these. This one is up there with ""French Kiss"". The acting is very good and I was surprised at how much I liked Ryan Reynolds as I have seen him in other things I did not like him in.

134,s_b_n_s2,Good reminder movie for Election Year,1,22 August 2008,"I was simultaneously stunned and relieved while watching this movie. While, it's an ugly reminder of America's (and in particular, New York's) decline in morality. It's an open testament and reminder to the loose morals of the modern-day Democratic Party and its most ardent followers - which is a very good and timely reminder to Americans as we're going to have to choose our next President very soon.Much of the movie gravitates around Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign and how young supporters adulated and followed him in New York that year, particularly the character played by Ryan Reynolds. What is a bit amazing is how blunt and biased this movie is in its liberal political proclivities. It's so pro-Democrat that they even had old Bill Clinton himself run by towards the end of the film. And one of the movie's 'heroines' worked for the laughably liberal 'Amnesty International'. Republicans are made to look stupid, albeit subtly.But most importantly, especially in light of John Edwards' recent adultery scandal, this movie is an ironic reminder of how the Democrats will lead us nowhere nationally. Even the Ryan Reynolds character in this film got disillusioned by Clinton. George W. Bush is briefly lampooned at one point in this film but whatever his shortcomings, we didn't have to put up with a bunch of blatant moral failings like Clinton. If you're conservative, take note of how the liberals don't even care filling a poor little girl's head (played by Abigail Breslin) with a bunch of rubbish about messed up relationships. That struck me as bad taste.Go to this movie and come away prepared to vote for John McCain!","Definitely, Maybe"
135,sereneredhd,For Sentimentalists,7,29 July 2008,"I love Ryan Reynolds and Isla Fisher. They are both terrific actors. This romantic comedy, while you know its pretense if you've just seen the trailer, does have some typical sub-plots. But it's not all nice and tidy and contrived as some may think.What I love about this story is that it's told through a man's third person point of view. We know he's telling the story, but we see it as it happens from a third-person perspective.I've never seen Kevin Kline in a role like he plays in this movie, either, and I thought he was fantastic.If you're sentimental, traditional even in your expectations of romantic comedies, you'll love this movie just for its core message. In very general terms, that core message is that love conquers and withstands all.I read a review of this movie in ""Entertainment Weekly"" magazine and remember a comment about Ryan Reynolds, something about his performance not being all that great. I can't remember the exact wording. But actually, I like his performance in this movie. He's incredibly talented and has played comedic characters in the past. This time, I believe he had to perform the character as how the character would have been at that point in his life, which did not require a lot of ""outward"" emoting. As many men we all know, he plays the character from within, which means not much emotion on the outside, very restrained emotion.Even though the men in my life are more sensitive than most men, we all know that the majority of men, even those who are more sensitive than others, tend to internalize their emotions and true feelings.On the other hand...many times, there's nothing going on internally at all...other than the sound of crickets.=) Seriously, this is a role for ""under"" acting, if there is such a thing. I believe he hit the nail on the head of how many men in the world may actually be living their lives in similar situations.This movie is ultimately...sweet and worth watching, if for nothing more, the relationship this man has with his daughter. -s-","Definitely, Maybe"
136,stephenm-18,Seen worse. Seen a whole lot worse.,7,11 February 2008,"For some people, the romantic comedy genre is there to be sneered at. It's a lower art form subscribed to by the uneducated masses, the same plot regurgitated through a word processor with names, dates and locations changed: (""Girl meets boy, she's feisty, he's snobbish, they don't see eye to eye - How oh how are they ever going to end up together by the end of the movie?""). Admittedly, I'm not the biggest advocate of the ol' romcom, but this film falls into the ""watchable"" category of romantic comedy. Of course it's phoney and sugar-coated. Of course it has no resemblance to real life - For goodness' sake it's a romantic comedy! If it wasn't shallow and improbable it'd be called a ""drama""! I don't understand people who post comments on this site, taking potshots at films like this for being dumb and schmaltzy. Look at the poster before you go in. If it's got young people with good teeth on the poster, the title is a bit twee and the font is in pastel shades, chances are, it's a romantic comedy. If you don't like that kind of thing don't go in!Anyway, my girlfriend took me to see this film yesterday (missed Cloverfield) but it was OK. Seriously. It was OK.Ryan Reynolds is a solid enough lead, with enough comic talent to keep things ticking over. Abigail Breslin is charming too. Kevin Kline seems to growing gracefully into more senior roles, and Rachel Weisz, Elizabeth Banks and Isla Fisher are all comfortable enough as Reynold's love interests.The script isn't belly-laugh funny but it has it's moments, there's some good use of news footage from the time in which the story is set, and the plot ticks over nicely. There's also a bit of guessing for the audience too, and my bet is you'll stay to end if only to find out how it finishes.So there it is: a better than average romantic comedy. Not weighty. Not cerebral. Not challenging. Just a mildly diverting story, about a nice bunch of nice looking people having a nice time and getting their nice little lives sorted out. Nicely.To give this film the scathing it's had in some quarters, is like a food critic cruelly reviewing a bag of crisps. That is to say this film is not meant to be ""food for thought"" it's just a snack. And if you get your kicks out of inflating your own ego by raving about how much a dumb film like this offended your sensibilities, then ""for shame!"" is all I can say. You weren't led blindfolded into the cinema. You knew what you were getting into. It should have been obvious from the poster that this film is a romcom.Trust me, as a man that's been dragged to more than his fair share of romcoms, this one is by no means bad.","Definitely, Maybe"
137,rosti-4,Definitely Good,8,3 May 2008,"Guys, would you love it if you had three different pretty girls at your command? Well, Ryan Reynolds stars as Will Hayes who was in that situation and was in agony over it. Will is a divorcing man with a ten year old daughter, Maya, (Abigail Breslin) who questions how he met her mother. He answers, after some witty pleading, and his story takes off into a dramatic and comedic ride about a guy who is seriously confused. It starts out in the year 1992 with Will having high hopes in the wonderful field of politics. He temporarily leaves his girlfriend ""Emily"" (Elizabeth Banks) and goes to work in New York for the Clinton campaign. There he meets a wise cracking copy girl, April (Isla Fisher) and an aspiring (and slutty) journalist ""Summer"" (Rachel Weisz). There, the whole story takes off into one interesting mess.I'm just going to say it now, I loved the acting. There isn't a single performance in the movie that I can rip to shreds, it was all done elegantly. Well, maybe the daughter, but she's young and it's understandable. Instantly the characters were set in stone; you knew whether or not you liked a character or hated their rotten guts. I've never been a huge fan of Ryan Reynolds, because he never did anything that really made go ""Wow"". I didn't exactly get that, but he easily made me believe the character. Elizabeth Banks is a magnificent actress, and she outdid herself in this film. She was really likable at the beginning, and eased you into the film. When Isla Fisher was first introduced, the script wanted you to laugh and I can happily say I did. Rachel Weisz wanted to shock you a bit, she shocked me, and she did her character well. The script was witty, which I am a huge sucker for, but it's also written in a way where you sympathise for the characters, and makes you think about your own complicated mess and how ridiculously easy it should be to fix. It flowed easily and added elements in the best way possible. I couldn't ask for a better way to add ""I did not have sex with that woman!"" in a movie. Pure magic.I've tried to think of something hugely negative about the film, I just can't; it wouldn't be as terrific as it is now if anything was omitted. I wouldn't watch it with kids though, because the number of sexual references makes it a little uncomfortable. The rest of the movie made up for it. It is something I will watch again and again. I'd advise anyone who gets bored with romance to not watch it as it isn't for you, but if you like a good chick flick with intelligent humour, then watch it. You won't regret it.","Definitely, Maybe"

I love drama movies to the core personally and i happened to see this movie without expecting much,just a few light-hearted moments and i thought it would be over.But i was so wrong, this movie had more than romance and comedy to it. It had a soul to carry over and the portrayal of Ryan Reynolds as Will Hayes is mind blowing. Will's just some guy next door in the movie but every guy next door has a soul right? and a story to tell.Next to him Abigail Breslin is the show stealer.Performances by all the lead actresses are wonderful despite the story focusing on will's character.Rachel Weisz in particular as a career oriented girl was awesome. Adam Brooks succeeds in bringing out the emotions very well. In my opinion the emotions are not seen on screen rather they are felt off screen,by us.The wide spectra of emotions like love, pain, loneliness, anger, betrayal and most of all hope are felt by an attentive viewer.This is not just a time-pass movie, i would say its an awesome experience into someone's life and don't miss it.This movie has an everlasting effect on me.

I have my qualms, don't get me wrong, but I enjoyed the story, how it was told, and Ryan Reynolds did a good job playing a loving father almost completely convincingly, Abigail Breslin was a charm to watch, but she always is, and the three girlfriends of Reynolds throughout the movie were convincing enough, the best being Isla Fisher, hands down.As to plot, the movie was fun, nothing overly complicated, but still entertaining, and refreshingly, it didn't end quite as I expected, but still predictable.Overall, a very entertaining movie, my only complaint is that it was far too long. At 2 hours and 10 minutes, you almost don't care how the movie ends, as long as it DOES END eventually. BUT, don't let that stop you from seeing it. Don't expect anything mind blowing, just be ready for a long, mindless, yet entertaining movie.7/10","Definitely, Maybe"

144,ucanusemy,Saw an advance screening and actually enjoyed it!,7,18 January 2008,"and that's saying a lot since I'm not a ""romantic comedy"" kind of gal.The little girl is fabulous. Good casting. She's adorable without being perfect. Kevin Kline was an absolute delight as an unapologetic drunken writer/professor who also happens to be quite full of himself. Rachel Weisz (whom I normally do not care for) was completely (and unexpectedly) charming. Ryan Reynolds was also a good casting choice. Unexpectedly believable as a dad.The bulk of the movie is him explaining to his daughter, bedtime story style (told entirely in flashbacks) about love and how he met her mother, with her being the proverbial ""happy ending"". Except ... she seems to be the only one who notices that her Dad really isn't happy at all. Isla Fisher also shines. Watching her character grow from someone who is completely devoid of any direction or purpose into a real woman, complete with self-esteem, was a nice touch.Loved the relationship stories. It's amazing what you don't see when you are in a relationship, only to come to a realization much later. Anyone who has ever traded a trip on the QEII for a proverbial three hour tour on the S.S. Minnow relationship-wise will totally relate.The fact that Ryan Reynolds sometimes gets so carried away with the story that he forgets he is talking to a little girl leads to a few (ok, so it's a lot) contrived chuckles along with a couple of genuinely funny moments.It's not going to win an Oscar or break a box office record, but if you want a completely enjoyable two hour escape ... see this movie.","Definitely, Maybe"

Im so moved by this movie and it made me cry and made me happy at the same time.

The story about girls was not so bad, quite interesting, with details and we didn't know how it will end. Just that little girl was too intelligent for a girl, she was aware of everything, unbelievable... The girls especially April was perfect, just the man was stupid not to choose her... A lot of romantics elements, f.e. kisses, time in bed and so on, it is not so bad. The end was unpredictable, often this type of films ends in other way, the end was good, really good, just one thing.. Let's think realistically.. How can little girl be happy that his father found other woman who is not her mum,I don't believe that, but anyway, the end was not so bad..

Not a lover of romcoms but not a hater either (if you put it in that category, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is one of my all-time faves).I looked at the cast and I figured it'd be worth spending a couple of hours looking at this. I mean, all three of the contenders are lookers and Ryan Reynolds is usually entertaining enough. Last but not least, sweet Abigail from Little Miss Sunshine is back.So good cast. Also, there were some nice and friendly tunes during the movie that really kept me from looking away and that did a great job in preventing the silence (even though i thought the whole nirvana thing was a tad bit overused).The plot was not bad at all, and the filmmakers obviously know what they're doing by using clever little tricks to draw you and they do succeed, at a certain level.However, and apart from a few good scenes (specially in Will's birthday, when he ""comes out"" to beautiful April), I can't really say I took much from this movie. The whole book-keeping-because-it-was-the-only-part-of-you-I-had-left excuse was very much expected (and I found myself wishing he wouldn't say that) and, in the end, this movie was not so captivating as it could have been.Still, a lot of pretty faces, gentle humor, decent acting and a simple and inviting score that will aim to please.6/10","Definitely, Maybe"

You love each others - you should be together. End of story. But he does such a beautiful job explaining to her the choices and changes in his life that led him to the point he was at (divorcing her mother) that it was really sweet and heartwarming.Breslin is adorable as the precocious daughter and Isla Fisher was absolutely perfect as April.Definitely a MUST SEE for any divorce parent whose had to have that talk!,"Definitely, Maybe"

Also perhaps the film could have ended sooner (maybe when Maya discovers who her mother is). Maya (Little Miss Sunshine) shows a promising future in acting, and Ryan Reynolds seems to make a good attempt at more serious acting, but he still reminds me of ""that guy from Just Friends who wants to be the next Jim Carrey"".

Unfortunately, it's overlong, and more that just a little dull. The story meanders from place to place and when the conclusion comes, instead of thinking ""Oh, that's so lovely"", you're thinking ""All that for this?"" The acting is fine, but it's not a well written film, and could have done with about 30 mins knocked off in the editing room, or substituted some of the touchy/feely father/daughter interplay, for some laughs.

155,capggg,Has its heart in the right place but don't expect much outside of a few good performances.,6,13 February 2008,"Decent but contrived comedy that has its heart in the right place but depends more on old plot twists than telling a compelling story. The mystery of who's the mom of Abigail Breslin's character is really easy if you're in tune to the laws of romantic comedies and the story of how it happens just does not jell very well at all. It's more a romantic who dun it than a romantic comedy and you get bored after a while with it, especially when you can see the ending already before the actual film ends. But the film has its heart in the right place and it's not hard to like it, especially if you have a few very good performances that are giving the film more than it deserves. Ryan Reynolds does a great job as the hero of the piece and he has great chemistry with Rachel Weisz, who is just flat out fun, sexy and charismatic. Kevin Klein is fun as well as the other man in Weisz's characters life. Too bad for Reynolds though that both Weisz and Klein are not in the film that much because they are the best things about this movie and while they are not on screen, Reynolds basically has to fiend for himself in dealing with less interesting characters and predicament and that's where the film begins to lose its charm. Isla Fisher is adorable and sweet but there is nothing much to her character that we have not seen before and Elisabeth Banks is fine with a character that she manages to give some life to despite the fact of how one dimensional she is.The film has a warm heart but it takes quite a lot for it to make the viewer forget how contrived it really is and its loses its focus on what it wants to be and that's not a good thing if you want the viewer to stay interested in it.","Definitely, Maybe"

The acting is pretty bad, the story very unbelievable. Would an 11 year old girl help her Dad get back together with an ex-girlfriend on the day he divorces her mother? I think not.The protagonist just seemed to me to be desperate, happy to be with any of the three women, however they probably all lost interest in him. The sideline of the Bill Clinton 1992 campaign was an interesting background to the story. All in all I just found this film to be a waste of time, I'm sorry I watched it, but after 90 minutes I felt I had invested so much tie in it I had better see it through to its conclusion.","Definitely, Maybe"

Just thought I would point out that no matter how the movie ended, whether Reynolds ended up with Emily, Summer or April, everyone would say that it was predictable, which in turn means that the ending was entirely unpredictable. So while the audience may view any of the endings as plausible, it does not mean that the entire audience can predict the actual ending.On a side note, I would have been pleased with the movie ending at the zoo, with both parents walking away from each other.

Smart, funny, and wonderfully acted, it's romantic comedy done right.First and foremost, it's wonderfully written. Every character is self-consistent and fully likable, which makes the movie a joy to watch. The story can be as far fetched as you like if the characters within it adhere to a consistent reality - in fact, when characters are consistent, you WANT exceptional things to happen to them. I'm willing to suspend my disbelief wholeheartedly as long as I sense the characters are not being asked to do the same. You can forgive the few contrivances in this story because each contributes meaningfully to the overall plot without distorting it.Secondly, it's wonderfully cast and played. Strong performances all around.Finally, this movie gets better the more you watch it.","Definitely, Maybe"

It's not. I was lucky to catch this in an NYU film class, and I can say that most people left the screening with a happy feeling and a light heart. It was refreshing -- the writer (who also directs it) is genius because of the treacherous plot line that he pulled off flawlessly and because of the character development, again, flawless and credible. It's not a movie that will make you view the world differently per se, but you may review the way you think about a few things and you may feel inspired about being an everyday person. Isla Fisher is really magnetic and a heart-winning actor. My lord Reynolds is handsome, too.

First of all, the scene where Summer runs into Will and tells him that she's pregnant, and then goes on to say that she ""doesn't need a man"" made me so angry. Yet another selfish woman who ""doesn't need a man to raise her child."" How disgusting! Just because YOU don't ""need a man"" doesn't mean that your child should be denied a father. I couldn't imagine growing up without my dad. But I digress. Basically, this movie showed me how low our society's standards have fallen. The ending was awful (I was hoping against hope that Maya's mom and dad would get their stuff together and make an intact home for their daughter), but definitely, again, showcased the mentality that so many adults have these days: What matters most is MY happiness, not my child's. If my child has to grow up in a broken home, so be it. OH, and showing Maya as ""excited"" for her dad to date a woman other than her mom was laughable at best. REEEAAALLLY, a kid who is actually happy that her parent has a sexual relationship with anyone other than mom or dad? Suuuuure. Although I'm sure that this made all the ""blended"" families out there ecstatic. And don't get me started on the Clinton crap.

No matter how many people you get to tell you that you're OK, you're doing the right thing, the feeling of wrongness will never, ever go away. The continual need, even demands, for affirmation and acceptance of these damaging actions and lifestyles demonstrate the truth. No words put into a child actress' mouth will make it better. It is one more lie into a never satisfied void. Only the truth will set you free.This movie was a disgusting train wreck, a farce. Stay home with a copy of ""The Death of the Grown-Up"" by Diana West, and be afraid. Be very afraid.","Definitely, Maybe"
168,robert_nickel,A Happy Ending?,4,15 February 2008,"The tag line for this movie says, ""It may not be too late for a happy ending."" We thought that meant, ""There's a happy ending."" What it really meant is, ""It's too late for a happy ending."" Unless, that is, if you don't believe in marriage. Or if you are happy to watch a sweet girl painfully watching her parents divorce despite her impotent (and ultimately futile) effort to help them rediscover each other. Or if you enjoy seeing a man blowing chance after chance with the girl he really loves and who really loves him until it is 10 years too late.Personally, when my wife and I went made this movie our choice for Valentine's Day, we weren't looking to walk out depressed, but that's what happened.I will say that the movie was well executed. We very much enjoyed all the characters, especially April and the Professor, which only made it that much worse for us to watch their lives fall apart.If you're looking for a sad commentary on the wasted state of today's American Society, this may be your movie. If you're looking for a fun and uplifting date movie, and especially if you're trying to celebrate your marriage... look elsewhere.","Definitely, Maybe"

I love the cast, all players are great, script is very well written, and it's a good movie back to front.

173,JeffNew72,Adorable,8,28 November 2018,"I am a sucker for the romantic comedy, but there is nothing I hate worse than a cheesy one. Ok, so maybe they are all a bit cheesy, but I have fallen victim to the formula of watching two souls destined to be together and the story it takes to get them there. Wow...I just realized. I AM cheesy!And, thus, I have fallen hard for Definitely, Maybe. Unlike most romantic comedies, this one is centered primarily around the adorable young actress Abigail Breslin from Little Miss Sunshine, another one of my favorites. Abigail plays the precious young Maya, daughter of underrated hunky actor Ryan Reynolds (yes, I said it), who plays former Clinton-campaign worker-turned-ad-man Will Hayes, who wants desperately to make sense of her parents' divorce and to see her father happy. As with any little girl, the fantasy romance plays heavily in her belief-system about love, thus she begs her father to explain how she came to be, and how he came to marry the woman from whom he is obtaining a divorce. The movie weaves an intricate and pretty realistic set of scenarios (although all of them together seems a bit far-fetched) on how men and women decide to enter and eventually exit relationships.As the story moves its way through the film, the viewer is introduced to a myriad of attractive and unique female supporting cast members, played by Elizabeth Banks (Emily/Sarah), Rachel Weisz (Summer/Natasha) and the eventual owner of Will's heart, the immensely sexy Isla Fisher (April).The writing and directing of Adam Brooks sucks the viewer into the narration just as much as young Maya. I found myself trying to figure out where the story was going and making openly verbal guesses as to what would happen next. At no point did the story get old or boring. And, by the end, I found myself tearing up.Having come from a divorced family myself, and at times, nearing divorce in my own marriage, it's movies like this that do a very REAL job of expressing what questions and emotions children go through as their life changes through no fault of their own. It's heartbreaking. And Maya's quest to make sense of it all through this story is as much part of her own healing as it is Will's. And, in the end, they both do everything they can to find the happy ending. Like any good romantic comedy, the predictable happy ending does indeed come.Supporting cast members Elizabeth Banks, Rachel Weisz and her lover, the perfectly-cast Kevin Kline, do a tremendous job giving depth to the story and providing a realistic view of how all of us migrate through our 20s and early-to-mid 30s beginning as enthusiastic, yet naive, adults to realistic and somewhat cynical thirtysomethings. Being one myself, I was taken aback by the transformation of each character as they become more mature, having gone down their own individual paths, eventually leading Will and April back together.I have been waiting for the rest of the world to realize just how great Ryan is since the first episode I saw of Two Guys, A Girl and a Pizza Place. I was convinced he was Jim Carrey's younger brother. Now, I realize he is not only good looking on screen, but also deadpan funny (see Waiting, Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle and Just Friends)and superbly believable in dramatic (or non-funny) roles, as evidenced in Definitely, Amityville Horror and Blade:Trinity. When I saw the trailers for Definitely, Maybe, I thought (pardon the pun), maybe Ryan had finally found the vehicle, the writer/director and the supporting cast to show the rest of the world just what a phenomenal talent he is. Alas, the movie did ok, but this wonderful movie didn't receive the accolades it so richly deserves.While there is no need for a sequel, I encourage you to rent or buy this film on DVD to not only see a great film, but financially support future films like this.","Definitely, Maybe"
174,gc-spurs,"Definitely for romcom fans, even Maybe for the boys!",9,30 June 2008,"The genre of romantic comedies these days is one which finds its self with the worse movies Hollywood has produced. The standard is getting lower and lower. Whilst these movies are generally entertaining enough, it is nice to get a gulp of fresh air. Definitely, Maybe follows that general romcom formula of girl and guy meet, guy stuffs up but through some romantic gesture gets girl in the end. However unlike typical romcoms, it has the additional pizzaz of the 'mystery' of the mother, and the creativity that can be encompassed by the constant time shifts.I watched this movie the other day on the plane on a 12 hr flight. It was the first movie I watched that day. I watched another comedy right after, and I found myself bored, wanting that movie to end so I could re-watch Definitely, Maybe. And so, for the remainder of the flight, I just kept watching this movie over and over again.The general plot synopsis is that after a sexual education lesson, a young girl, Maya (Amber Breslin), questions her father about his past relationships and of how he came to be married with her mother, as he is in the middle of their divorce. The father- William Hayes (Ryan Reynolds), embarks on his story of 3 women whom he loved, each potentially could be Maya's mother, relayed through flashback recollections, leaving the mystery of the mother's identity with the viewers and with Maya.Ryan Reynolds has previously showed us he is the master of asshole, playboy, funny guy, pretty boy types. His prior roles have had us laughing out loud. It was a nice change to see him play a relatively innocent and sensitive character, and he nailed the part. The chemistry between him and his on screen daughter, Amber Breslin, was entertaining and at times very touching. Breslin again delivers her role with a flair beyond her years. Isla Fisher plays a potential mother for Maya in the story. She was the red haired, fun, free spirited, outspoken girl with no sense of direction in life. She manages to really bring a real life into her character, showing the character development where necessary. Rachel Weiss plays another potential candidate. She manages to do the opposite of Fisher, portraying the lack of growth in her character. Her first scene in the movie is one of my favourites.I would highly recommend this for fans of the romcom genre as it will not leave you disappointed. As for those who aren't particularly receptive of the genre, I guarantee that this one is actually worth a watch and will most Definitely not put you to sleep.","Definitely, Maybe"

176,jeffhouseman,Notable erosion of Clinton 'Legacy',8,20 February 2008,"There is a subplot with the main character having his idealistic outlook on life torn down by the real world. A big part of the tear down are video clips of President Bill Clinton's early dalliance with Jennifer Flowers, his shaking his finger at the world and stating that he didn't have sex with 'that woman, Monica Lewinski', and pondering what the meaning of 'is' is. As a fresh scrubbed and enthusiastic campaign supporter of Clinton's campaign, he felt betrayed.The point of this comment is that the major movie critics have pretty much panned this delightful movie that dared not to reach too far in its RomCom genre. Maybe I'm paranoid, but I think the negative portrayal of Sir Bill contributed to those bad reviews; I expected it after seeing the movie, and it spurred me to look at movie sites and to check my theory out. I was not disappointed.","Definitely, Maybe"

I don't know if guys will like it but me and my cousin loved it! Ryan Reynolds and Abigail Breslin were great. I love Abigail she is so cute! Isla Fisher is hilarious. I have seen her in Wedding Crashers and I think she was in Enchanted also. Anyway, her character is so funny and off the wall.

179,csamuel-6,A Must See For All Breakup-ees,10,6 March 2008,"Okay, in the interests of full disclosure, I have to come clean. I'm a 25 year-old guy who has just gone through a tough breakup, so I'm going to be all over anything (or anyone) that tells me I'll eventually be able to move on and mend my wretched heart.That being said, I am ALL OVER this movie! I thought that it was incredibly refreshing to see a Hollywood romantic comedy that didn't follow the ""one girl for every guy"" convention that we commonly see. It wasn't a simple or straightforward narrative; the concept of love was presented as a complex, evolving, and confusing creature. For that alone, you should see this movie. Even as the movie ends, you get the sense that it could continue following the lives of these characters for 20 more years, and there would still be an abundance of stories left to be told.Moreover, it does all this while showing that a guy (and not just any guy, but Van Wilder!) can be emotionally vulnerable and wounded. I don't know when or how it happened, but sometime recently, it became acceptable for a guy to admit to having his heart broken. As a heartbroken guy: That. Is. Awesome. (Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to play my guitar and write poetry in my candlelit room).""Definitely, Maybe"" doesn't just stop there. Cached away within the overarching theme of LOVE (written across the sky in big letters), the movie deals with how a child struggles to understand her parent's divorce, how political idealism can fade into cynicism, and how true friendships can withstand the flow of time. Yeah, that's right - a romantic-comedy that has sub-themes. Dig it!Oh yeah - and to top it off, it's actually a *good* movie! The characters are developed, and the acting is good. The movie paces itself well - it was over before I knew it, which I always find to be a good sign. It's not perfect - it has a fairly dismissive treatment of bisexuality, for example - but it gets more than enough bonus marks to make up for it.If you're going through a breakup, then here is some further random advice: -Treat yourself, and make it a solo date with just you. Go out for dinner before the movie, and bring a favorite book to keep yourself company. Better yet, spend some time in a bookstore and make sure you get something for yourself. -Bring a notepad with you, and jot down anything and everything that you might want to remember from the movie (song titles, memorable lines, anything). -Don't be afraid to cry at the movie. You'll never see those other people again (at least, that's what I'm telling myself today).","Definitely, Maybe"

The move is very entertaining, very romantic, and will play on your nostalgic side if you have one. If you're a 20 something that has been in and out of some significant relationships, this will hit close to home, in a positive way. I wouldn't suggest this movie for a first date because it's not quite light-hearted and happy enough. Watch this one on a second or third date OR watch it with someone you've known for a while who you are about to reveal your feelings to. I promise you - it'll set you up nicely...","Definitely, Maybe"

Clearly it was either product placement or they're fakes but I want to know if they are real and if so I WANT THEM! All other bluetooth headsets are very noticeable that your wearing them or there are cords. But these were just the earbuds. If anybody has any info please post. Thanks.As for the movie, I thought it was OK, for a chick flick it was well made, even though it reminded me of watching the princess bride when the grandfather reads the story to his grandson and the film keeps switching from story to real time.

As for some of you who's just typical and are willing to criticize about movies, this is not for you.Yes this is about Will Hayes(Ryan Reynolds) who tells her little daughter the story of his love life. Of course some people will disagree with a father telling his daughter the love story which may contain sexual material. however i liked the plot line how i had to wait till the end to know who he was really in love with, and who his divorced wife was.i rate it 10/10","Definitely, Maybe"

When I saw the commercials I thought the movie might have more of Abagail Breslin. But it showed her in 2 scenes for a total of five minutes. This movie was like the writer was writing the script, and then went in a coma and continued it with a different plot! (comedy/drama) which is boring. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.

I really enjoyed the story, especially what little conversation I could hear above the overpowering music background. Did anyone involved with the production of this movie review the movie? Can you tell me what the loud background music that blocked out most of the conversations added to this movie? It's a romantic movie, NOT A MUSICAL.

They are usually quite predictable. My affection is hung up in my need to suspend reality and feel warm and fuzzy. This one does both - but with the benefit of a little tension and anticipation. A definite plus! The women all outline faulty and fine characters. The lead actor is flawed though typically gorgeous (I've liked him in some former TV roles). Worth a rental.","Definitely, Maybe"
186,boazchristian,Its like a book you can't put down,10,28 July 2008,"This is a very smart, intelligent piece. Just watch the first ten minutes and see if you can stop and turn it off. You can't and won't. As the late Joel Siegel would have said, it is superb story telling.It has a unique vantage point in that the love story is told from the mind's prism of a small girl caught up in her parents break up. None of the characters are forgettable, even the ones with smaller roles add to the mosaic of this depiction of American life. This is a full breadth New York story that comes close in its storytellingto the real romantic lives of the many Americans transplanted there, with all their sadness, tragedy and hope, having another American biggie, politics as a backdrop. It is a powerful depiction of those two common American maladies known as 'the break up' and its follow up 'the heart break' and the search for the illusive thing we call love. A great American romance movie, satisfying, I am sure, even to those automatons among us who, forced to watch it, with our better halves, will end up rusting from tears. It's already a classic.","Definitely, Maybe"

I realized that we watch movies because we need to feel and this movie defines the specific feelings of love, the wait, the uncertainty, the sweetness, chaos, resolute, respect, chance, maturity, humbleness, family and more.I recommend this movie for couples in relationship trouble or couples that want to strengthen their relationship and/or reminder on the process of dating and love.It will definitely make you crave for more emotions.","Definitely, Maybe"
188,royjet,movie went south the instant April came on the screen,2,14 February 2009,"I liked the lead character played nicely by Ryan Reynolds in the beginning of the film and the premise had a certain appeal. Having not seen a good romantic comedy in a long while I thought I'd give it a chance. But when April entered the scene it went straight downhill. It's really hard to root for your hero or leading man when the 'obvious' from the start winner of his love and affection is a cold, nasty, self consumed and snide, neo-conservative witch. Yes. April truly is a girl you can hate. As my mother use to say when I was a boy. 'Beware of women with thin lips.' If only she had lost some of that snide, quick to judge attitude by the end of the picture. If only April changed in some endearing way, maybe showed some inkling of compassion and social responsibility by wearing an Eco shirt or something to demonstrate the expansion of her heart and mind. That would have helped. But there was no arc at all in this picture. Not even for the lead character, Will. In fact I liked him better in the beginning of the picture than I did in the end before he turned into a subservient mushball to Ms. Razor lips. When the movie began he had passion, dreams and ideals. By the end of the story we see a lonely hearted cynical Will shaking his head with self righteous disapproval at Bill Clinton all because he doesn't stop in the middle of his run to speak to him after Will calls out, ""I worked on your 92 campaign."" We're suppose to assume that the president would actually jog go over and sit on a park bench to chat with Will? Invite him to lunch? Please get real. A quick wave is about all you can expect from anybody in his position, especially in the middle of a run. Check out Holiday for a good romantic comedy with characters you can actually care about.","Definitely, Maybe"
189,wkstar-2,"My review of Definitely, Maybe",8,14 May 2009,"This is actually a really good and cute movie. The three leading women are extraordinary and although I don't love the casting of Ryan Reynolds as the leading male (he is too young), he actually does a pretty good job. But the real star of the movie is his daughter: Abigail Breslin as Maya. She is charming, cute and in the end it's not hard to see her as your own fictional daughter.The three women he is dating are all charming and perfectly cast, although Rachel Weisz really stands out. As a decent singer too! The score of the movie is great and really enhances the mood of the scenes for the viewer.The humor in this movie can be pretty corny (downright bad) at times. Maybe it's more suitable for women which is what it is intended for I guess.It's the kind of movie you can watch again and again. And if you do, you will have knowledge of where the actors are coming from and why they behave as they do. I think that makes a movie stand out as being intelligent.If you've enjoyed ""Serendipity"" and ""When Harry met Sally"" you will definitely (maybe?) enjoy this movie as well.","Definitely, Maybe"
190,volleyball_babe099,Which One is She?,8,16 July 2009,"Although the director (Adam Brooks) needed a good movie to get him back on track because of his last movie, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason. Will Hayes (Ryan Reynolds) is playing the dad of Maya (Abigail Breslin). Maya wants to know the real story of how her mother and father had met. She thinks that by knowing the story she can get them back together. Will decided he was going to make it a game and replace all of the women's names with fake ones. However, when Will is done telling the story, Maya has to decide which of the ladies her mother was. Will starts out telling the story with his college sweetheart Emily (Elizabeth Banks), moves on to a crazy red-head April (Isla Fisher), and then the copy lady Summer (Rachel Weisz.) After hearing the story, Maya learns that love is not easy. When children ask about questions, parents usually are not ready to reveal the real story. Will made his past relationships into a game. Even though he did not think she was old enough to know the real story, it was the only thing that was going to make her happy. Whether that really is the real story, they will never know. Parents should throw in some twists and turns to the story to make things interesting. These types of instances happen to most parents at one time or another.People can usually figure out what is going on in the movie and guess what is going to happen at the end. This movie is not so straightforward. The director makes a lot of twists and turns so that at some point during the movie one thinks each girl is the one that is his wife. He does a very good job at confusing one's mind and making it a guessing game. This is a good romantic love and mystery story.","Definitely, Maybe"
191,mscoldiron,"""Sometime we need a little corny""",8,4 June 2010,"I loved this movie. It's one of the few romantic comedies that center around a man which I would recommend. It's perfect for those people like me who are hopeless romantics. With that said it is a little corny and if you can't figure out the story within 30 min, you might be a little slow on the uptake. While I found it a little predictable, it is definitely a feel good movie. The cast has great chemistry, leading to a story that flows well. It's a believable story with a few good chuckles scattered throughout the movie. If it wasn't for the fact that the female leads are amazingly beautiful, I'd feel like it could happen to me. Some of the things that he and his daughter say are actually pretty funny. While not quite a must see, if you have some free time, I can think of far worse wastes of time that I've seen recently.","Definitely, Maybe"

I thought, crap another chick flick...grrrrr. I'm regretting I thought that. This movie was very well put together. Sure it's about love and there no explosions or rappelling down cliffs while firing semi automatic rifles but I liked it anyway.The casting was excellent and direction was superior. You could feel the chemistry between the actors. I have to warn you that if you're a sensitive person you may want a box of tissue close by.Adam Brooks actually directed and wrote this movie and hats go off to him for this one. I give it an 8 out of 10. If he had thrown in a car chase or blew up a few buildings it may have received a 10 (just kidding).","Definitely, Maybe"
193,skeet_33,Mediocre story; Not really a romantic movie,2,18 February 2008,"As the plot summary puts it, the father ""hopelessly attempts to tell his 10 yr old daughter a PG version of his romantic history"" -- an attempt at which he fails. His romantic history is interesting and engaging for the audience, but the backdrop of him telling these stories, rich with sexual content, to his young daughter gives the movie an undeniable ""icky"" factor.Without giving anything away, what starts the whole conversation is that the daughter finds out about intercourse in sex-ed class at elementary school, much to her shock. On the heels of that revelation, what father would launch into a lengthy story of his romantic and sexual past with his innocent young daughter? The daughter's immediate and open acceptance that there are other women in her father's life besides her mother, while a nice morally liberal idea, I found rather unrealistic.The father's romantic storyline isn't bad, but tying it all together with the young daughter made it a bit disturbing, soiled the romantic tone, and ultimately spoiled the movie for me.Not recommended.","Definitely, Maybe"
194,pebblebeach3,I found this movie light and enjoyable,7,5 July 2008,"Wife and I were tired of movies full of violence so I rented this flick and I don't normally go to these types of movies. I enjoyed this one perhaps identifying with the fathers dealing with his daughters questions as I have had to do with two daughters and now with three grand daughters. I go to movies to enjoy myself and for 90 minutes get away from serious thoughts and this movie did the trick. I thought it peculiar that Kevin Klein received no billing on the Jacket nor in here. Such a box office leading man receiving no billing at all is weird to this movie goer. I expect we will see more of Ryan Reynolds who seems to be climbing the ladder of leading men. All of the female actresses were easy on the eye and did a good job of portraying their various roles. I did not think the writing came up to the standard of Notting Hill, which was full of one liners that were brilliant.","Definitely, Maybe"
195,77pickles,I liked this movie,8,11 February 2009,"I would likely have never seen this film if it hadn't been on cable. So for me it was a bit of serendipity to find it. The short description in the guide said ""Divorcing dad Ryan Reynolds tells his daughter of his romantic past"". Since I am a divorced dad with a daughter I thought I'd give it a shot. No, there aren't parallels between the events in this film and my own life. But it is a good story and I liked trying to figure out which of the women was the girls mother. I got it wrong of course which made it that much more enjoyable. The little girl is precocious which makes it enjoyable. And she is at that age where daddy can do no wrong. I don't know if eleven is the right age to tell a young daughter all that he told her. But, the time to tell children what they want to know is often when they ask.At some point I was hoping that her father and mother would get back together but of course that wasn't going to happen. In modern films that is never the case. But it is nice that the girl is a romantic at heart and really loves her dad and wants him to be happy.","Definitely, Maybe"

Ryan Reynolds is excellent as the lead. He fills his role perfectly with a natural ease and charisma that makes his character completely believable and likable. Before this I had only seen him in Van Wilder and TV shows so I was surprised with just how impressive he is as a leading man. The supporting cast are brilliant, especially Abigail Breslin and Isla Fisher.I really enjoyed this movie, it's definitely better than most romantic comedies I've seen in the past year and it's not clichéd.

I thought this was just your typical cheesy finding-the-right-one movie but it wasn't. Definitely, maybe, you could say truly a 'maybe' story because of the complexities of the protagonist's love life along with his ever inquisitive daughter brought mainly by the influences from school. At first, you could see a father whose intention was to answer the question of his daughter regarding her mother's identity through a fairy tale-like manner just to be apt, mysterious and enticing for her. Along the series of story-telling, you would say that it was certainly Emily but after a moment, you got confused because of another tie with some other significant girls. With that sense, the delivery was just so clever that you would be dragged and forced to finish the movie with satisfaction of the pacing.As for the romance side, it was reasonable. Will was just a guy capable of being hurt and moving on; that it's hard to get into another relationship when you still have lingering feelings with the break- up but you need to move on for the sake of your own happiness. He has reasons why he ended with multiple girls. The women involved had their own aspects that you could love and hate as viewer. Much to say, the run or building up of the romance was so realistic and frank. Nevertheless, he truly ended up with the right one.Also, the political side added some wittiness among the colloquialism of the characters.I couldn't say in detail the entirety of the movie but it is definitely a recommended movie. You will love, laugh, be warmed, confused, hurt and satisfied with the conveyance of the story. So, see it for yourself.","Definitely, Maybe"
199,nicholieeee,very cute,8,15 February 2008,"i have to say, i was slightly skeptical of this movie at first. since its from the creators of love actually, i was afraid they were going to try and recreate that movie. nonetheless, i was excited to see it because love actually is one of my favorite movies. this movie does not disappoint. it doesn't quite reach the brilliance of love actually, but it holds its own. ryan reynolds plays the character he always plays in romantic comedies, but who cares, he's good at it. i was worried that isla fisher would be obnoxious and annoying, but she was quite entertaining. abigail breslin was absolutely adorable. anyway, if you're looking for a cinematic work of art, maybe you should skip this. but if you're looking to be entertained for two hours, definitely see this movie. i can't say enough good things about it.","Definitely, Maybe"

201,hmk-01071,Definetly Not Anything Special,7,21 February 2019,"This movie is about Will Hayes (Ryan Reynolds), a 38 year old father who is in the middle of getting a divorce, when his 10 year old daughter, Maya (Abigail Breslin) asks him about how he and her mother met. Will shares with Maya the ups and downs of his past three romances before his marriage, with women who in the story he calls, Emily (Elizabeth Banks), Summer (Rachel Weisz), and April (Isla Fisher) as Maya tries to guess who her mother is. Through this experience, Will and his daughter build a stronger relationship and Maya helps her father find happiness. Definetly, Maybe portrayed modern and powerful social commentary on love and was a refreshing twist from your typical romantic comedy, however, its blandness in quality of cinematography and character portrayal made it an overall mediocre movie.
To start, I enjoyed watching Definetly, Maybe because of its powerful and meaningful social commentary on love. Throughout the film, there are many crucial themes, however, the overarching one being that love is simply not how it's portrayed in fairy tales; complicated and imperfect. First off, the movie begins with the situation of Will Hayes telling his daughter this story during the midst of his divorce with his wife. From the beginning it shows how love doesn't always work out. The film shows us how love is complicated; people divorce, fall in love too soon or too late, settle and have regrets. The movie exemplifies how in love people won't necessarily love you back when you love them, however, love is patient and honest. This movie also highlighted the effects a divorce can have on a family. It shows how it impacts everyone, especially the children, however through it can have a ""happy ending."" In the movie, Will explains to Maya how the happy ending of his love story with her mother, was having her. Lastly, in each relationship in the movie, Will settles for woman knowing that he actually wants to be with someone else. The ending however, shows us how when you don't settle and follow your heart, then you'll reap true happiness.
This movie was also notable for its refreshing take on a typical romantic comedy. As a romantic comedy movie-fanatic, I have seen many rom-coms and this one definetly stood out with its unique plot organization. The usage of telling three different love stories, kept the viewers engaged and made the plot interesting. Also, by telling what Maya called a ""love story mystery"" the plot was unpredictable and constantly had me hooked to see what was going to happen next. However, its plot still comprises of crucial elements to a great rom-com, sadness and conflict and a happy ending.
However, in my opinion, I felt that the cinematography and character portrayal were boring, making it an overall mediocre movie. First off, the lighting and camera work were normal; nothing really stood out. It zoomed up on the kissing scenes and had the typical dark lighting for the romantic scenes. However, most of its lighting was dictated by the daylight and had no use of special effects or enticing props. Also, for me, soundtracks of movies can really separate an okay movie from a great movie. I felt that the only big usage of music was in the introduction of the film, and at that, I still didn't understand the significance of that song choice. Furthermore, due to its lack of creativity in these areas I felt the movie fell short of being great. Also, I love Ryan Reynolds, especially in romantic comedies because he is so attractive, charming and talented. However, I felt that in this movie he lacked his profound sense of humor he usual posses in other films. For example, I think he did a great job in The Proposal, however I didn't think this was one of his best films. Also, even though the three women in the movie were beautifully portrayed, since there were three rather than one women lead role, it was hard for each to be given adequate screen time. Furthermore, the film lacked character development, which left me unsettled with lots of questions.
I would give this movie a solid 7/10. I am a huge fan of romantic-comedies, thus it was sweet, funny and simple, all qualities of what a rom-com should be, but didn't leave me with anything special. Although Definetly, Maybe portrayed modern and powerful social commentary on love and was a refreshing twist from your typical romantic comedy, its blandness in lighting, music and camerawork, and character portrayal made it an overall mediocre movie. I thought that it was an overall sweet movie, that teens and older children would appeal to. As well, it wasn't a typical love story, but had a sense of mystery, which I found made it enjoyable and engaging for me. Moreover, after the movie, I left with a feeling similar to when you've just ate a good dinner, but you're still longing for a little dessert to top it off.","Definitely, Maybe"
