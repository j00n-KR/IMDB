0,SnoopyStyle,Cate Blanchett terrific,7,23 February 2014,"Jessica King (Katie Holmes), the fiancée of Wayne Collins (Greg Kinnear), has gone missing. Annabelle Wilson (Cate Blanchett) is the local psychic who has visions of Jessica King. Following her advise, Sheriff Pearl Johnson (J.K. Simmons) dredges the swamp and finds Jessica's body. Donnie Barksdale (Keanu Reeves) is jailed for the murder. However, Annabelle keeps getting visions. There's more to the murder.Director Sam Raimi has teamed up with Billy Bob Thornton once again and this time as a writer. Cate Blanchett is terrific. There is an overload of big time actors. I almost wish that some of the lesser roles get played by smaller unknown actors. When it's overloaded like this, the movie can feel very Hollywood. However Blanchett never once feels fake in any way. She becomes the character with ease.",The Gift
1,Hitchcoc,I Always Seem to Guess Right,7,22 April 2016,"I was hooked on this show, even though in the end I had it all figured out. That said, Cate Blanchett is very good as a mother who is doing what she can to keep a roof over her fatherless children. She unknowingly makes the mistake of advising a woman, played by Hillary Swank, who is being victimized by her ruthless husband, Keanu Reeves. He blames Blanchett for attempting to break out their marriage and threatens her family, describing how you skin a squirrel while looking at her little boys. He is a bastard. When Katie Holmes disappears, Cate is brought in to help find the body. Her psychic powers lead to the discovery and because Reeves had been seen beating the young woman, he is arrested and convicted of the murder. Of course, there is more to this and it's just too easy to put two and two together. The strong side of the film, however, is incredible atmosphere, especially in the scenes where Blanchett has visions and dreams. There is also a cloud hanging over everyone throughout the film. Her character is seen as a kind of witch by the huckleberries in the town. It's good at getting ones blood up, but it is a bit too manipulative at times.",The Gift
2,boblipton,With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility,7,17 June 2021,"Cate Blanchett is a widowed mother of three small boys in a southern town. She supports them all by reading the cards -- not Tarot, but what appear to be Duke University cards. She is subject to visions of her dead grandmother and dreams. When Greg Kinnear's fiancee disappears, the police reluctantly call Miss Blanchett, whose vision lead them to drag redneck Keanu Reeves' pond and find the corpse.Sam Raimi's movie is not a standard horror movie, but a meditation on the oppressiveness of having psychic abilities, or indeed, different. It's populated with quite a distinguished list of actors, including J. K. Simmons, Michael Jeter, Katie Holmes, Hillary Swank, and Rosemary Harris. Given Raimi's varied credits -- he was working on SPIDERMAN while cutting this film -- it offers an interesting vision of what super-powers mean. Or perhaps, if you're not so inclined, some fine work on editing for atmosphere.",The Gift
3,gavin6942,Just Didn't Hit Home For Me,5,9 June 2009,"I'm not going to write a full review like I usually do, because I just didn't really care for this movie. Maybe I missed something and maybe I need to give it a second chance, but overall it seemed lacking.The cast is there: Cate Blanchett, Giovanni Ribisi, Keanu Reeves, Katie Holmes, Greg Kinnear and Hilary Swank. Reeves' acting, as usual, not being as powerful as one might like, especially from such a would-be threatening character. The director is there: Sam Raimi, a legend in horror.But I don't know. I wasn't drawn in, I found myself easily distracted. I don't want to say it was a bad film, but I just don't know what to say about it in a positive way. After feeling ""blah"" about it, I was finally lost with the supernatural elements. Just not my movie.",The Gift
4,lee_eisenberg,Sam Raimi's border,7,14 May 2010,"Some years after the Evil Dead trilogy and right before ""Spider-Man"", Sam Raimi directed ""The Gift"", starring Cate Blanchett as psychic Annie, whose ability is needed in a missing persons case. I thought that the movie was worth seeing, if not a masterpiece. The environs of the southern town where the movie is set seem to reflect the mysterious workings of Annie's mind: just about anything could be hidden there.While I didn't find this to be a bad movie, I simply felt as if it too closely resembled other movies that I had seen, and so that weakened it some. But otherwise, I recommend it. Strong acting, directing and visuals certainly net this one a higher than average ranking.Also starring Giovanni Ribisi, Keanu Reeves, Greg Kinnear, Katie Holmes, Rosemary Harris (whom Raimi later cast as Peter Parker's aunt May), J.K. Simmons (whom Raimi later cast as Peter Parker's boss) and Michael Jeter.",The Gift
5,jboothmillard,The Gift,5,6 September 2005,"I didn't see the beginning of this film, I started from when our ""heroine"" I suppose you could call her, troubled hero obviously, is looking in a crystal ball I think. Anyway, she has 'the gift' to see into the future, mostly deaths or something like that. Annabelle 'Annie' Wilson (Cate Blanchett) has lived with this 'gift' all of her life and she's been trying to use it for good, it's only when people become concerned that she has to go to court. Also starring Lost in Translation's Giovanni Ribisi as Buddy Cole, Keanu Reeves as Donnie Barksdale, Katie Holmes as Jessica King, Greg Kinnear as Wayne Collins, Hilary Swank as Valerie Barksdale, Michael Jeter as Gerald Weems, Kim Dickens as Linda, Gary Cole as David Duncan, Spider-Man's Rosemary Harris as Annie's Granny and Spider-Man's J.K. Simmons as Sheriff Pearl Johnson. A very interesting film from Spider-Man and The Evil Dead director Sam Raimi. Worth watching!",The Gift
6,rmax304823,Let us now praise Blanchett.,6,6 May 2006,"A widow with ESP (Cate Blanchett) lives with her son in a small Southern town, helping people by trying to ""read"" their futures and living on donations. There are folks who don't like that kind of devlish stuff 'round here. Katie disappears. Blanchett, who is one of those psychics who cannot control their ""visions"" so that she can only get glimpses of things that have happened or might happen, has a vision of Holmes' body at the bottom of a pond. She reveals her vision to the Sheriff (good performance by Dr. Emil Skoda, I mean J. K. Simmons). Well, he's one of the local empiricists and doesn't believe her but takes her out to a pond resembling the one seen in her vision. Sure enough. They drag Katie's remains out of it. Where was Tom Cruise when she needed him? I won't go on with the plot. It gets twisted around a bit and the end won't come as a great big surprise if you've seen a couple of other thrillers with metaphysical overtones.It was written by the co-authors of the far superior, ""One False Move."" But this is a pretty weak effort. We hear New Age lines from a bunch of small-minded townies. A man and a woman are attracted to one another but when he comes on to her, she backs hesitantly away and says, ""I don't think this is a good idea right now."" (The guy is falling-down drunk so it's hard to see what the idea was in the first place.) ""She's gone,"" the man tells the woman, ""but I have to learn to live with that, just as you have to learn to live with the loss of your husband."" (Real MEN don't talk like that.) And, later, ""I'm so sorry I wasn't there for you when you needed me."" The director, Raimi, is efficient without being in the least original. The music cues us about looming threats. When Blanchett is worried, a shadow crosses her curtain -- but it turns out to be a friend! As the climax approaching, to heighten the tension, there is a windy thunderstorm full of rain and strobe lightning. (Ho hum.) At the end, when all is being revealed, the rain is replaced by fog. One blow from a flashlight conks a full-grown man out for the duration just because the script calls for it.Blanchett is about to be murderized at the pond but she is saved by a disturbed young man whom she had earlier tried to help. The young man, Giovanni Ribisi, is supposed to be in a psychiatric hospital but, ""I escaped,"" he tells her. He doesn't tell her how he managed to find her and her would-be murderer in the middle of the woods in the middle of the night in the fog. Well, not that it matters, because it turns out that Ribisi has actually been dead for a couple of hours anyway. This takes us beyond the possibility of ESP and into the realm of the frankly supernatural. This raises certain interesting questions but the film doesn't address them. It's satisfied to be another everyday thriller with parallel universe harmonics.All of that makes it sound like a movie to avoid but it's not. The reason it's not is that mysteries are kind of interesting. Whodunnit, you know? And the movie is saved by Cate Blanchett's sterling performance. She makes the movie.She isn't exactly beautiful. She's lean and narrow shouldered. Her nose is long and pulpy, and her epicanthic fold is overdeveloped by Western tastes. But faces have characteristics or traits. Angelina Jolie's primary trait is sexuality. Gene Tierney's was staggering beauty. Agnes Moorehead's was sliminess of a particularly feminine sort. Blanchett's primary trait is perceptivity. Not intelligence in any academic sense, but an ability to figure things out, to see through them, to discern patterns and form Gestalts. This trait is put to good use, of course, in a role that calls for psychic abilities, but she showed the same ability to use her skills in ""Elizabeth"" too, where instead of hesitancy and anxiety the role called for a growing self confidence.Her accent alone is fascinating. Her Commonwealth speech is quite thoroughly transformed into Southernness here. It's not the hillbilly speech of the upland South, and it's not from the low country either. Its closest analog is probably Texas or Oklahoma. She has even the slightest of marks down right. ""I didn't really think anything OF it."" And the vowel is prolonged and drawn out in a manner only found in the American South. (The same speech sound is heard in the vowel in ""druuuunk."") Sorry. Bit of regional linguistics there.Oh -- I ought to mention wardrobe too. A fine job. They've given Blanchett exactly the right unpretentious floppy clothes that an ordinary lower-middle-class Southern widow of no sophistication might wear. Example: In one important scene, she wears this fuzzy white V-necked sweater -- angora or cashmere or something. (I don't know anything about women's clothes but I know what I like.) Underneath this sweater, though, there is a rough white T shirt that leaves a cartoon alligator's face peeping over the sweater's V neck. Exactly the proper degree of sloppiness. Yet in another scene, at a party, her hair is draped around her long face is lustrous curls and when she reaches down to remove a tight shoe we can't help noticing how sleek her ankle and her feet are, and neither can Kinnear, the guy she's with.But without Cate Blanchett's superior performance this would be no more than a routine thriller. With her, it rises rather above the routine and is worth catching.",The Gift
7,BA_Harrison,Sam Raimi's gift to ghost film fans.,9,18 March 2012,"Get a load of the talent involved in the making of The Gift: Evil Dead creator/Spiderman director Sam Raimi called the shots; Best Writing Oscar winner Billy Bob Thornton co-wrote the script; and future Oscar winning actresses Cate Blanchett and Hilary Swank led the great cast that also featured the always reliable Giovanni Ribisi, Keanu Reeves (giving one of the best performances of his career) and Katie Holmes's tits (she might not have won any Oscars, but she's the owner of a magnificent pair of Golden Globes!!!). On top of all that, regular Raimi collaborator Christopher Young provided a marvellously eerie blues-tinged score that perfectly complemented DoP Jamie Anderson's excellent atmospheric cinematography. With credentials like those, it's no big surprise that the film is such a hugely enjoyable experience.Raimi plays his horror perfectly straight for a change, brilliantly blending tense supernatural scares, emotional drama, supernatural mystery, and even courtroom drama to make The Gift one of the most mature and well-rounded films of his directorial career. The film's only weakness is that the finale is perhaps a little too predictable, the villain's identity rather easy to guess and the ghostly denouement inevitable, but with such expert handling and excellent acting throughout, this is pretty easy to overlook. In fact, The Gift is such a hauntingly effective film, it makes me wonder why Raimi bothered producing a remake of over-rated Asian horror The Grudge when he already had such a truly great ghost story under his belt.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",The Gift
8,moonspinner55,Murder-mystery/character portrait occasionally too heavy but with strong performances,7,6 January 2002,"Delicious combination murder-mystery and character portrait set in the present-day South. Widowed mother of three, who works from home as a psychic and card reader, is pulled against her will into the logistics of a popular local girl's disappearance. Although the brutality inherent in the script is laid on with a trowel by director Sam Raimi, ""The Gift"", written by Billy Bob Thornton and Tom Epperson, has some mesmerizing attributes, not the least of which is Cate Blanchett's luminous performance in the lead. The actress is sensational here; whether hesitantly giving out advice to her regulars, sympathizing with troubled mechanic Giovanni Ribisi or standing up to a surprisingly menacing Keanu Reeves, Blanchett is absolutely riveting. The plot is intricately unwound with occasionally outrageous details. It ends up being quite satisfying.",The Gift
9,dbdumonteil,the crew that made this supposedly fantastic thriller wasn't gifted at all!,4,16 September 2004,"Possible spoilers...Nowadays, psychological fantastic is a cinematographic genre that is so much successful that several film-makers (who aren't however specialized in this domain) tried their hand at it. Some of them perfectly succeeded their conversion like Adrian Lyne with ""Jacob's Ladder"" (1990) while others failed: ""What Lies Beneath"" was a disappointment in Robert Zemeckis' work. Sadly, with ""the Gift"" (2000), Sam Raimi definitely belongs to the second category. Before watching the movie I didn't expect much of it because I had already quite bad reviews about it. I was right and it isn't difficult to define the reasons why this film badly works.First, ""the Gift"" suffers from a patchy cast. If I am touched by Cate Blanchett and Hilary Swank's sensitive performances, on another hand, Sam Raimi made a mistake by hiring Keanu Reeves. He acts a violent and racist character which makes him disagreeable right away. His pitiful performance spoils the movie and you can really regret his role as Neo in ""the Matrix"" (1999).The failure of ""the Gift"" also comes from the screenplay. It was partly written by Billy Bob Thornton and it doesn't carry much weight. It consists of a thin plot that has nothing special. Sorry Mr Thornton but we have already seen the trick of the wrong culprit many times before. Furthermore, it isn't really a suspense story that Thornton designed. We can quite easily guess the person who is responsible for the murder of Jessica King from the beginning of the movie. Indeed, at this moment, Katie Holmes asks Cate Blanchett if she and her husband will have a bright future. I can't remember very well what she can see but I know it wasn't hopeful visions. Then, the same Katie Homes dates with quite numerous men in the small town. It is enough to make her husband angry. Due to this, it is very tempting to think that an important part of the film is nearly padding.It seems that Thornton did everything to leave the story a little low-key so as to leave the best in the last sequences of the film. But given that you guessed the real culprit, they fall flat. Besides, the end of the film is no good because the scriptwriters have succumbed to a fashion: to amaze the spectator by inserting a ""coup de théâtre"". But it is so hokey that it doesn't make the end of the film convincing.If he perfectly succeeds in recreating a Southern atmosphere thanks to the scenery, the landscapes, the mentality of the inhabitants and even the music, Sam Raimi fails to impose a disturbing climate. It is embarrassing for a supposedly fantastic movie. All right, there are a few frightening moments, but unfortunately too rare, they don't enable the movie to take off.Then, a quality that you could attribute to Sam Raimi is that through the years, he had found his own style without the help from Hollywood which had made him a recognizable director as the cult horror movie ""Evil Dead"" (1981) and the excellent detective movie ""A Simple Plan"" (1998) testify. Here, he gives the impression of having shooting ""the Gift"" with Hollywood presence on his back. Several passages in the film clearly show it and I will retain this one: the inevitable trial sequence.""Ultimately, ""the Gift"" is a very impersonal and disappointing movie where Raimi, once an iconoclastic film-maker lost his credibility in Hollywood mainstream. One last thing, the meeting Raimi-Thornton-Blanchett doesn't necessarily shine.",The Gift
10,blanche-2,a gem,8,29 August 2001,"It's always great to find a ""little"" film on video that you never heard of and have it turn out to be worth your while.  The Gift, with its rockin'-sock 'em cast and neat story is one of these.  The question I have is, with all the junk the studios publicize and the garbage that sits in our theaters, why don't these films get any attention?  Pearl Harbor should boast a cast like this: Cate Blanchett, Billy Bob Thornton, Hillary Swank, Greg Kinnear, Rosemary Harris, Michael Jeter, Gary Cole and Sam Raimi directing.  Give me a break. This movie is entertaining, suspenseful, warm, uplifting - and guess what, I didn't miss the special effects, bad acting or over-hype.",The Gift
11,Quinoa1984,Smart thriller definately has it's good stuff,8,19 January 2001,"(Some Spoilers)Sam Raimi made gold with Evil dead and A Simple Plan.  Now he brings The Gift, and while it doesn't match up to those films, it does do good with what it's got- fine performances from fine actors and a script co-written by William Robert (Billy Bob) Thornton.  The story has a woman who can see things, without even being there, and here 'gift' is used in a murder case involving Katie Holmes (and yes, she is nude) and who her killer might be. It has it's large share of flaws, however there are some very good performances; Cate Blanchett is good despite some overacting and Keanu Reeves and Giovanni Ribisi are simply extraordinary.  One of the better supernatural thrillers to come out recently.  A-",The Gift
12,edwagreen,***,8,2 August 2016,"Cate Blanchett was just wonderful here as the psychic, who recently lost her husband in an explosion, left with 3 children who soon becomes involved in a murder mystery.It appears obvious that town-married-hot head Keanu Reeves is the murderer and he has just gone to bed with every lady in town. Giovanni Ribisi steals his scenes as a suicide prone man, deeply disturbed who tries to set his father ablaze.Greg Kinnear is the school principal whose fiancé is murdered and that sets off the events.Blanchett is just perfect here in her seer assignment but the film may have faltered at the very end when Cate's imagination may have let it all get away from her regarding the Ribisi character.This is still a taut thriller seeing the macabre and producing a surprising murderer.",The Gift
13,Coventry,This entire cast and crew are gifted!,7,1 March 2004,"The plot of Sam Raimi's the Gift is surprisingly simple and ordinary. It actually is one of the most predictable thrillers I've seen it my life, yet there isn't one dull or annoying moment to find in the entire film. Thanks to the stylish directing skills of Sam Raimi and the multi-talented all-star cast, the Gift is brought up to a higher dimension. You forgive the plot for being weak and you accept the twists, even though you see them coming from miles away, just because it's beautifully shot and edited flawless. The film is appropriately set in a nearly forsaken town, suffering from poverty and redneck-behavior. Cate Blanchett plays a widow who takes care of her three sons all by herself. For gaining a little more money, she reads the future of several town inhabitants through cards. When the beautiful daughter of a rich businessman is missing, her father and future husband come to seek help. As said before, this main plot synopsis is inferior to the tense settings and the deep emotional character portraits. We learn that there are multiple, severely troubled minds living in this town and their stories are much more fascinating than the murder-mystery (which isn't that much of a mystery). Cate Blanchett is one of the most solid and charismatic actresses at the moment and that is stated once more, here in The Gift. She's being supported by one of the greatest casts ever, including Hillary Swank, Giovanni Ribisi, Gregg Kinear, Katie Holmes and even Keanu Reeves in his most diabolical to date. To end up a flawless cast, there are adorable little roles by J.K Simmons (as the macho policeman) and Michael Jeter (as the despicable lawyer).Sam Raimi directs The Gift very strict and manages to set a deeply depressing tone. The tempo is slow and the scares are limited, but the wholesome is pretty atmospheric and that's what counts most, I think. The most interesting aspects however, are the spooky visions and nightmarish dreams Cate Blanchett suffers from in The Gift. To me, these ghoulish sequences of morbidity are the undeniable evidence that Raimi still is a devoted horror-director in the first place. The dark shots of the lake by night and the frightening image of the fiddler portray Raimi's real capacity as a storyteller. I hope he'll return to horror soon.or at least continues to make macabre supernatural thrillers. If the complete above-written review didn't convince you to rent The Gift just yet, I might end by mentioning that the gorgeous Katie Holmes shows a lot more flesh here, then she did in 10 boring seasons of Dawson's Creek.",The Gift
14,Theo Robertson,Haunting Thriller,8,10 April 2003,"I thought THE GIFT was going to be another of those clichéd tales involving a fortune teller , but as soon as the credits revealed that the director was the underrated Sam Raimi I suddenly started hoping that this was going to be a good film and my expectations were more than satisfied.Raimi is probably best known for his SPIDERMAN blockbuster and the EVIL DEAD films , but I can't help thinking he's far better suited to human dramas like this film and A SIMPLE PLAN . Part human drama on being an outsider , part court room drama , part whodunnit and part supernatural mystery THE GIFT could have ended up as an unfocused mess but Raimi pulls it off . A word too for Raimi's handling of the cast , all the performances are very good . As you'd expect from such a talented actress Cate Blanchet is excellent , but Keannu Reeves is a shock as a redneck scum bag . I won't go so far as to say he steals the show but as a confirmed Reeves hater I found his performance totally convincing . Praise indeed In terms of pace , intelligence and characterisation Billy Bob Thornton and Tom Epperson have written a very good script , but I have one genuine complaint regarding forensics . In the court scenes evidence is presented , but there is nothing regarding forensic evidence which does lead to a fairly big plot hole . If I remember correctly A SIMPLE PLAN also suffers slightly from the screenwriter not doing his homework regarding forensics . But I suppose I can forgive this because of a haunting and touching shock twist at the end . If you've seen THE GIFT you'll know what I'm talking about , if you haven't then I won't spoil it for you . The only problem with the twist is that after you've seen it the second or third time it's not as moving or touching as it was the first time",The Gift
15,lastliberal,Messing with the devil's gonna get you burned. Everybody knows that.,6,18 April 2010,"The movie was directed by Sam Raimi and written by Billy Bob Thornton and Tom Epperson. It takes place in a small Georgia town with typical Southern characters. Cate Blanchett is Annie, a woman who supplements her social security check and earns money or goods to care for her three little boys by reading Tarot cards. She doesn't go for mumbo jumbo, she actually dispenses practical advise under the guise of a reading.The film is chock full of good and interesting actors: Giovanni Ribisi, Keanu Reeves, Katie Holmes, Greg Kinnear, Hilary Swank, Michael Jeter, and J.K. Simmons.It is good that we get to know Annie before the movie turns into a mystery. It makes everything so much more believable, if you can believe in psychic visions. Naturally, we have the usual murder mystery twists and turns. Blanchett was consistently good throughout and made the film worth watching.Was that really Katie Holmes breasts we saw?",The Gift
16,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"A little too much drama and a too little horror, but pretty good nonetheless",7,21 February 2004,"I'm normally not a big fan of Sam Raimi's work; I enjoyed Darkman to a certain extent, but hated Spiderman. Most of his other films, I've only heard about, never seen. This movie proves that he has a lot of talent; there are a lot of very psychologically horrifying sequences. The plot is very interesting, through most of the film it keeps your interest quite well. The characters are interesting and well-developed. The acting is all great, every single actor does a very good job. The atmosphere of the film is fantastic, the horror scenes were all well-made; I jumped several point throughout the scenes. The psychological terror was almost unbearable; every single sequence involving psychological terror is very disturbing. Whoever did the editing for this film obviously knows a great deal about how to affect the subconscious. The films supernatural side is very well-handled, and seems quite believable. I'd recommend this to any fan of supernatural horror, or any fan of Sam Raimi and his style. A pretty good horror movie, could have been better, but definitely worth watching for fans of the genre. 7/10",The Gift
17,ferguson-6,Swamp Thing,6,29 January 2001,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Sam Raimi seems to be trying to escape his TV background and become a player on the Hollywood scene.  Problem is, his work (""The Quick and the Dead"", ""For Love of the Game"") just shouts ""television"".  The exception was his previous collaboration with Billy Bob Thornton, who scripted ""The Gift"".  Their teaming on this one, almost works, but could have used Billy Bob in front of the camera!  Cate Blanchett is sympathetic as the blessed/cursed heroine and Keanu Reeves has the presence to pull off the bad guy role (when he's not bellowing ridiculous lines about devil worship).  The rest of cast, however, is pretty ordinary.  Greg Kinnear and Gary Cole may have actually fallen asleep during their scenes - I couldn't really tell.  My tidbit on this one is don't miss former Oingo Boingo front man and current film score composer extraordinare, Danny Elfman (yes, it's Jenna's brother) as the fiddle playing swamp man in Blanchett's dream.

18,siderite,Expected good and finally got good,8,16 July 2005,"Usually when I start watching a movie I go for the feel of it. What people said in the headers of the reviews, but not the reviews themselves, I look at the rating and the type of the film, I build a certain expectation. And usually, when I expect a movie to be good it disappoints and I find great movies that I thought would suck.This time I found a movie that is good even if I expected it to be. It is a good script, great acting, a casting packed with known and good actors, a few plot twists that make it interesting and found me and the wife wondering on who is the killer. It was... neah :) I will let you find out for yourselves.About the movie itself, it is definitely not horror. Someone at IMDb should remove that rating. It is a thriller and that about says it all. I wonder why Giovanni Ribisi always plays the role of the mentally handicapped. Is it casting? Is it a personal choice? The guy is a good actor, I have seen it and so have many others, why does he continue to play in good movies as the mentally ill character? Also Keanu Reaves... I thought that he did a good job portraying an ""insecure redneck"", but he was so out of place in such a secondary role. Same goes for Hillary Swank, playing the white trash wife. Kate Blanchett had a very good performance and, as someone else mentioned, does carry the film.There are a lot of good actors playing secondary roles in this movie. I don't know exactly why. There was almost no unfamiliar face on the screen while watching. Worth mentioning is Gary Cole, for whom I have a great deal of respect, since American Gotchic and Santa Fe. Good actor, big filmography, nobody casts him in the big roles. I can't figure out why.Getting back on the movie: it is definitely worth a watch, alone or with the SO.

21,sol-kay,"The ""Gift"" that keeps on giving",8,26 July 2005,"***SPOILERS*** Interesting murder/mystery thriller about a town psychic Annie Wilson, Cate Blanchett, who picks up vibes about an impending murder and later helps the local Brixton police find where the body of the murder victim was hidden. Annie Wilson has had this gift of psychic perception since she was a little girl and it was passed down to her by her grandmother, Rosemary Harris.Early in the movie we see grandma materialize out of thin air as a startled Annie, who's hanging up her laundry,watches which is he first explanation to how she has these paranormal powers. At a social event in town one evening Annie meets her children's school principal Wayne Collins and his fiancée Jessica King, Greg Kinnear & Katie Holmes. Earlier Annie met the two at Wayne's office about her son Mike, Lynnsee Provence, who was having trouble at school and had a disturbing perception about what the future holds for them. Later Annie came across Jessica secretly making out with one of the persons at the party who turned out to be none other then the towns district attorney David Duncon,Gary Cole.With what Jessica was doing behind Wayne's back being none of her business Annie kept quiet about what she saw until the next day when Jessica was reported missing by Wayne to the police. It turned out that Annie, unknowingly, picked up what happened to Jessica in a nightmare that she had that very night after the party. Being widowed with her husband killed in a industrial accident Annie supported herself and her three young children by giving reading with cards,that she made up,to supplement the meager monthly social security check she got from the government. The only way that her psychic gift could work is that she didn't require a fee from those who sought out her services and only took graduates or tips from her many customers in and around town. Picking up images of Jussica floating in some body of water Annie felt that she's dead and at the bottom of one of the many lakes and ponds in and around Brixton. The towns police chief Pearl Johnson, J.K Simmions, who at first felt that Annie was some kind of kook but as a last resort followed up her leads and sure enough Jussica's body was found in a lake on Donnie Braksdale's, Keanu Reeves, property. It turned that Donnie was not only abusing his wife Valerie, Hilary Swank, but was having an affair with Jessica who seemed to be having an affair with every man in town.The fact that Donnie belted Jessica, almost knocking her out cold, the night of her disappearance made him the #1 suspect in her murder.Being persecuted by state's D.A Duncan the case against Donnie is open and shut with him being convicted for Jussica's murder.With everything taken care of by the court and with Donnie Braksdale safely behind bars Annie realizes that Donnie, even though he's a brutal and vicious thug, didn't murder Jessica; even worse Jessica murderer is still out there and that she, knowing that the wrong person is behind bars for Jessica's murder, may very well be his next victim.Becides Annie local garage mechanic Buddy Cole, Glovanni Ribisi,also seems to have psychic powers that stemmed from, of all things, the sexual abuse he received from his father when he was a little boy. It was Buddy, at the end of the movie, who was somehow able to come back from beyond to save Annie's life from Jessica's killer and it may have been that psychic connection between the two that attracted them so much to each other.""The Gift"" is a well structured film that even though it's central theme is about the supernatural comes across like a very good murder mystery more then anything else.",The Gift
22,paul2001sw-1,Dull visions,5,27 November 2005,"Some films featuring supernatural happenings are intentionally silly; others unintentionally so. But some films take their supernaturality very seriously indeed, and 'The Gift' is one such example. The story of a psychic who gets intuitions of a murder, it actually maintains a pretence of plausibility throughout; but only at the price of unbroken solemnity, and ultimately, boredom for the viewer. Director Sam Raimi takes a lot of shots of Cate Blanchett's interesting face; but there's not a lot else to this film beyond Blanchett looking troubled, and a stylised portrayal of the American deep south. This movie is not awful, but it is a little dull.",The Gift
23,atlasmb,Cate Blanchett Disappears Into Her Character,7,28 June 2017,"Cate Blanchett plays Annie Wilson, a southern widow with three sons who is just scraping by financially. She does psychic readings to supplement her Social Security benefits. Some of her visions are thrust upon her, rather than sought after. And some of them are gruesome. The gift is also a curse.Blanchett's ethereal beauty somehow never gets in the way of this story about the modest and retiring Annie. And neither does the accent she must effect. Her fine performance is the center of this drama that involves a battered wife (Katie Holmes) and her threatening husband (Keanu Reeves). The rest of the cast, including Giovanni Ribisi, Greg Kinnear, Hilary Swank, Michael Jeter and J.K. Simmons, is formidable.The plot evolves into a murder mystery, then a trial drama, until the final act reveals the truth about an unfortunate night.Most of the characters in this film are dysfunctional or damaged. The story is co-written by Billy Bob Thornton, who certainly knows his way around southern Gothic, redneck drama. With such well-developed characters and setting, this is a film that could support a number of sequels.",The Gift

In addition, we have Sam's team on the board as well with « aunt May », « JJJ », « sheriff Lucas Buck » and the famous yellow Oldsmobile. It's a pity that we don't have the usual cameos of Sam himself, his brother or Campbell ! It's also a great thing to find a story in a small town, with « ordinary » people having simple life as ours. I expected Sam to be more dynamic and on the contrary, the movie is as quiet as lying water. But as the main hero isn't Darkman or Spiderman but a widower mother of three boys, he was inspired to choose this pace: it really fits the Cate's compassion and maternal instinct, all the more than as told in the movie, she is really the heart of the town ! And for sure this wild nature with swamps and torn trees are as much frightening as any other supernatural monsters !",The Gift
26,Anonymous_Maxine,Much creepier than I expected!,9,11 March 2008,"The Gift comes on the heels of The Watcher, another relatively lesser known thriller in which Keanu Reeves plays a bad guy surprisingly well. The Gift is the much better of the two, and for obvious reasons, given the astonishing level of talent involved. Everyone is in this movie! Cate Blanchette, Giovanni Ribisi, one of our most versatile actors, Reeves, Greg Kinnear, Hillary Swank, Michael Jeter  and it's directed by Sam Raimi! It amazes me that this movie is not more famous, because this is one of the best teams I've seen assembled all at once in years.This movie, despite the surpernatural content, has a much more realistic approach than The Watcher, which was really just your standard by the numbers thriller. Granted, there is not much subtlety in the characterization (especially with Donnie!), but Sam Raini has never really been known for his subtlety. Reeves plays the role of Donnie Barksdale, the abusive husband of Valerie Barksdale (Hillary Swank), who comes under suspicion when a dead body is dredged up in the pond behind his house. This is the makings for a boring murder mystery, but the tangled web that is weaved among the striking number of three dimensional characters is brilliant in its complexity and (as is usually the case when a murder mystery goes for this level of complexity and depth), none of the scenes or occurrences or revelations of evidence ever seem contrived or tacked on. For a movie with such a supernatural element, it has an amazingly real world feel.Cate Blanchette plays Annie Wilson, a local mystic who makes a meager income telling fortunes, or whatever you would like to call it, mostly to local friends, many of whom receive her tellings for free. Wilson's husband had been killed some time before, casting doubt on her true ability to see the fortunes or misfortunes of others before they happen. Soon she has a vision of a woman's murdered body Jessica King, played by Katie Holmes) having been dumped in a lake, which turns out to be the lake behind Donnie's house.The movie spends a lot of the first half establishing how viciously abusive Donnie is to his wife. She shows up at Wilson's house asking for help, but refuses to leave Donnie. She's afraid, as abused women so often are, to leave him, because she is sure that he'll kill her. And judging by the extent of her bruises and injuries, it doesn't seem like a stretch. Needless to say, Donnie forbids Valerie from seeing Wilson because he's sure she's involved in some kind of witchcraft. Similarly, his defense attorney has a field day with her story about her vision of Jessica's body in his lake. She becomes the one weak link in an otherwise airtight prosecution.Interestingly, there is something to be said about human nature, as it is difficult not to sympathize with Donnie, even after all of the terrible things that he said and did during the film, when he is on the stand, admitting that he is an abusive husband and acknowledging how wrong it is. The entire courtroom scene is outstanding, you can literally feel the tension in the air. Imagine how terrified Valerie must have been!! It's good to see such a well-made courtroom scene, since it's the most important part of the movie. Then again, the rest of the law enforcement content of the movie is botched pretty badly. Donnie gut-punches Annie Wilson right in front of the Sheriff when they're searching his lake. No one seems to mind, even though everyone had a right to be there, even the police, yet they do nothing. There is also the unexpected addition of the fact that Valerie WANTS To forgive Donnie, because he had been having an affair with Jessica King, and she thinks she deserved what she got. It's an interesting analysis of the bizarre mentality that some abused women have. I can never understand why women stay with abusive husbands. It always seems to me that they would be embarrassed to still be married to a man who beats them, but apparently their fear outweighs that. Here, she forgives Donnie for cheating, but not the woman he cheated with, even if he was the one that killed her. The story involving Buddy Cole (Ribisi) is wonderfully acted, as always, and satisfying in that we get to see something that, I think, we sometimes wish more people could experience, the abused son getting back at his father as an adult. I think this almost never happens, because while abused children tend to hang on to that anger for the rest of their lives, they also hang onto their fear, so revenge stories like this are remarkably hard to come by. I'm no expert, of course. Just thinking out loud. The end of the film is great, even though it ends with the hint of a small cliché about the senselessness of violence (You think you know someone), but can I just say one thing? The music that comes on when Cole rescues Wilson at the end of the movie at the lake, for the first second or two, sounds almost exactly like the beginning of the Back to the Future overture. Maybe it was just me. The movie also, by the way, contains what might be the creepiest fiddle playing I've ever seen.At any rate, this in an outstanding accomplishment for everyone involved. Highly recommended!",The Gift

28,Turfseer,Highly entertaining supernatural murder mystery with Cate Blanchett as both admired and vilified small town psychic,8,20 July 2021,"Before the success he had with Sling Blade, Billy Bob Thornton was one of the impressive co-writers of The Gift. What's so cool about this supernatural thriller is that it's set in the real modern day Southern town of Brixton, Georgia. A top-notch cast has been assembled with Cate Blanchett as Annie Wilson, the town ""psychic"" who supplements her social security survivor benefits income by performing psychic readings (some in the town derisively refer to Annie as a ""fortune teller""). Annie is more of a counselor who uses her enhanced intuition to advise those locals who come to her for advice. Annie also has her share of heartache as her husband was killed in a workplace explosion a year earlier, leaving her to care for three young sons.The break into Act II occurs when Annie advises domestic abuse victim Valerie Barksdale (Hillary Swank) to leave her abusive husband Donnie (a very convincing, menacing Keanu Reeves) who ends up threatening Annie in front of her kids. The film scenarists do very well in depicting the psychology of domestic abuse victims such as the conflicted Valerie, who in the end expresses fear of leaving Donnie despite the long history of abuse.Donnie represents the reactionary element in American society; he treats anyone who's a little different or an outsider as a scapegoat. Here he vilifies Annie as a devil worshipper but is not averse to threatening her, utilizing a little supernatural belief of his own-in the form of a voodoo doll!In addition Annie has been helping Buddy Cole (Giovanni Ribisi), a gas station attendant, who suffers from mental illness due to being subjected to abuse by his father when he was a child. After Annie becomes preoccupied with the events we will describe in a moment, she is forced to neglect Buddy who decompensates completely, ties up his father in front of both his mother and Annie, pours gasoline on him and sets him on fire. Buddy is so unstable because--as the film scenarists make it clear--he was sexually abused as a child, and he is promptly institutionalized.The plot intensifies when Annie is introduced to one of her sons' school principal Wayne Collins (Greg Collins), after the son gets into a fight at school. On the surface Wayne seems like a straight arrow but one wonders why he's so attracted to his promiscuous girlfriend Jessica King (Katie Holmes). When she disappears and appears to be a victim of foul play, the police, after exhausting all leads, turn to Annie for clues to her disappearance.J. K. Simmons as Sheriff Peal Johnson is perfect as the skeptical lawman who doesn't believe in Annie's psychic intuition at first but later becomes convinced of her abilities when she has visions of a murdered Jessica and eventually points to a pond on Donnie's property where the body is located.Annie's initial intuition was that Donnie was an ""insecure redneck"" but not capable of murder. What's really interesting is that after being arrested and put on trial for murdering Jessica, he appears to testify truthfully, honestly admitting that he cheated on his wife with Jessica and was guilty of domestic violence. Nonetheless when things turn against him and he's found guilty of Jessica's murder, he again reverts to blaming Annie, once again calling her an agent of the devil.Despite the gossipy nature of the small town denizens, one can't help but wonder that given the wholly circumstantial case against Donnie, if in real life he would have been convicted of the murder. Annie of course never said he was guilty, only locating the body through her dark visions. One wonders why it never occurred to her that Donnie was innocent earlier but given her antipathy toward him, perhaps his actions caused her to dislike him so much that it interfered with her intuition as to his guilt.Eventually Annie does have visions suggesting that Donnie is innocent, which moves her to ask the District Attorney to reopen the case. To further complicate things, earlier Annie observed that the DA was also romantically involved with the murder victim and she uses that against him, demanding that he reopen the case.The Gift's climax is wholly satisfying as there is a twist ending! It turns out the real murderer is Wayne who lures Annie to the spot where Jessica's body was found. He now wants to know if her psychic powers have revealed him as the murderer. When he realizes that Annie does in fact know, he's on the verge of murdering her too, only to be stopped and prevented by Buddy, who appears out of nowhere.At this point we're thinking that Buddy escaping from the mental hospital and trailing Annie and Wayne to the pond is highly unlikely. When Annie drives back and delivers an unconscious Wayne to the police, Buddy disappears. The twist occurs when Sheriff Johnson reveals that Buddy couldn't have aided Annie, since he had hung himself hours before back at the state mental hospital. One can only surmise that it was Buddy's spirit however who was there to assist Annie in overpowering Wayne.Blanchett is excellent effecting a Southern accent and presenting the quiet dignity of a woman both admired and vilified in her home town. Ribisi also stands out as the mentally ill Buddy. Despite the implausibility of the trial, I found The Gift to be highly entertaining as well as admiring the direction of Sam Raimi, who puts everything together so neatly (including the effective homespun musical score).",The Gift

34,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"great cast, interesting story",7,4 December 2016,"Anyone who loves a good slice of southern Gothic murder mystery should check out Sam Raimi's The Gift, one of several films in the eclectic scoundrel's ouvre which made a departure from his usual brand of chaotic horror. Cate Blanchett stars as Annabelle, a single mother with a very perceptive telepathic ability, which in rural USA is greeted without any skepticism by the locals. She is renowned for her gift, and often approached by people in need. The story sees her trying to locate young Jessica (Katie Holmes), who has gone missing, and discovering some nasty secrets about the people around her in the process, people she thought she knew better. Jessica's fiancé (Greg Kinnear) is desperate but clearly knows something he's not saying. Also involved is battered housewife Valerie (Hilary Swank), her terrifying abusive boyfriend Donnie (Keanu Reeves), a local mechanic (Giovanni Ribisi) who befriends Annabelle, and others. It's an ugly tale contrasted by Blanchett's striking beauty, which the cameras capture in all the right instances. She could be rearranging a bookshelf and still be compelling and elegant, and always is in whichever role she takes on. Reeves is a scary tornado of pent up rage and sickness, cast way against type and loving every rage fuelled second. As if the main cast wasn't packed enough with talent, we also get stellar work from Gary Cole, Michael Jeter, Kim Dickens, Rosemary Harris, a random cameo from Danny Elfman and a sly turn from J.K. Simmons as the county sheriff. What a cast, eh? Raimi puts them to good use, and each one gets their moment to shine. I've never seen a film by the director I haven't loved; the guy just makes super fun, accessible genre treats that are irresistibly likable. Pair that with the evocative southern tone and Blanchett's winning presence and you've got one hell of a little package. Very overlooked stuff.",The Gift
35,drownnnsoda,Spooky And Atmospheric Thriller.,9,11 June 2007,"""The Gift"" centers around a small southern American town and it's residents, one of whom is Annie Wilson (Oscar winner Cate Blanchett), a single mother who makes her money under the table by giving readings using a special psychic power that she inherited from her grandmother. Between Valerie Barksdale (Oscar winner Hilary Swank), an abused woman with a vicious husband, Donnie (Keanu Reeves), and the other town residents, Annie makes pretty decent money to support herself and her three sons. But she soon finds herself entangled in a mystery involving the daughter of a prominent town citizen, Jessica King (Katie Holmes), who has seemed to vanish into thin air. Her worried fiancée, Wayne (Greg Kinnear) comes to Annie for help, resulting in a slew of disturbing visions involving Jessica's vanishing. Soon Annie is asked to use her ""gift"" to try and help the police solve a disappearance, which soon turns into a murder...I saw ""The Gift"" quite a few years ago, and it had a lasting impression on me. Directed by Sam Raimi, who earned his place in the horror hall of fame for the cult classic ""Evil Dead"" series, this is quite a spooky little mystery film. I haven't seen too many films that center on psychics or this type of psychic phenomena, so in that aspect the story is a nice take on something fairly refreshing and new. The script is strong and the characters are well developed, which is an important factor to this film's success. The audience gets to know the characters well, and each of their stories are told appropriately throughout the course of the movie. While it may not be a 'horror' film per se, there are quite a few delightfully creepy moments in this film, among them being the visions Annie has of Jessica, and the terrifying fiddler in the swamp sequence that gave me a good dose of the creeps for quite a while after viewing the film - this was definitely one of the creepiest moments of the movie.One of the strongest points of the film though is it's stellar cast, led by the talented Cate Blanchett, who turns in a near flawless performance as a troubled widow who is trying to cope with visions of a horrific crime and the repercussions of her special gift. Giovanni Ribisi plays a drunken mechanic, one of the few people Annie fully understands, and Hilary Swank and Keanu Reeves portray a couple in an abusive relationship very realistically. Greg Kinnear plays Wayne, a friendly, southern-gentleman-type school teacher, and Katie Holmes plays his fiancée, the prominent and wealthy Jessica. The performances here are powerful and overall stunning, this film managed to gain an amazing line-up of some talented performers. Overall, ""The Gift"" is a superior supernatural thriller that grabs you by the throat and pulls you right into the mystery, never relenting until the surprising conclusion. Stellar performances, excellent story, nice cinematography and atmosphere all make this a far above-average supernatural film that I'd recommend to anyone who would like to watch a quality, involving suspense-mystery. Excellent movie. 9/10.",The Gift

I was in a town on the southernmost tip of Chile when I first saw this movie in a hotel room which just happen to have HBO. Not even the outside splendor of a midnight sun could tear me away from watching the movie on the TV set back then.Co-written by Billy Bob Thornton (upon whose mother's psychic gifts the story is based) and Tom Epperson, the plot revolves around the disappearance of Jessica Starlet, the daughter of a wealthy resident of a Georgia backwater town. Tired of blind alleys, the police begrudgingly recruit Annie Wilson, a single mother of three sons, who lost her husband in a factory accident and now has to earn a living as a tarot reading psychic/fortune teller. Annie thinks she finds a suspect in Donnie Barksdale, the abusive, white-trash husband of one of her most devoted customers, Valerie. Complicating matters for Annie is her attraction to Wayne Collins, her eldest son's teacher and Jessica's fiancée; and Buddy Cole, another of Annie's customers, a suicidal mechanic traumatized by the parental abuse he received as a child.While it's not perfectly constructed, the sometimes excessive screenplay contains a lot of layers but remains true to the characters' voices and motivations throughout. Raimi's expert direction is full of sumptuous Southern Gothic visuals and genuine tension that escalates over the course of the story. Credit needs to be given to Jamie Anderson's cinematography and Neil Spisak's production design for establishing such a heady atmosphere perfect for the labyrinth plot. Some of the actors really surprised me with strong turns, including Katie Holmes as the spoiled, baby-faced débutante Jessica; Greg Kinnear as the seemingly stalwart Wayne; Keanu Reeves especially visceral and chilling as unrepentant wife-beater Donnie; and Giovanni Ribisi as the deeply troubled Buddy.In the smallish role of Valerie, Hilary Swank makes her moments count as she cringes from Donnie's scarifying dominance over her. But it's the wondrous Cate Blanchett who pulls it all together with her multi-dimensional performance as Annie. With a convincing Southern accent, she reveals the hidden layers of her character beautifully as she tries to recover from the loss of her husband, protect her children and make sense of the psychic revelations that traumatize her and us. The DVD is short on extras - a fifteen-minute featurette which includes cast and crew interviews, the movie's trailer and a video of Neko Case's ""Furniture Room Lullaby"" which perfectly reflects the haunting soundtrack. Definitely seek this one out if you are looking for an atmospheric, character-driven thriller that does not condescend to the viewer.",The Gift

It's as if the no-longer-a-cult-director-now-a-Hollywood-fixture Sam Raimi decided to assemble a killer cast to wrestle a half-baked script into something hopefully meaningful, and at that he only half-succeeds. Except for Greg Kinnear (whose Southern drawl only appears when he wants it to, apparently), the cast is excellent--the classy, intelligent Cate Blanchett gives another fine performance; Keanu Reeves is shockingly good as an abusive redneck (perhaps the best and only ""acting"" he's done in his entire career).

40,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Really Good Cast and an Interesting Murder Mystery from Sam Raimi,8,2 October 2020,"This was a movie that I'm pretty shocked I didn't more about. I've seen the images of Katie Holmes topless from it, mostly because I would have been at peak adolescence with the internet and her being Katie Holmes. I'm also a Sam Raimi fan, who is the director. For whatever reason, this movie avoided me. I did hear a podcast talk about this before showing a movie at the Gateway Film Center and that intrigued me, but it wasn't until The Podcast Under the Stairs' Summer Challenge Series for the 2000s that I finally gave it a go. The synopsis here is a fortune teller with extrasensory perception is asked to help find a young woman who has mysteriously disappeared.For this movie, we're following Annie Wilson (Cate Blanchett). She is a widowed mother to three boys. Her husband died tragically in a fire at his work. At the moment, she is living off social security as well as donations for reading people's fortunes. One of her clients is Valerie Barksdale (Hilary Swank). We see that someone is beating her up and we learn it is her husband Donnie. Despite the warnings she is getting from Annie, she can't leave him.Annie is trying to get by with what little she has, including the help from a local mechanic Buddy Cole (Giovanni Ribisi). We can see there are some issues there as he breaks down trying to give Annie a ride home. There are repressed memories there that cause him to have violent outburst. Also with outbursts, Annie has to go to school for her eldest son Mike (Lynnsee Provence). He's harboring a lot of rage about what happened to his father. It is there we meet Wayne Collins (Greg Kinnear) who I believe is the principal as well as his fiancé, Jessica King (Holmes).Things take a turn for Annie when Donnie (Keanu Reeves) comes to her place and threatens her as well as her children. If she doesn't stay away from his wife, he's going to hurt them. Valerie comes to apologize, which escalates the issues even more. Living in a small town though doesn't help her as the police don't believe that Donnie is capable of what Annie believes.The town is rocked when Jessica goes missing. Annie starts getting visions of what could have happened to her and this brings Wayne, Jessica's father Kenneth (Chelcie Ross) along with the sheriff Pearl Johnson (J.K. Simmons). Under pressure, she can't pick up any clues, but she has a dream that points her in the direction of Donnie. He claims he was framed and Jessica was seeing more than just him. The truth of what happened is darker than we first believe.That's where I want to leave this recap and I have to say, this movie really does play very well as a dark, supernatural murder mystery film. This does seem like the natural progression of movies would got in the 1990's where murder mysteries were the thing and I think that Raimi did a really good job at taking this into the horror genre while still keeping the depths of the characters.First I really need to speak about Annie. I think it is an interesting setting to have this placed in what I'm assuming is Louisiana. There is the rich history of voodoo, which Annie is claiming to follow, but really doesn't. She uses these special cards that help guide her to know things she shouldn't. While Donnie is threatening her, he calls her a witch, that she is worshipping Satan and states he will use a voodoo doll on her. She is really just a tragic character. Blanchett does an amazing job here and I come to expect that. I've never seen her in a bad role. She just is trying to make ends meet with her meager life while raising her children alone and helping those around her when she can.Next I want to shift it to Donnie. I was shocked to see Reeves playing this character, but he does it so well. I'm not always the biggest fan of him as he is hit or miss a lot with roles. I thought fort his one it is on the better side of his performances. It plays this 'insecure redneck' so well, where it feels like if John Wick had no morals and is just a bully. I was quite impressed with him as a villain in this movie.From here I want to take it to the depth of this story. I've already said my piece on Annie. She has a crush on Wayne, but still is loyal to her dead husband which I commend. She is the only friend to Buddy and his whole story line is sad. Annie isn't dedicating the time that he needs and he's not actually seeking real treatment for the trauma he endured as a child. It really is heartbreaking to be honest. To bring this back to Wayne, he seems like a good guy. He is engaged to the most beautiful young woman in town in Jessica. She's quite wild though and I think a lot of this is growing up with money. She is able to get away with things. I don't think she should be killed for that, as I don't like what she is doing behind Wayne's back. She needed to be an adult and be who she is without the façade that she needs to keep up.There is something in this movie that I don't always like and that is the dream sequence. I'm forgiving here though. Annie has visions which help her to know the things that she does. What I like for this movie is that it blurs lines. We get a longer one where she is visited by her grandmother, Rosemary Harris, which actually sets the stage for something later in the movie.That will take me next to the acting where I'll just briefly go over the ones I haven't yet. Ribisi was really good in this broken character he takes on. He's another actor that I'm sad to see he doesn't do more, but he does a really good job in the smaller role he has here. Holmes doesn't have a large role either, but I like her as this Southern woman with a wild side. Plus, seeing her topless in her underwear doesn't hurt. Kinnear is solid as well as Swank, Gary Cole and Simmons with shout-outs in their bit parts to Michael Jeter, Kim Dickens, Ross and Harris.The last thing that I really wanted to go over would be the effects. This movie doesn't have a lot of them, but it also doesn't need them. I did like that they play with the look of the frame. There is times when we know it is a dream sequence, while others are blurred which works for me. Aside from that, I thought the make-up for Jessica when she is dead was solid. It is pretty creepy as well. Other than that, the cinematography was solid and I had no issues there.With that said, I'm glad that I finally got a chance to see this movie. It is an interesting murder mystery with a supernatural element. The interesting story with its twists and turns is aided by how strong of a cast that we have here. While watching the credits, I was shocked as seeing the cast we had here. This explores some flawed characters and I think that helps to question things we are seeing. Overall I would say this movie is a good movie and one that I would like to see again now that I know how it ends.",The Gift
41,Samiam3,Spooky Good.,8,25 April 2010,"There's something very psychologically and occasionally literally unhealthy about the south- eastern United States, which when crafted correctly can make a very moody picture, John boorman knew this when he adapted deliverance, but if you want a scary motion picture try the gift. Appropriatelly subtle, well acted, well shot and specifically well scored, with the the line between sound effect and music virtually disappearing (as is typical of all Sam Raimi films)Set in the town of Brixton (Louisiana I think), Annie Wilson, recently widowed with three kids is the town fortune teller. The police department turn to her visions for help when the daughter of a wealthy businessman disappears. As things start to heat up, Annies visions turn into nightmares, and she suspects foul play. She could be in danger herself for all she knows, considering the town does not like what she is doing.I like the rhythm of the film, no too slow, not too fast, there are definitely forces at work building up towards something. Depending on how hooked you are however, that 'something' may or may not disappoint. The third act is a bit contrived, and anti-climactic, which a twist that sort of becomes evident quickly. There are numerous characters in the story, some of which are left unattended for, but not that it does any real harm.I wouldn't call The Gift a ghost story, but it certainly feels like one. When the Ring came out two years later, many critics called it the scariest ghost story of the decade, (until last years Paranormal activity). Frankly I think this is the film, that Gore Verbinski's mediocre Japanese Remake could've been. The Gift is a descent time investment, for the spook fans.",The Gift
42,triple8,intense mystery I should have enjoyed more then I did.,6,15 September 2006,"SPOILERS THROUGH:I found The Gift to be very intense and very involving but not really very enjoyable. It isn't a bad movie but probably not one I would watch again. But on the whole, this movie, which was recommended by several of my friends, wasn't much above average for me.There were several things I liked about it. One was the atmosphere. This is a genuine southern Gothic who done it film and the movie was positively DRENCHED in atmosphere. The moodiness was spot on and I like movies that take place in the south so I appreciated that. The Gift is a movie that knows a lot of the appeal in movies is getting the atmosphere right and that was evident here.Another positive was the genuine who done it aspect. There are many suspects to choose from and the movie manages to keep one guessing throughout. One really does, constantly, go through all the possibilities. Could it be this one? That one? The list of suspects is plentiful and at least for me, it really did have me changing my mind moment to moment about who I thought did it.Then there's the acting. Everyone here put in a good performance and the cast was really really good. Keanu reeves in particular I must mention as I did not even realize it was him at first. So that's a definite positive. There are several really good things about The Gift and that's why I gave it a 6. The movie's intense too and at the end of it I Just thought wow. It definitely couldn't be called boring.But there were some negatives too. There is such a thing as a movie being to intense. This movie was one of the gloomiest I've seen in awhile as well being very emotionally brutal. I definitely would not recommend it for children or people who have a difficult time with violence in movies. I'm usually OK with that stuff but did have difficulty here. Part of the problem was the dark aspect. There wasn't one light moment in the whole film and although it is, essentially, a mystery I think the movie would have been easier to watch if it had been a little less brutal and a little lighter.There were also numerous sub plots that I guess did help bring the story together but it did seem at times that the movie had to much going on. And at times it seemed to be straying away from being a mystery/drama and getting into thriller territory and I think the movie was at it's best when it did not do that.And then there's the fact that very few of the characters were very likable. That was frustrating. And many were very one dimensional. The movie also jumped so quickly from the discovery of the victim to the trial. I felt it didn't flow wonderfully either.The actual revelation of who did it wasn't as intense as it should have been either and I was disappointed that it went the route of the fiancée. (to predictable.) It would have been more of a shocker to have it be Swank's character or if the movie really wanted to be unpredictable have it be Keanu after all. Anyway....Basically this is a movie I really did not like very much but that I can see had some really good aspects to it. I was disappointed at the end but would give it high marks for atmosphere, and doubly high marks for all the performances. My vote's 6 of 10.",The Gift
43,Sherazade,Not as bad as it was panned!,8,12 May 2006,"The marquee for this film reads like a who is who of Hollywood elite, and that can be distracting for a film that had so much potential. They really didn't need to fill out the cast with celebrities. Any good actor would have done fine, provided that they left Cate Blanchett in the brilliant role of Psychic mama Annie Wilson.Annie is a single-mother who puts bread on the table by reading tarot cards for the locals who live in her small sleepy southern American town. She secretly has a soft spot for a guy named Wayne (played by Greg Kinnear) who is engaged to the Mayor's daughter Jessica (played by Katie Holmes in her Pre-Tomkat days). You see what I'm saying? Nearly every character is a major film star. But anyways, while juggling a tempestuous friendship with a mentally challenged mechanic Buddy (played by Giovanni Ribisi), Annie must also watch out for Donnie Barksdale (played by Keanu Reeves) the psychotic husband of Valerie Barksdale (played by Hilary Swank) who is against his wife's friendship and patronage of Annie.One day, while out at a function honoring the Mayor, Annie spies Jessica (Holmes's character) having sex with a man that is not her fiancé in the restroom but keeps this to herself. Later that night, when she (Annie) returns home, she has a nightmare about a dead girl who seems to be trying to tell her something. The next morning, word starts spreading that Jessica King has disappeared. Convinced that she can help, Annie lends a hand with her tarot cards but this causes her more grief than relief. Eventually, she leads them to a river where she instructs the search party to search the bottom of the lake and there they find King's body. The story now becomes a whodunit, and the race to save Annie's life as the killer seems to be after her as well.There is a Bollywood version of the film entitled Rakht, starring Bipasha Basu in the Cate Blanchett role, Sanjay Dutt in the Greg Kinear role, Dino Morea in the Keanu Reeves role among others.",The Gift
44,eric262003,A Thriller Without the Clichés,8,17 November 2008,"If you're fed up with going to the theater, listening to annoying chit-chat in the background, mindless conversations you hear on cell phones, going through the painstaking procedure of pushing your way through the masses of screaming, naval-exposing teens or big, heavy-set individuals who supply themselves enough food to feed Calgary for a month, then you're in luck. Just follow my lead as I take you on a journey to a section of the theater, to a movie where everyone sits still. A movie that will likely grab everyone's attention 100% along the way with no hassles or interruptions. My suggestion is to see ""The Gift"". Though it may be too old to be in theaters, it's still a great film to rent or buy and shouldn't be overlooked.When it was released in theaters in early 2001, it didn't draw big bucks at the box office, but was praised by the critics and the wonderful direction of Sam Raimi (""One False Move""). Of course those who love watching something blow up, will most likely say that it's not worth your time or money and to avoid it at all costs. In ""The Gift"", there are no explosions. And it has nothing to do with that last minute trip to Walmart's to find that present for your cantankerous boss. What ""The Gift"" has for us is a terrific cast of talented performers, creepy scenarios, psychologically unstable nightmares, and a mystery that will blow your mind. As a treat for all those who hate Katie Holmes, she dies in this movie (at least her character that is). And Keanu Reeves will steal the ladies' hearts and every scene he's in the wife-beating redneck in one of his more natural performance he's ever been in.The setting of this movie couldn't be any creepier than the marshlands of Georgia, where a local woman named Annie Wilson (Cate Blanchett) has a tremendous gift. Her husband was killed in a horrible accident, leaving her behind raising two boys on her own. Her income comes from her self-employed profession as a clairvoyant who can read predictions and listen to her clients' problems. When the local sexpot Jessica King (Katie Holmes) is nowhere to be found, the town depends on Annie track track down clues that lead to her disappearance. The investigation lead to a compelling array of mind-numbing suspense and unpredictable terror.Since this film is part of the thriller genre, it could've easily been a stinker. But we have director Raimi to thank for his outstanding direction, the acting by the cast is truly believable with very little stereotypes, and the location to where it's set is creepy enough to freak you out. Nothing clichéd about this movie. The supporting actors portrayed are at most excellent including Keanu Reeves, Giovanni Ribisi and Greg Kinnear, but Austrailian actress Cate Blanchett was the real star of this movie. Putting on a wonderful Southern accent, she takes great pride in helping those around her with her psychic abilities, she provides both the heart and the soul of the movie.",The Gift
45,philip_vanderveken,"Well-crafted, a nice and mysterious story line and some good acting",8,22 June 2005,"Sam Raimi certainly isn't an unknown producer and director for the people who like horror movies. Movies like ""The Evil Death"", ""Boogeyman"", ""The Grudge"",... are famous among them. But even the rest of the general public will know him since he made the spectacular ""Spider-man"" and ""Spider-man 2"" films. With this movie he has done a rather different project. Sure, you could call it a horror movie too, but personally I rather like to see it as a mysterious thriller.When a local young woman disappears and the police can't find any leads, her father, a prominent citizen in the town, consults Annie. Annie is a widow with three young sons and a gift. She's clairvoyant and supports her family by reading cards. Slowly she starts having visions of the woman chained and in a pond owned by Donnie Barksdale, the abusive husband of a client, and with her visions she is able to lead the police to the body. Donnie is arrested and convicted but her visions about the murder don't end. What if Donnie is innocent, what if he has only been thrown in jail because of her visions and the real killer is still running around somewhere ... free? What I don't really understand is why this movie gets a rather low rating right now (an average of 6.8/10 after 12,786 votes), because this is actually a well-crafted thriller with the right atmosphere and some good acting. The cast is a good mix of famous and not so well-known actors and it really works well. My personal favorite is Keanu Reeves. I find him excellent in his role as the aggressive redneck Donnie Barksdale, but the other actors and actresses are sure nice to watch as well. Overall this is a movie that I would recommend to all people who like a well-written mysterious thriller. The acting and the story are nice and Sam Raimi has directed it all very well.

51,mattymatt4ever,"A compelling, genuinely intriguing, very well-acted mystery/thriller",7,7 June 2002,"Cate Blanchett's performance alone make this solid thriller worth watching. I saw her in this movie, and I became baffled as to why she wasn't considered for an Oscar nomination.  She carries this film on her shoulders, and never once budges.  Not only does she totally get rid of her Australian accent and perfectly don a Southern accent, but she gives a deep, powerful performance as the innocent widow, Annie Wilson, who is looked down by many in her community but simply wants to share her psychic gifts with her willing clients.  Blanchett communicates great emotion with a simple facial expression.Of course, I also have to give it up for the multi-talented supporting cast. Though most of them, with the exception of Hilary Swank, couldn't really nail down the Southern accent, they are absolutely terrific.  The only actor I felt was miscast was Katie Holmes.  Not only is her accent phony and over-the-top, but she just seems too young and innocent for the role. Giovanni Ribisi, on the other hand, is a revelation.  I knew, ever since his breakthrough performance in ""Suburbia,"" that he had great promise as an up-and-coming actor, but in ""The Gift"" he delivers his most powerful performance up-to-date.  I would even argue that he deserved an Oscar nod. He constantly stirs up sympathy in his audience, despite his mental instability and momentary outbursts of anger.  I was also extremely impressed with Keanu Reeves, who delivers a genuinely haunting performance. It's times like this where I just can't fathom why many people still insist on picking on Keanu, regarding him as dull and cardboard.  Personally, I thought he was great ever since his emotional performance in ""Permanent Record.""  But he better demonstrates his versatility as an actor as the abusive Donny.  He made his debut, as a villain, in the throwaway thriller ""The Watcher,"" but I found him much more haunting in this role.  Plus, he sports a rugged look, totally shedding his pretty-boy image.  Greg Kinnear is good and subtle, and Hilary Swank continues to flaunt her brilliant acting abilities as the vulnerable wife of Donny who constantly takes beatings from him, yet still maintains her love for him.The story is very intriguing, revolving around a cast of colorful characters.  This isn't a ""scary"" movie as it somewhat looks in the previews, but it is full of mystery and thrills, without cheaply going for shock value.  There is a nifty twist at the end, which is credible and not thrown from left field, but the plot isn't packed with surprises.  We're simply going along on an emotional journey, through the mind of our protagonist, Annie, and that's how the tension is created.  Sam Raimi creates a haunting mood and Billy Bob Thornton wrote a fine script.  The story is easy-to-follow, and not as mind-bending as some of these other supernatural thrillers.  Just keep in mind that this is not a horror movie. But it's a good mystery and a good mood piece and a damn good film altogether.My score:  7 (out of 10)",The Gift
52,jhclues,"Cate Blanchett Displays Her Own ""Gifts""",9,9 September 2001,"In a small town deep in the South, a single mother endowed with a special ability becomes involved with the disappearance of a young woman and has a brush with the supernatural, in `The Gift,' directed by Sam Raimi.  Cate Blanchett stars as Annie Wilson, a young widow attempting to raise her three kids and provide a decent life for her family, scraping out a living on Social Security since the tragic death of her husband in a work related accident the previous year.  She supplements her meager income by doing `readings' for the local townsfolk, accepting their donations for the insights she offers them into their own lives.  Annie has a `gift,' the ability to see certain things in the cards that enables her to advise her clients about personal issues.  It's something she can't explain; she knows only that it's inherited (which she learned from her grandmother), and that it's real.  And though it's helped her maintain her home, she soon finds that it doesn't always make for the most pleasant of situations, as when she must advise a young woman, Valerie Barksdale (Hilary Swank), on how to cope with her abusive husband, Donnie (Keanu Reeves), or attempt to help a troubled young man, Buddy Cole (Giovanni Ribisi) come to terms with some sensitive aspects of his life.  Then, when a client comes to her to ask for help when his daughter disappears, not only does it take her to the dark side of the human experience, she discovers that certain individuals, including local sheriff Pearl Johnson (J.K. Simmons) do not believe that her `gift' is real.Stylistically crafted and delivered, Raimi's film will keep you engrossed and on the edge of your seat until the very end.  He successfully blends reality with just a touch of the supernatural that makes for riveting suspense while keeping it within the realm of believability.  The relationship played out between Donnie and Valerie is anything but unique-- you've seen this before, many times in many films-- but within the context of this story it's fresh and it works.  The doubtful sheriff and the cynical, jaded defense attorney, Gerald Weems (Michael Jeter), are fairly stereotypical, but that can be easily overlooked in light of the overall story and especially due to the credibility of the Annie character, which is well developed and never presented as anything beyond what can be readily accepted as true to life.  As the central character, Annie anchors the film and enables the circumstances in which she is involved to be perceived as real; it's the strength of the film, and it's what makes it all work so well.What also makes it work is the strong performance by Cate Blanchett, who makes Annie so real and accessible, displaying her `gift' with restraint and avoiding the possible pitfall of taking it too far over the edge, which could easily have made it suspect.  Instead, she brings a depth to the character that draws you into her world and allows you to empathize with her, which would have been impossible had she invested Annie with even a touch of the charlatan.  With consummate skill, Blanchett creates a well rounded character which demonstrates that as an actor, she definitely has a very real `gift' of her own.Ribisi also does a memorable turn as Buddy, with a striking performance in which he creates some disturbing moments that are almost painful to watch; his is a character study of a soul in distress, seeking solace and resolution, and even as he attempts to sort out his life, you are able to sympathize with his plight as you share Buddy's experiences.  And it's through Buddy (as well as Annie, of course), that the audience is able to make that necessary and very real connection with the film.  With films like `Saving Private Ryan' and now this one, Ribisi is on his way to establishing himself as one of the premiere character actors in the business today.Playing somewhat against type, Reeves proves that he can be a good `bad' guy, giving possibly one of his best performances ever as Donnie.  He very credibly conveys that sense of explosiveness lying just beneath the surface that makes his character menacing and dark, which in turn makes Donnie psychologically as well as physically threatening.  It's a good job by Reeves, who deserves credit for taking on a role that is so disagreeable and insensitive.The supporting cast includes Greg Kinnear (Wayne), Katie Holmes (Jessica), Kim Dickens (Linda), Gary Cole (David) and Rosemary Harris (Annie's Granny). A taut thriller that is emotionally involving, `The Gift' delivers what it promises early on, which is exceptional, as many films of this nature often fail to actually follow through after a tremendous opening act.  Rest assured, this one does and has it all; suspense, credibility and some memorable moments, all courtesy of Raimi, a good story and a superb cast. And that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.",The Gift

Sam Raimi and his terrific cast (Cate Blanchett, Giovanni Ribisi, Keanu Reeves, Katie Holmes, Greg Kinnear, Hillary Swank, Gary Cole and Michael Jeter, especially) almost let us forget what a banal, predictable story we are watching.Cate Blanchett (excellent Southern accent)plays Annie Wilson, a recent widow, who has the gift of extrasensory perception.  Annie ""sees things"" and uses a pack of special cards to give advice to a group of some of the most screwed up people you will ever meet.While visiting her son's principal, Wayne Collins (Greg Kinnear), to discuss her oldest son's behavioral problems, Annie meets Jessica King (Katie Holmes, ""all grown up,"" to put it mildly), Wayne's fiance. When Jessica condescending asks Annie ""her future,"" Annie sees Jessica's, and it is, most certainly, not pleasant.This movie could have used at least one, and perhaps two more plot twists. Had writer, Billy Bob Thornton, done that, ""The Gift"" could have been something REALLY special.  Instead, it is ""old hat,"" ""half-baked,"" ""predictable"".

Though THE GIFT is pretty much just another thriller with a more creepy edge to it maybe, but the excitement aren't much of a thrilling experience.Cate Blanchett stars as a psychic woman who sees things threw her black magic cards and threw her own mind. Being haunted and hated by one of the town's dangerous men, Donnie - there suddenly appears a killing in the town. As a woman dies and everything seems to put Donnie as the suspect, though it seems like there's something wrong about the judgment...As said; it includes some pretty good thrills and character performances (especially Blanchett), but the whole movie isn't interesting enough to keep the whole thing to be a good thriller, though it's running time is respecting 102 minutes. Keanu Reeves plays a very little not-Keanu character with his violent, threatening and wife-beating Donnie Barksdale, though it isn't the movie's most convincing performance it's always funny to see actors doing totally different characters than they usually do.It's by all means a psychological thriller, and being at times pretty exciting and good, it doesn't keep this movie from just being a everyday thriller that gets support for Cate Blanchett and Sam Raimi doing a pretty nice job behind the camera after all.",The Gift
59,perfectbond,Defamation of Southern folk (SPOILER),6,3 June 2005,"While The Gift is an undeniably riveting thriller, it is also a very unflattering portrayal of Southern folk. Donnie Barksdale (Keanu Reeves), the most openly devout Christian in the film, rails against ""Jews and {blacks}"" (Barksdale uses another word). He also beats his mousy wife (Hilary Swank) and sports a rebel flag. The clairvoyant pagan Annie (Cate Blanchett) is of course a paragon of virtue and her only real friend is a mentally challenged and sexually exploited mechanic (Giovanni Ribisi). By offering no counterbalancing virtuous Christian character, the filmmakers are irresponsibly suggesting that all devout Christians who are sympathetic to the Confederate cause are uncouth rednecks. The justice system of the South is also defamed. The lawyers are some of the smarmiest seen on screen in recent years and Sheriff Pearl Johnson (J.K. Simmons), while admittedly brilliant comic relief, looks like he couldn't tie his shoes much less solve a murder case. The character is totally out of place in a serious thriller like The Gift and appears to have been written only to insult the justice system of the South. SPOILER: The fact that the killer is revealed to be the shy and reserved school counselor, Wayne (Greg Kinnear), is a suggestion that even the most well adjusted and educated Southerner is a potential killer. On a bright note, Katie Holmes is a very convincing adulteress.",The Gift
60,esteban1747,A Reading-card Woman identifying the facts,6,7 October 2002,"If you like thriller you must see this film, which shows the powers of a widow to see the past, the present and the future. Many people do not believe in such gifted persons, and they are currently called as sorcerers. This film showed how the widow is able to see what happened and helped the police to identify the real killer of another woman. Cate Blanchett and Keanu Reeves starred very well, the first as the widow guessing and the second as a violent man and the supposed killer. Watching the film you may guess who is the killer soon, but it does not matter, this thriller has its own modest merit for touching an argument rejected by many in the society.",The Gift

It has some good scares but also good spiritual sequences and ideas, Keanu Reeves plays a somewhat religious character who clashes against Blanchett's (she plays a sort of fortune teller) it was good to see Reeves in a villainous role.7/10: Good plot and characters along with clever ideas make this a quality watch",The Gift
62,bopdog,"Billy Bob is back! Cate is fantastic and amazing! Movie's spiritual tone is realistic and ""just right""!",10,11 January 2003,"I saw ""The Gift"" on TV, was sucked in by Cate Blanchet's presence, and was further charmed by the whole movie's old-timey Southern Gothic vibe. Great flick! Later I discovered that Billy Bob Thornton was one of the writers (or something?)--- and was pleasantly surprised. He was a good actor, and he showed great promise as a movie maker (check out ""Sling Blade"" ""Primary Colors,"" and even his bit part in the horrible ""Armageddon""). But then his decent into Hollywood Party-fluff and Celeb Pose-O-Rama in the tabloids for a few years sort of took him off the map, serious artist-wise. And his dalliance with 2-dimensional Angela Jolie, and all the other tedious ""Celeb Bulls***"" lifestyle stuff had made me wonder if his talent was gone. Had he become yet another ""used to be"" that burned out and now only appears on TV in lame-o crap such as ""Hollywood Squares"" or at celeb ""charity"" ego-fests? NO! ""The Gift"" would indicate that Billy Bob is back with us, and that is a good thing.""The Gift"" is a suspense drama, or something. Kind of a thriller, but the events are less important than the characters' relationship to the events. I suppose not knowing the ending in advance would give a degree of excitement--- but one could see this movie a second time and still enjoy the performances.The supernatural touch was just right--- hundreds of thousands, or perhaps millions, of people have just such visions at some time, usually unbidden. What struck me as ""accurate"" in this movie was the emphasis on how such visions are indeed no different than ""regular"" sights. One begins to understand that having a ""vision"" is no different than looking out a window--- you see stuff. The meaning you derive from what you see is purely subjective, however. Who you fundamentally are is still the backdrop against which you then undertake understandings or behaviors, whether you are seeing physical objects or meta-physical objects. The movie subtly brings this out as well. Cate's visions don't propel the plot, nor are they critical to the movie itself--- it is her relationship to the visions that is the movie's core. This relationship is also the kind of thing that many, many people contend with daily, in the real world.Overall, great movie!",The Gift
63,FlickJunkie-2,A standout performance by Ribisi,5,6 August 2001,"Apart from an outstanding performance by Giovanni Ribisi, there is nothing terribly remarkable about this paranormal whodunit.  The plot is extremely predictable.  If they hung a big sign on the killer that said `MURDERER', it couldn't have been more obvious than the way director Sam Raimi constructed the story around Billy Bob Thornton's screenplay.Kate Blanchett does a good job as the fortune teller, although I wouldn't put it on a par with `Elizabeth'.  Keanu Reeves seems to be trying very hard to shed his good guy image, following his performance as a psychopathic killer in the `The Watcher' with this role as an evil country boy.  I would have to say that he was more convincing as a bad guy in this film than `The Watcher', but he is still not cut out for the villain roles.Katie Holmes is another actor who uses this film to attempt to break out of her mold as the sweet teen.  She tries hard to play the shrew, spicing it up with some R rated nudity and profanity, but ultimately comes across as spoiled sarcastic brat, landing not far from the teen perception she is trying to shed.  This is a step backwards for her after a very solid performance in `Wonder Boys'.  Greg Kinnear is awful as Mr. Perfect schoolteacher, and his attempt at creating romantic tension between his character and Blanchett's is abysmally inept.And then there is Ribisi.  I have liked Giovanni in every role in which I've seen him.  The kid can flat-out act.  Here he outclasses the entire cast with a gut wrenching performance as Buddy, an emotionally disturbed character whose most important reason for being in the film is to add to the list suspects.  Luckily, Raimi wove in enough of Buddy's story to give Ribisi an opportunity to strut his stuff, because his performance is one of the few things that elevate this film from mediocrity.  Ribisi throws himself into the part, ripping his heart out and shredding it right on screen (for all you horror addicts, that was a metaphor, not a literal description).  If Ribisi keeps belting out performances like this, he could well become another Dustin Hoffman, Al Pacino or Robert DeNiro, great actors who didn't fit the standard leading man mold, but made it on pure talent.Overall, this was a middling story with average acting, mundane direction and a standout performance by an up and coming actor in a supporting role. I rated it a 5/10.  Worth seeing for Giovanni.",The Gift

Annabelle feels that she can't help, but this doesn't stop her from constantly getting visions of Jessica's fate.I don't have a great knowledge of Sam Raimi's films, outside of the 'Spider-Man' series, so i was interested to see what this film could offer. Especially with stars, such as Cate Blanchett, Greg Kinnear and Giovanni Ribisi. What i found to be watching was a good thriller, which i actually enjoyed. The film is your usual 'who dunnit?' film, but this didn't stopped me from enjoying the characters portrayed. Everyone has a different personality, with some being excellent and some being acceptable. It can start to becoming obvious when you get about 40 minutes into the film. I had already worked out who was the likeliest suspect before i had even reached this point of the film.

67,buiger,How to make a lot out of little...,6,27 January 2010,"I tend to agree with both Ebert's and Berardinelli's reviews yet again (it's been a while now, for several consecutive films, and it is starting to worry me...). A film that had all the ingredients of a ""B"" movie turned out to be a pretty good motion picture. This is contrary to what usually happens in many movies where potentially good material is spoiled by the makers of the film. It only goes to show that given good Directing and a cast of excellent actors doing their best, anything can be made into a good, or at least enjoyable film.The acting is really good all around, but I would have to single out Cate Blanchett whose performance was certainly worthy of at least an Oscar Nomination for Best Actress in a leading role. The way she portrayed Annabelle was utterly believable, her fear and feelings where well tangible to the viewer, and her accent was phenomenal... Even Ribisi, whom I am not a fan of, gives a powerful performance. The movie turned out to be rather tense, and even the 'who done it' wasn't completely obvious until close to the end of the picture. All things considered, well done!",The Gift
68,bat-5,Good and spooky.,7,12 February 2001,"In The Gift, Cate Blanchett is blessed(or cursed?) with the ability to sense things that no ordinary person can see.  She is asked by the police to aid in the search of a missing person and what follows, is a journey into the supernatural.  Sam Raimi knows how to set up a scene for the maximum scare potential.  Honed on his Evil Dead series, Raimi lets a scene begin slowly and allows the viewer to sense the dread and feel the suspense build.  There are visual tricks, interesting camera techniques and the fine performances by a very talented cast that propel this story forward.  Among this cast that really stands out is Keanu Reeves. People have always complained that Reeves brings down a movie.  At least some of the people I know.  I prefer to think that Reeves is an underrated actor.  In the role of Donny Barksdale, Reeves brings a certain menace to his character that usually isn't scene in his other roles. Barksdale isn't a creature of the night, or a space alien, but a flesh and blood creature that is capable of true evil.  When you watch him, look at his eyes and you'll see a true menace lurking behind those dark brown eyes. Cate Blanchett shows that she can master just about any accent that's out there.  She sounds like she's a native of the south and she has a quiet courage about her.  Most notable when she's squaring off against Reeves.  All in all, The Gift is a wonderfully atmospheric thriller.  It has brains and doesn't insult the viewers.  It will keep you hooked up until the very end, and there are quite a few surprises throughout the film.  Highly entertaining, and very spooky at times.",The Gift
69,twelve-house-books,Reeves as a Redneck,2,29 June 2019,"Kate Blanchett is utterly convincing as a South Alabama woman, and maybe because her father was from Texas. In any case, she deserved a far better supporting cast. Keanu Reeves has done some good stuff like THE MATRIX, and some stinkers like DRACULA. This is one of the latter. Really? A redneck? And one who doesn't even have an Alabaman accent? And what's up with casting uptown girl Hillary Swank as the redneck wife? This is a joke, right? The whole film would have been one big joke if it hadn't been for Blanchett's truly stellar, realistic performance. You might want to skip this one unless you want to see Blanchett do yet another character to perfection. I mean, any actor who can play Bob Dylan so that many people can't tell whether it's the real Dylan or not deserves accolades, right?",The Gift
70,room102,Good performance,6,10 September 2001,"Fantastic performances by Cate Blanchett and Giovanni Ribisi. This is the first time I see either of them, so I can't compare their performance to any of their pervious roles. The other members of the cast give a good performance as well. Katie Holmes' much talked-about topless scene is definitely with taste and I don't think it was put there to draw the younger audience to see the movie. However, I do feel it wasn't vital, and the story would have stayed intact without it. Danny Elfman gives what seems to be the shortest cameo in cinema ever. As my favorite composer/musician I was looking forward to his cameo and expected it to be a speaking part and a bit longer. Nonetheless, he did a good job. I don't know why he was so hard on himself with the outcome. (BTW, did he remind you of Beetlejuice too?) Sam Raimi did a great job. He made the characters highly believable, and brought out a very realistic performance from the cast - notably the violent scene in which Donnie Barksdale (Keanu Reeves) breaks into Annie's home and drags his wife (Hilary Swank) out, while Annie is chasing them and slip on the paint. The first half of the movie is fascinating. However, it is the second half - which suppose to be suspenseful and more interesting than the first - that I found quite weak. Perhaps it was because I knew who the killer was; perhaps it was because the overall feeling was that after all there isn't much suspense, that the details given before don't contribute a lot, other than to try to confuse the viewer a bit, and that at the end it's just a very simple story, which can be summed up in one sentence; And finally, perhaps it was because some of the characters were highly detailed, while others (such as the murdered woman herself) were very low on details and almost absent. * MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD * Several things that disturbed me the most were before and during the trial. First, why would it be so bad for the prosecution that a Psychic had told the police where to find the body - does it matter WHY they came to look for the body at the lake? The facts stayed the same - none of them was based on a ""Psychic evidence"". Also, while Annie was on the stand, I felt that it was only reasonable for the prosecutor to say ""Objection. The witness is not the defendant here!"". Another thing was Donnie Barksdale on the stand. A wife-beating redneck that suddenly becomes a lamb, confessing (in court!) of beating up his wife and realizing he's a ""bad guy"" doing unchristian things. The beatings are also taken as granted a few scenes earlier, when Donnie beats up Annie in front of a surprisingly indifferent Sheriff. * END OF SPOILERS * Overall, I think the story is the weakest point in the film. If it was for the first part alone, I'd give the movie a 7/10, but at the end I felt quite disappointed, which brings it to a 6/10. Good score by Chris Young.",The Gift
71,barberoux,Cast makes it good.,7,13 August 2001,"The Gift is an OK supernatural/murder mystery movie.  The cast, including Cate Blanchett, Giovanni Ribisi, Hilary Swank, Greg Kinnear and Katie Holmes, make the movie worth seeing, especially Cate Blanchett.  She is an excellent actress and seems too good for this movie.  The trouble with the script is in the final reel where multiple people are set up as the killer but we know only one is the true one.  I felt this was rather clumsily done and somewhat overly dramatized.  The strength of the performances held the movie together.  Cate Blanchett deserves a much better script.

72,the amorphousmachine,Good Supernatural Thriller,7,28 May 2001,"The Gift, written by Billy Bob Thornton and Tom Epperson and directed by Sam Riami, is a supernatural spine-tingler based in a small town in Georgia. The story revolves around Annie (Cate Blanchett), who is a single mother and widow who has an extraordinary power- or more appropriately, a gift. Her psychic ability helps her see into the past, present and future. She uses her talent through tarot cards readings to provide income for her children, but also to assist the various people in sorting out their lives. There is Buddy, played brilliantly by Giovanni Ribisi, who is mentally unstable and has to fight his demons from the past. Then there is Valerie Barksdale (Hilary Swank) who is in an abusive relationship with her violent husband Donnie, played by Keanu Reeves (who is surprisingly convincing), who begins to torment Annie when he finds out about his wife's visits.The story unfolds when Jessica King (Katie Holmes) disappears, who was soon to be married to local school headmaster, Wayne Collins (Greg Kinnear). He then convinces the Police to enlist Annie's help, and her 'gift' in searching for the whereabouts of his fiancée. This creates an interesting whodunit as Annie begins to uncover the grisly truth, where the townsfolk are all potential suspects. However, The Gift doesn't manage to be edge-of-your-seat material, as the pacing lacks tightness and the ending was somewhat predictable. Also Katie Holmes was miscast in her role, but her fans should still enjoy her performance. Regardless, with Sam Riami's excellent direction and strong performances from the cast, The Gift entertains and becomes a worthy addition to the supernatural thriller genre. ***1/2 out of *****!",The Gift

People who wants to see a certain actor or actress will always go to see them in any kind of movie. Because I love Cate Blanchett, I watch this from minute one to the end. Cate was sensitive and very good, so are most of the actors. This is the only good point about this bad film. It's full of clichés (storm, shadows, thunder, rain, slow motion) and stereotypes (women are victims, chief of police is almost dumb). It's also badly written, and so and so directed.

After the first half hour, I was so hooked by the story and gripping pace of the film that I checked IMDb to find out who directed. It was no surprise when I saw Raimi's name. The movie sucks you in with it's fine pacing, script, and fantastic performances.The cast is as solid as it gets for a film. Two Oscar winners included, what more can I say. There are few movies that can be mentioned in the same breath as ""The Gift"" when it comes to suspenseful thrillers. It's hard to pick a favorite, but Blanchett played the part well and was convincing as a psychic medium. The stress that comes with having such a gift is depicted well by her. Giovanni Ribisi was probably the show stealer, and I say probably because the other cast members were masterful, including Keanu Reeves who had never crossed my mind as someone who could play a villainous character. He was great, as was Hiliary Swank.The script was solid, and there were no wasted scenes in this movie at all. Each scene makes the next one better. Another great thing about this film is that it wasn't predictable. It keeps you guessing until the minor twist at the end.

81,BigGuy,Disturbing and suspenceful,6,20 January 2001,"The gift reminded me a lot of Sling Blade.  Very rural (redneck) setting, with the concentration on the setting and the characterization rather than the story itself.  The story is more a means to explore the characters.One of the flaws with a movie written in this manner is that it can become rather predictable.  Maybe not the exact details, but the general path the story will follow.  A number of people I overheard while leaving the theater commented ""I knew that was going to happen.""But in spite of the slight predictability, the movie was quite good.  There are a couple of other minor complaints that might make some people less interested.  First the story is very slow developing.  The first half of the film is really background material for the meat of the movie.  The other complaint is the overuse of suspenceful situations.  Woman walking through a creaking house checking on a noise sort of thing.  Sure this is a suspence movie, but the audience can only sit through so much before it become blatant and irritating.The best performance in this movie I would have to say is given by Giovana Ribisi.  He is also the character that adds perhaps the most disturbing images of the movie.  I had read some stuff prior to seeing the movie that were spoilers, and even then I was not quite prepared for the power of the imagery presented.

83,RogerBorg,"Whoa, dude: Keanu Reeves can actually act.",10,5 May 2007,"And this is the film that proves it. No one was more surprised than me to discover that he can be utterly convincing playing against type as a truly vile, unsympathetic character, but he pulled it off with aplomb. We're not talking about his role as the leather-trousered pantomime villain Don John in Much Ado About Nothing; this is a thoroughly foul, menacing, sneering performance.Perhaps Sam Raimi is to thank for that performance - he is at his best directing among peeling paintwork and limpid pools - or we could blame previous directors for not challenging him enough. Either way, it shows that the man has a range that's usually underused.Katie Holmes (just 21 at the time of filming) is also pitch-perfect in a role that many actresses would shy away from, or try to inject some sympathy into. Holmes instead just exudes uncompromising conceit and arrogance, and kudos to her for that.Giovanni Ribisi seems to have cornered the market on unstable loners, and turns in his usual sterling performance, and Hilary Swank isn't really challenged by playing skinny white trash. I don't rate her as an actress, but at least this role allows her to play to her strengths: i.e. annoying and ineffectual.If there's a weakness in the cast, it's Kinnear, who is just a soupcon too awkwardly wholesome, and occasionally doesn't seem to be in the same scene as the rest of the cast.Commenting on Cate Blanchett's performance would be superfluous. Watching her watching paint dry would be a compelling experience. She combines the raw edgy charisma and overwhelming talent of De Niro with the elegance and grace of Hepburn. Sublime, utterly, worshipfully sublime.With a cast and director like that, the actual plot is almost irrelevant, but it proceeds competently enough; the supernatural component is admirably underplayed and matter-of-fact, the ""whodunnit"" mystery is maintained until into the third act, and the (expected) twist at the end has a (unexpected) twist. The pacing remains fine all the way to the end, and the cinematography is simple enough to not get in the way of the story. The ever reliable Christopher Young scores the film in a very restrained and appropriate way.This, taken as a whole, is a masterclass in cinematography. Fine actors, directed by a perfectionist, telling a compelling story, shot, edited and scored in a way that compliments their strengths rather than distracting. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen for a second, and it doesn't get any better than that.",The Gift
84,TheRadiobox,Gifted cast members elevate a mid-tier movie,6,8 April 2021,"The Gift was directed by Sam Raimi, written by Billy Bob Thornton and Tom Epperson, and stars Cate Blanchett, Greg Kinnear, Keanu Reeves, Hilary Swank, Giovanni Ribisi, J. K. Simmons, and Katie Holmes. It's about a fortune teller with a sixth sense leading an investigation as to the whereabouts of a young woman.The Plot: Raimi has always been a director whose works are easy to identify thanks to his frequently idiosyncratic characters and often over-the-top black humor with some slapstick on the side. In that way, the Gift doesn't have the feeling of a Raimi movie, but it works better because of it. After receiving news that her son has gotten in a fight, Annie (Blanchett) meets with the principal, Wayne (Kinnear) and is introduced to Jessica (Holmes), a less-than-loyal woman who turns up dead. Having had an affair with Donnie (Reeves), a violent man married to Annie's client, Valerie (Swank), she is sure Jessica's disappearance and eventual death is Donnie's doing, Annie goes to sheriff Johnson (Simmons) who takes Donnie in; but when her visions aren't adding up, she continues her investigation and dealings with the mentally ill Buddy (Ribisi) despite the case's closure. Aside from the clairvoyance of Annie, the plot is familiar and goes in the most marketable direction. It didn't need gore or comedy, but a few changes are definitely in order.The Characters: None of the characters are really anything special, even Annie who is special. Plenty of other mystery movies contain the same archetypes that this script does, and while what's written isn't great; the universally solid performances pick up a fair bit of that slack. Annie is a widowed single mother who really doesn't like to talk about herself or her past, instead focusing on her family and her clients. As far as her abilities go, there's not much in the way of explanation, which doesn't help in giving her life. Valerie helps to make Annie more human by way of their friendship and continued butting of heads when it comes to Donnie's behavior; and it's clear she still has something for him in some way even though she knows she shouldn't. The rest of the characters are merely pawns for the mystery, and blatantly so. Donnie is an intimidating heavy, Wayne is a pseudo love interest, Johnson is a stock sheriff, and Buddy is another way to show Annie's commitments.The Mystery: Thornton and Epperson's script may go through the plot and character motions with little of note, but the whodunnit angle is a success. A modest one to be sure, but credit is due. Even before Jessica's disappearance there are subtle moments where characters seem antsy, as though they know more than they let on. It's more to the credit of the actors than the movie itself but the little tics are curious enough to hold attention until the real questions are asked. The movie does a good job of setting up the circumstances and providing strong evidence against Donnie and against Annie and it eventually segues into a courtroom case which is easily one of the highlights of the movie. Some of the good will brought on by the questions asked during the latter half of the runtime is diminished simply because it's been more than clear that Annie does indeed have powers; but whatever is lost is found again thanks to a decently surprising reveal, although the real culprit has few options by movie's end.The Technics: Pacing is a major issue in The Gift. The first 45ish minutes drag on since the characters are being set up with little in the way of creativity or depth and Jessica's disappearance has yet to happen; leaving the movie dawdling until it decides to cut to the chase. Compensating for a lumbering runtime is the atmosphere created by the thick accents the actors put on, the beautiful but decaying community, and the bits of realistic southern attire and churchgoing behavior. No matter where The Gift goes, it feels real, which grounds the story further than the writing does. Exposition is a bit clunky too, with characters just saying how they feel after things happen, even though the actors do a good job at showing how they feel with just their faces. It's overkill that easily could've been remedied like a lot of things in here.Talented actors and a few solid scenes are what hold The Gift together. A lack of explanation to more interesting questions, a flabby script, and mediocre characters do a number to the movie. While they sometimes overreach, if not for the cast this movie would play like the retread that it is.63/100.",The Gift
85,jrfranklin01,Predictable But Good,6,25 March 2005,"""The Gift"" stars Cate Blanchett (""The Missing"") as Annie Wilson, a widowed mother of three who uses her psychic powers to tell fortunes for her local townsfolk.

While some of the film is rather predictable, the cast and suspense keep things interesting.

The stereotypes, if I lived in the southern states I think I would sue Hollywood.  I know there are problems there, but I don't believe everyone is a wife beater and a child molester, not too mention that every police officer is corrupt, of course. The story, it was so obvious from virtually the first scene, who was responsible for the murder.  The police didn't bother to investigate a little more than they did, the body is there so he must be guilty.In the end a pointless, painfully slow, forgettable film.

90,rmarkd,pretty good movie with great acting,6,12 June 2020,"The Gift is a movie about a woman named Annie (Cate Blanchett) who has a gift of seeing things that haven't happened or seeing things in other places. She unfortunately, isn't able to see that her husband was going to die. Now husbandless with three kids, she lives of SS support and the donations she gets for her fortune tellings.One of her clients is a woman named Valerie (Hilary Swank) who has a husband Donnie Barksdale (Keanu Reeves), who beats her. She also has another regular client buddy (Giovanni Ribisi) who really seems to need a therapist rather than a fortune teller.Things tense up when Annie senses that Jessica (Katie Holmes), the fiancee of Wayne Collins (Greg Kinnear) and daughter of a rich guy has been murdered. They find her in a pond next to Donnie. Donnie has scratch marks that are tied to Jessica.Donnie's tried and convicted, but wait, it's not actually him. Jessica's ghost tells Annie this by scaring her, Annie finds it's really Wayne, post suicide Buddy saves Annie, movie ends.First of all, the acting is pretty great. Cate Blanchett is just incredible. Keanu is great, as is Hilary Swank. Giovanni Ribisi is absolutely wonderful in the movie and pretty much on par with Cate Blanchett. Katie Holmes continues her streak in movies where I've found her acting underwhelming. Perhaps I just haven't seen her in the right movie, but I was not impressed with her in Go, Wonder Boys, Batman Begins, or this movie. That said, I guess I understand her... uh, contributions.The plot is somewhat predictable. That's not so much a knock on the movie as I think the twist is not so much meant to be a Sixth Sense/Usual Suspects level sucker punch of a plot twist, but is just used to have a third act. Yeah, you know there's going to be a twist and yeah, you pretty much know who the actual villain is.The other thing that bothered me is that the supernatural elements happened in such a manner to just advance the plot one step. She could have easily had a vision of who the real killer is, but then, the movie would have been over. It's a minor thing, but still something that tarnishes the movie.The other other thing are the loose ends. Okay, Donnie's out. That's great for Valerie, I guess? Buddy kills himself, but I guess that's okay because ghost buddy saves the day. And now, how is Annie supposed to get her car door fixed with Buddy all dead and stuff?That said, it's still pretty good with great acting. 6/10",The Gift
91,bburns,Another fun ride with Sam Raimi (contains spoilers),8,6 April 2001,"In films such as ""Evil Dead 2"" and ""Darkman"", Sam Raimi used lots of flashy camera tricks and special effects to shock and thrill audiences.  In ""A Simple Plan"", there were no camera tricks at all, and the effects were subtle, but audiences were still thrilled and shocked because of the strength of the great screenplay, story, and acting.  With ""The Gift"", Raimi tries to have it both ways, and for the most part succeeds.In the script, Billy Bob Thornton has combined the best elements of his own ""Sling Blade"" and M. Night Shyalaman's ""The Sixth Sense"".  Psychic Annie Wilson (Cate Blanchett) has visions of the future and converses with dead people, and manages to make a very meager living with it.  In her rural Arkansas hometown, she has to contend with Donnie (Keanu Reeves)--a wife-beating alcoholic who threatens Annie and her kids--and Buddy (Giovanni Ribisi)--a semi-retarded, mentally ill mechanic with a penchant for violence.  The story--as with all Thornton screenplays--takes its own sweet time to unfold, but the time is not wasted.  The main plot concerns the disappearance of Jessie (Katie Holmes), a country club socialite engaged to the local elementary school principal (Greg Kinnear).  Annie with her supernatural powers is the only one who can figure out what happened.As to the direction:  Raimi goes back to his roots, so to speak.  The film is hardly short on spectacle.  But it is a more subtle variety than in his pre-""Simple Plan"" movies.  Raimi, like Shyalaman and Alfred Hitchcock, seems to know that the devil is in the details.  He's figured out that a shadow passing by a window is scarier than a screaming blood-gorged zombie. He's discovered what depths of fear can be culled from a dripping water faucet.The only thing uneven about this film is the acting.  It ranges from the sublime (Blanchett, Hilary Swank) to the putrid (Ribisi, Kinnear).  Katie Holmes--who has done well for herself in ""The Ice Storm"", ""Go"", and ""Wonder Boys""--is badly miscast in her first (and hopefully last) role as a heartless, promiscuous bad girl.  On the other hand, even though Keanu Reeves has made several movies in the last decade, ""The Gift"" marks his *acting* debut.""The Gift"" is not Sam Raimi's best film.  The script and acting in ""A Simple Plan"" are far superior.  But those two films in combination give hope that Sam Raimi is evolving from being merely a cult director to being a truly great filmmaker.  I'm looking forward to his next work.  8 out of 10.",The Gift

None the less, can't Hollywood accurately portray a southerner.  It's like they've never met anyone from there. Giovanni Ribisi is the only real gift, he and his crowbar made the flick for me, but the never-ending story with subplot after subplot made it hellish to sit through, what was Billy Bob smoking?  Sam Raimi offers some moody and at times surreal visuals, but its all for not and his talents are wasted.

Been waiting for that really good scary movie (no, not THAT movie) to come out and one hasn't yet, so still waiting patiently...Cate Blanchett is a psychic and psychicly sees a murder taking place, so she spends 2 thirds of the movie working out who dunnit and who didn't do it. Her performance was really very good and she played her character well. Keanu Reeves, however, was very unconvincing as a wife-bashing red-neck husband. His acting is questionable most times, but here he's almost amusing as he tries his best to look like a real low bully of a bad guy.The End Act was a groaning disappointment, it is just a long, over-used cliche.

94,midge56,Cate's accent was phenomenal,9,7 April 2010,"A great movie... engrossing with compelling acting from the entire cast. Cate reminded me of Sissy Spacek in this movie. I was just blown away by the quality of Cate's accent. There was not a hint of her British accent. In fact, her southern accent sounded so natural, after hearing her speak in her British accent on the bonus features... I had to watch the movie a second time just to listen to her accent in this role. Not a hint. It was amazing. Her acting skills are phenomenal.However, it is too bad she chops her hair off. That cropped hair makes her look ill like Mia Farrow on Rosemary's Baby. It must be difficult for the makeup crews to deal with her hair that short.Keanu was a little disturbing in this role. It wasn't him... it was more the role which was pretty brutal.Giovanni did an Oscar worthy performance in his role. He was quite believable as a tormented soul.Hillary, while she fit the role well... looked rather sickly in real life. Severely under weight.Brilliant movie even if some of the events fit the typical pattern, Cate's role brought a deep compelling presence to the story which pulled the audience in.I highly recommend the movie but a little too brutal for the kids...

Katie Holmes completely shatters her sweet girl-next-door image and appears in a totally new light, it's quite a shock to see her play the resident get-around-girl.  Giovanni Ribisi brings the disturbed character of Buddy to life quite well, and kudos to Greg Kinnear as Wayne.There are frights a-plenty so be prepared, though the film does move a little slowly at times.

96,jimmyplm,"Better than ""The 6th Sense""",10,20 January 2001,"""The Gift"" was an excellent movie.  Believe me, you won't regret seeing this film.  The cast is excellent.  I especially loved Katie Holmes's shocking role in the film--I never would have thought the shy little girl from Dawson's Creek would have evolved into such a sultry lady. 
The movie is like ""The 6th Sense"" meets William Faulkner.  There are a lot of zany Southern characters to watch in the movie (apparently there is no such thing as a ""normal"" person in the South as far as Hollywood is concerned).  Anyone who is a fan of thrillers should enjoy this movie. There are a lot of scares, laughs, and disturbing ideas to chew on within this ambitious film.  I was very pleased to have seen it on opening night at the local theater.Here is a quick indication of how good the movie is: Seven friends and I went to see the movie last night.  We are a very diverse group of people, but oddly enough we ALL liked this movie.  It gave us a lot to talk about during the night.  Do yourself a favor.

97,teejayniles2345,Screenwriter and director should've studied PSYCHO a little more,9,26 May 2002,"This feature film was on my ""to-see"" list for awhile; over Memorial Day Weekend I got around to viewing the DVD and do recommend it to other mystery/thriller fans (9 *'s).  It could've been a better movie if some attention to Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO and REAR WINDOW would've been paid. A better plot twist would've been for the murdered fiancee to have been found in a car trunk, a la murdered Marian in the PSYCHO swamp/dump.  Also, some more attention to how law enforcement can be helpful instead of just obtuse could be learned from REAR WINDOW.  The 2000 film is quite quirky with some of its casting but I found its primary strengths the ethereal performance of Cate Blanchett and the manic unpredictability of Giovanni Riblisi.  The director, Sam Raimi, demonstrates a characteristic way of tipping his hand in a ""double cross"" kind of way here but I had guessed the ""not-so-smart"" ending regardless.  The film is highly spooky in regard to water dripping and the non-traditional use of ESP cards; I found it to be also non-stereotypical as far as the parent taking responsibility for what the kid needs supervision on.  The courtroom scenes, however, seemed a bit plagiarized in my opinion (a flip-flop of the innocent defendant in TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD).  The back-story of the family and their grief deserves some expansion; is there a sequel possible here?  The extras on the DVD are excellent; I highly recommend the ""making of"" documentary.",The Gift

100,ks4,"Intense supernatural thriller, though flawed and filled with cliches.",6,2 May 2004,"The GiftAnnie Wilson is the local ""witch"", the woman who predicts the future for some people, some believes her, some does not. Though one day the police are stuck in a murder case and their only chance is to ask help at the ""Witch"", as she starts on the case she finds nothing. Later on her dreams starts giving her visions of the murder though.This movie is in a way a classic ""Who did it"" movie, and it does indeed keep its murderer hidden, it's not the butler, so don't expect that :) However there aren't many clues given to who the real killer is, at least i didn't see any, and the one i saw was wrong. This makes the end seem a bit like a relieve, like finally we discovered it, and it is naturally not what one expected. However the end is flawed, some of the visions of the murdering just didn't fit with the murder for me, i am not going to give to many spoilers here, i just found the end of the movie rather flawed at the twist, and especially the second twist seemed meaningless and pushed too hard to give a deeper meaning to the movie.The movie naturally is a suspenseful thriller, however many of the shocking scenes are build upon various cliches, the movie has stolen various parts from random classic movies and already used schemes. For example one will notice that everytime there is a shocking scene the subsense technique is often used, also the use of lightning and loud sounds are often getting used together with the same music routine, i spotted it early on, but still managed to get one shock in the best scene of the movie, but it is obvious that the director have borrowed his techniques from other movies and experimentation. Therefore the movie doesn't bring much new to this genre and does not revolutionate in any way, it comes and does it's job, and it does it pretty well.It's obvious that the director is doing a routine work, or maybe he doesn't know better, it's not very experimental and there is frequent use of basic film education, even for a basic film study guy as me, he uses the basic camera angles, music. But he uses them the correct way, a standard job for the directing, it's not spectacular, but it's not awful in any way either. I have seen better and more experimental work from Sam Raini, feels like he is having just another day at work here. The horror scenes especially, he uses the usual suspense as has been scene many times before, which is also one of the reasons they aren't always shocking, there are about 3 times where i was thrilled so i could feel it, the 3rd time was the best.This movie has a very good cast, all of them are doing a good job, and it's interesting to see Katie Holmes stepping out of her Dawson's Creek character and try to do some daring acting, i think she succeds pretty good. The rest of the cast are all above average, and are one of the reasons the movie is interesting all the way through.To sum it all up a bit this is quite a good movie, it's entertaining and keeps you guessing to the very last moment, ignore the end and it's even better. The movie has a few flaws, or copied moments so to speak, everything has more or less been seen before which brings the movie down a little, a little more originality would have made the movie much better. But the movie does have its moment and it never gets boring.6/10",The Gift
101,DAHLRUSSELL,Supernaturally Surprising!,9,7 December 2006,"This is a really well done supernatural murder mystery thriller, with really top notch performances throughout. It feels a little familiar, but holds plenty of surprises along the way. Cate Blanchett does a really creditable job of playing a lower class American Southern gal who has ""a gift."" A real success of this film is presenting her visions and dreams in a way that are flawed, and that makes them seem all the more real.The roles are stereotypes, but if you have Southern family, you know these stereotypes exist for a reason. They are all fleshed out beautifully and brought to life with an edge of danger. Hillary Swank (in her first role after BOYS DON'T CRY) plays an abused, beaten wife, filled with real ambivalence. Giovani Ribisi plays a disturbed Boo Radley type with a oddly romantic soul. Greg Kinnear plays the quiet School Principal while Katie Holm plays his socialite girlfriend and bares all, displaying the natural gifts that captured Tom Cruise. The real stand out surprise of this cast is the knock out performance of Keanu Reeves as the wife beating, cheating redneck. He's a character actor! Who knew?! No wonder his leading men are so boring - they don't interest him. He is simply fantastic here and holds his own with Ribisi. The special effects are kept to a minimum, so that they are extremely effective here. While overall this is the stuff of a TV murder mystery, the performances, script, and sensitive handling make this a tense, tight thriller, calibrated for maximum suspense.",The Gift
102,Valkonian,This was an enjoyable haunted mystery....,7,20 June 2007,"I really enjoyed this movie. While the mystery was attainable if you watched the movie closely, the performances by Blanchett, Reeves, Swank, and others is very good.I'm not a fan of Reeves, but he does an excellent performance here. The movie blends a goof amount of humor and scary techniques to keep you into the film.I would have given it a higher rating, except in a trial there are forensics to prove guilt or innocence, and they seem to gloss over those in this movie. Maybe because it was set in a very rural town? Regardless, I greatly enjoyed watching Blanchett. She really portrayed her character in a superb way.I highly recommend this movie.",The Gift
103,NicolasCostoglou,A real film about people...,9,15 February 2017,"The Gift is one of the more serious films made by Sam Raimi,which is not a positive and not a negative thing, because this movie is as good as Evil Dead, or Spider-Man, only a different kind of Story.It's from 2000, around this time people seemed to make movies to tell interesting stories, not just to sell toys, and this movie is a great example. It's written by the well-known actor Billy Bob-Thornton who was inspired by his mother who apparently had some sort of psychic powers. If you believe something like that or not is completely subjective and has no impact on your enjoyment of this fictional tale, which is very dramatic and very well told.The camera-work isn't as outrages and wild as in over Raimi movies, which fits the story and underlines the tone of the movie perfectly. Because of this, the creative and intense scenes in which the protagonist has symbolic dreams, or psychic premonitions are all the more effective, and the visual effects are almost unnoticeable, even after all these years.The acting in this film is overall fantastic, one of the strongest reasons why this movie works for me is that i was completely engaged. I was afraid that Cate Blanchett's character, or her children could get hurt by Keanu Reeves, who's unbelievably threatening in this film and gives one of his best performances. Not to mention Giovanni Ribisi, J.K. Simmons, Katie Holmes or especially Greg Kinnear.The soundtrack by Christopher Young (who Raimi would later work with on Spider-Man 3) also fits well for the setting and atmosphere.

105,mercury-26,Haunts you,8,3 March 2001,"Sam Raimi's work here shows a lot of growth. He's on his way to perfecting the psychological thriller, taking a step up from the also great ""A Simple Plan"".Cate Blanchett is Annie Wilson, a small town clairvoyant and fortune teller who reads tarot cards for a group of regular customers. She claims she can't do it for financial gain or it won't work. So any compensation she receives for her services are conveniently called 'donations'. If there is any benefit to her at all, her gift doesn't work. It's not just money either. She can't tell her own fortune, for instance, because her emotions block the way.The main question the film wants the audience to ask is, by telling people their futures, is she really helping them? Her clientele are among the town's most fragile, desperate, afraid. In a way, she's taking advantage of them. At the same time people like Buddy (the amazing Giovanni Ribisi) need her like a drug. She's become his guardian angel, protecting him from himself.  Another client, Valerie (Hillary Swank), comes to Annie often to see if her future holds anything better than her abusive husband Donnie.The first plot point is the disappearance of Jessica King (Katie Holmes). Having no leads and no suspects, the skeptical town authorities go to Annie and ask for her help. Not only is the woman missing, Annie finds, but she's dead. A suspect is found, tried, and convicted, but Annie's name and profession are dragged through the mud in the process. What's worse, Annie begins to fear she may have helped to convict the wrong guy. From this point on it becomes a pretty good whodunnit, with many possible suspects. The big secret isn't revealed until nearly the last scene.Much of this strikes you as cliche', using a lot of small hicktown stereotypes to move the story. But Annie's character is so original and interesting, all is forgiven. Everything around her needs to be the way we'd expect in order for her character to be the outcast. Her 'kind' is not exactly welcome in this small, Southern, church going community.Raimi's usual flawless direction also makes a huge difference. It's not until long after you've left the theater that you realize why he's chosen to show you the images he has, in the order he shows them in. ""The Gift"" is a truly haunting experience.Grade: B",The Gift
106,poetellect,"very predictable, somewhat pretentious, but CATE and GIOVANNI save it",10,25 January 2001,"I'll admit, I went into this film thinking I was in for a ride.  And yes, there are some brief scary moments.  Yet, it's nothing new...it's what I call ""stupid scary"", you know, the stuff we've all seen in ""What Lies Beneath"", etc.  So to make a long review short, to watch this movie, you have to get past a few things.  First, Keanu Reeves.  No matter how much people insinuate his ""growth"" as an actor, I just don't see it- there easily coul dhave been at least ten other actors that could have easily of been cast as a brutal, racist, wife-beating redneck and pull off some of the dialouge which Thorton's script leaves somewhat to be desired.  Second, the long, drawn out court-room scenes.  What can I say?  Excepting Grisham and Schumacher, these can get boring.  Thirdly, the predictability.  It's SOOO predictable.  I mean, Wes Craven should have been called to spice up the twists, at least put some twists in- and there is one, at the very end, but nothing you didn't see coming.  I was expecting something more like L.A. Confidential or Hitch-cocky, with a gothic twist.  Anyway, if you can get past all these things, look at the ACTING.  Here's where brilliant actors take a somewhat mediocre script, no, not mediocre, rather- I'd say more systematic, or trite, in other words, and weave some powerful drama.  The scenes between Cate Blanchett and Giovanni Ribisi carried me through this film- Ribisi gives a tour-de-fource preformance, very intense.  Even though I know it won't- there are too many potential nominees out there already- he should garner and Oscar nomination, but I doubt it'll happen, unfortunately. The pain with which Ribisi imbues his character is quite powerful, and very eloquent.  All in all, I'd give it seven outta ten stars.",The Gift

Most people I've spoken to havent' seen this movie. I think Keanu did a fantastic job which is amazing since I can't stand him in almost everything he is in. Hillary Swank was amazing and that hair was perfect. I kept thinking I know this person while watching her. I got the feeling that Kinnear was sort of doing a walk through performance. He's done much better work. I couldn't help feeling Cate was too regal for this part. She did a much better job pulling off the blue color gal in Pushing Tin. Of course it was effective in making her seem out of her element. She's sort of ethereal in this film. Very entertaining and enthralling I highly recommend it.,The Gift
110,mikehamilton,Good Entertainment - Worth the Rental....,8,13 August 2001,"This story was pretty good.  Although, there are parts that are just too far fetched and a little too ""Hollywood"".  I don't know why directors and writers have to go off the track when making a movie.  I just don't understand this.  This movie had a lot going for it.  The acting was really good, lots of stars, a good script, and an interesting plot.  But they did stray a little too much away from the course of the quality film it started out as and eventually ended as.All in all, it was entertaining and I do recommend it.",The Gift
111,MissCzarChasm,A Few Faults Don't Ruin An Otherwise Good Movie,8,6 May 2002,"Sam Raimi is a very gifted director. Whether it's genre driven films such as the Evil Dead series or the recent Spider-Man he has a very good sense of the films he's making. Of his more serious recent films such as A Simple Plan and For the Love of the Game, I think The Gift, his last serious effort before Spider-Man, stands out as the best. The film has a few faults however so I just want to get those out of the way. Some of the characters aren't developed enough so we lose interest in them quite quickly. Also the outcome is quite obvious early on in the film, so a few more twist to maybe keep the audiences guessing would've been appreciated. Other than that however we have a pretty well made picture so these minor flaws don't overshadow an otherwise brilliant production. First and foremost this is a character driven piece lead by the incredible Cate Blanchet. She is quite the chameleon in her movies. She can go from playing Queen Elizabeth, to a southern fortune teller without skipping a beat. Her talent is something that most performers should strive for. She's very efficent in her part here. She's very likable and she makes you feel for her character. Giovanni Ribisi is also very good in the film. He could've played it like the stereotypical crazy person but he brings something new to the role. We feel for him because he brings his struggle across so well when he's on screen. Hillary Swank is good also but her character is majorly underdeveloped. She falls into stereotypical battered wife mode but I did like her performance. I just wish she was given more to do. Keanu Reeves was such a shock in this film I never took him seriously as an actor until I saw this. He literally scared me at certain moments in the film. He brings such a realistic intensity to the role that he becomes more frightening. Greg Kinnear is ok in this film His character suffers from lack of development as well. I'm also tired of him playing the nice guy in films. It's getting a little old. His southern accent also isn't very consistent. Kept coming in and out. It's hard for me to buy he and Katie Holmes as an item but I guess it worked for the filmmakers. Speaking of Katie Holmes, props to her for taking on a more adult role. *SPOILER. It's not even the fact that she shows us her breasts but it's the fact that she's playing against type and does it fairly well. She has minimal screentime but she makes an impression. Especially in her final scene of the film. *END SPOILER* Over-all I thought The Gift rose above the standard supernatural thriller. To me it's more a Character piece and fairly decent whodunit. I suggest you all see it because it's a really good film.",The Gift
112,JBLOSS,"Nothing new, nothing special",4,21 September 2001,I am not sure why such a strong cast signed up for this film. The story seems a mish-mash of other books/films. We have the psychic who tells fortunes but also has visions of the future and the past - so she can not only see into the future she also somehow sees events that happened in the past too...we have a no good mixed up misfit who comes good in the end - gee what a surprise!!! The twist is so obvious I can't think that it really is one. This is a sub standard attempt at a psychological thriller that offers nothing new to the genre. The psychic element doesn't ring true at all with a woman who could not foresee her own husbands death and cannot use the gift for her own purposes yet conveniently sees how someone is going to try and kill her. There are much better thrillers out there than this so don't waste your time with this one.,The Gift

The special effects illustrating Annie's gift are just right.  Not too much, not too little.  The plot is straightforward yet has enough unknowns to hold your attention, plus a nice little surprise at the end.I might not have taken the time to write a review of this film except that I felt I had to set the record straight, seeing that Maltin gave it 2.5 and Ebert 3 stars.  Three stars from Ebert is practically a snub, but if you read his review, you'll find its very positive, so I'm not sure what happened there.

115,diz-syd-63,A haunting and flawed thriller,8,19 April 2013,"For starters Cate Blanchett can do no wrong in my humble opinion, she's a very natural actor with an amazing ability to totally absorb the role she's playing.I found the story weak and some of the scenes incredibly predictable, the jump out and scare you moments, whilst only a handful are over done with sudden explosions of noise from the film's score. Totally un-needed as the tension works a wonderful solo.The cards she uses to get her 'visions' are weird - what are they. This, for me was the biggest weakness. They are an unnecessary prop, the character's psychic ability could very well stand on its own as visions and dreams.There's not badly cast person in this thriller, especially the three boys who their roles brilliantly, one wouldn't know they were acting. If you love Blanchett, you'll not be disappointed. Had it been a little tighter and not so strung out, I'd have given it a 10 - as it is, 8's a pretty good score I reckon.",The Gift

117,Peter Elefant,"Strange film, this one.",7,18 July 2001,"I saw this film, as the film I wanted to see, had stopped running. So I knew nothing about ""The Gift"", beforehand, which was sort of interesting. It seemed to be a thriller of some sorts, with.. hmm.. Cate Blanchett, alright, Giovanni Ribisi, interesting, Keanu Reeves, cool, Katie Holmes, sweet, Greg Kinnear, how about that... And then came the bad part: Partly written by Billy Bob Thornton.I've had many problems with that Thornton-character. He's made that ""Sling-blade"" feature, which I thought as very boring. The whole southern accent. The whole stupid people-theme. The whole wife-beating, incest-like, decadent life-sorta stuff, didn't do anything for me. So naturally I was concerned, when seeing his name in this one. And with good reason. This movie is, in many ways more of the same.It's a film about a psychic woman, who lives a small life in a small town, with her small children. She reads people futures for cash, and one day, she's asked to assist in a murdercase... And then it's good'ol' getthekillerbeforehegetsyou-fun. Entertaining at most, but nothing more. Well. That's how I see it, anyways.But. There's no reason for trashing what I don't like (Which are all of the above-parts), so let's talk about what makes this movie get a good 7.One of the main reasons are the actors, especially Cate Blanchett and Giovanni Ribisi. Giovanni the most, as he plays a tormented grown-up, full of repressed anger. He's perfectly cast, and he really makes you feel a deep sympathy, for this poor, under intelligent character that he plays. This is - indeed - something to admire.AND it is an alright psychological thriller. You get scared a couple of times, and there are moments in the film, who makes your palms moist.So overall a few good twists in this old fashioned ""whodoneit?""-flick, but the ending is predictable and that kind of ruins the show.7, which is viewable in my book, 2 of which points are won by Mr. Giovanni Ribisi. Interesting young man.",The Gift
118,FunnyMann,"Well-crafted, but...",6,10 September 2001,"""The Gift"" is a horror/suspense film that manages to entertain without being very suspenseful. Sam Raimi delivers a moody, appropriately creepy-looking piece of work, but the story's outcome, in my opinion, was never much in doubt. No problems with most of the cast. Some solid talent at work. Cate Blanchett plays a psychic card-reader, and she does all she can with what they handed her. But -- pun intended -- they didn't hand her a full deck of cards. Kudos to Keanu Reeves, though, for his stellar acting work here. No, of course not. I'm kidding. Reeves delivers yet another performance that makes you wonder if English is his first language. This guy has made a career delivering dialogue which he appears to be reading from phonetic cue cards.Two good reasons to watch this film. One, it does provide a few scares here and there. Two, Katie Holmes gets partially naked, which was an unexpected little bonus. ""The Gift"" isn't the type of movie you should rush out to rent. But if you happen across it on cable some aimless night, turn out the lights and give it a whirl. It may fall short in the suspense department, but trust me, you've seen worse. 6/10.",The Gift
119,Jeddia,Good but less than I'd expected,8,23 July 2001,"A strong cast and great director head up this thriller.  I rented the DVD after reading/hearing very little about the movie.  I was pleased with the film as a whole.  Great direction and the acting is superb.  Blanchet doesn't know how to act badly.  You can tell Reeves enjoyed his role as well though he was the hardest one to swallow...that isn't a knock, he did a good job, was just wierd seeing him act that way.  I'm convinced that Giovanni Ribisi (sp?) is one of the greatest younger actors in the industry right now.  And he seems underutilized in most cases (check out Private Ryan, Boiler Room, and a 3rd season episode of X Files that I don't recall the name of) because he's phenomenal.The only problem I had with this movie was that the plot became a bit transparent about halfway through.  It probably looked great on paper, but it was obvious (to me, at least) who the killer was by the time the first half of the movie had played out.  Then I was obviously expected to be shocked by the ending (which I was, but NOT because of who the killer turned out to be...).  Which is what was odd, the ending was really great even though I knew what I thought I knew ;)I give it 8 of 10.",The Gift
120,MundaneNoodle,predictable,6,13 August 2001,"I didn't buy into this one at all. I liked the start, but it just turned out to be a regular whodunit, with predictable results. One perk, Keanu Reeves was perfect as a moron. I don't think it was too much of a stretch for him. I am assuming the movie is set in swamp country, Louisiana, as they never make it quite clear where exactly the movie is supposed to take place. I will admit that I spent about 20 minutes guessing whodunit, but it wasn't that hard. Hollywood excels at making these polished, style-over-substance no-brainers. Throw in a well-known actor like Keanu Reeves, and a couple GOOD actors for balance, like Greg Kinnear and Cate Blanchet, a mediocre script and dialog, some polished and glossy cinemetography and the obligatory special effects and voila! Instant Hollywood formula blockbuster! If you want a real suspense ride, go rent something like Gorky Park (set it snowy Russia), you feel chilled watching it but at least it doesn't leave you cold like this movie.PS....Am I getting jaded?",The Gift

There's nothing wrong or bad with the film: Kinnear, Swank, Cole and Simmons' acting isn't horrible (Holmes is hardly in it, and Reeves is well, just Keanu Reeves with a beard); the directing isn'y terrible and even the characters and the dialogue works.

After a trial Reeves is convicted but Annie continues to have visions and we are then left with the question of who did do it.Although I worked out who it was before the end this did not spoil it for me.

126,madsmartinussen,Pick your horse Raimi,4,11 May 2021,"Here are 2 or 3 great movies wrapped around each other in 1 rather mediocre one. I assume the script is initially at fault, but a director of Raimis caliber should know to pick a direction, and stick with it to the end. Instead he chooses to focus equal attention on too many characters and too many plot lines, and all in rather short time. The result is we don't really get to care enough about any of the characters to care about the situations they're in. We care least about the murdered girl (played as awfully as ever by Katie Holmes), which is the first obvious mistake. We care nearly as little about her convicted murderer, but even less about her actual murderer, we don't care about the investigation, we don't care about the trial, we don't care about the supposed love triangle, in fact, we care very little about anything.What little we DO care about are Annie (Cate Blanchett) and her mentally unstable ""friend"" Buddy (Giovanni Ribisi). This is in great part due to the performances of both actors, each phenomenal in it's own way. Ribisi does a lot with what little he is given, and his story, and relationship to Annie is the first, and potentially greatest, film gone to waste here.There is a considerable depth to Buddys tragic story, that, along with Blanchetts psychic Annie, easily warrants a 2 hour picture, but instead it is left as a subplot, albeit the most interesting one.The second most interesting subplot, and the second best movie gone to waste as one, is the Annie vs Donnie vs Valerie story. In fact, this is the movie ""The Gift"" thinks it is, for the first 45 minutes of its runtime. The plot involves an abusive husband, his wife, and a psychic telling her to leave him. The husband finds out and starts harassing the psychic with increasing intensity, and on it could have gone into a potentially great thriller in the vein of ""Cape Fear"" or ""Fatal Attraction"". It doesn't, however.The third great film gone to waste, is what ""The Gift"" thinks it is in it's second 45 minutes, which is part murder investigation, part courtroom thriller. The psychic angle gives it an original twist, especially the dilemma a woman might end up finding herself in, if she lead detectives to a body on the property of the man who threatened her children, without an inch of tangible evidence. In a better film she might find herself the suspect of the murder, and of framing her enemy. In ""The Gift"" she doesn't, although she is somewhat ridiculed by the defense attorney.In the end the sum of all these parts add up to a sometimes intriguing, but mostly boring film, that ultimately wastes both its talent and potential.Raimi splits his focus and attention toward several different but equally capable horses, when he should have spent all his effort and talent on one. That would have given him a winner, instead he ends up with three losers, four if you count the audience.",The Gift
127,Twillhead,"Predictable Story, Wonderful Performances",9,3 November 2001,"The plot of ""The Gift"" is a curiously compelling mixture of human pathos and paranormality, albeit admittedly somewhat predictable. What makes this film interesting and noteworthy is: the beautiful southern backdrop, abrim with Spanish moss, full moons and photogenic bayous; the quietly matter-of-fact handling of one woman's extrasensory abilities; a sterling cast rising to the occasion by instilling a level of truth and integrity to their performances. Cate Blanchett, at the helm of this remarkable ensemble, is soft-spoken and restrained as Annie, whose 'gift' suddenly immerses her into the vortex of a dark and dangerous place, which she confronts with rectitude, compassion, and courage (arguably foolishly or not). Keanu Reeves is appropriately menacing and despicable as the villain of the piece (I'd be surprised if he didn't base his character on DeNiro in 'Cape Fear'), unleashing his rage most frequently on his hapless wife, portrayed by Hillary Swank with wide-eyed, bayou-backward conviction. Greg Kinnear, quickly becoming one of my favorite actors of this era, professionally fleshes out a somewhat thankless role with warmth and sad-eyed sincerity. That the victim of the story (lustily played by Katie Holmes) is a debutante-harlot seems somewhat misogynistic (the implication being that she got what she deserved), and it is my only real qualm with the movie. Most astonishing, however, is Giovanni Ribisi's amazing portrayal of the psychologically disturbed Buddy, who seeks advice and redemption from Annie, and whose torment and anguish in the face of his inner demons is palpable. It is a richly textured and heartbreaking performance, and should have certainly earned Ribisi an Oscar nomination. Mostly because of the script, 'The Gift' is not a great film, but earns high marks for sharp direction, superb acting, and lovely cinematography. And, oh yes . . . there are genuinely creepy moments that will chill and startle and leave your heart racing. But, significantly, those moments are not gratuitous, and are for the most part necessary to the story line. My rating--8 out of 10.",The Gift

The main character is a widow who is raising three young boys and is of modest means apparently due to her husband's death approximately one year prior. She receives small death benefit payments from the Social Security Administration and donations for her psychic readings which she provides as a service to her ""appointments"".Her character is impeccable, honest, caring, loving, understanding, forgiving, and conscientious.  She is called by one member of the community, ""The Soul of the town"".  The entire theme of the movie revolves around her.Some of the characters included in that revolvement are a victim of childhood sexual abuse and sadomasochism, an angry and rageful physical and mental abuser (tyrant), and a murderer.The main character is able to see into the past, present, and future and is an inter-dimensional individual who is strongly religious in nature but accused by some of the town's folk of being a Satanist and a witch.This movie can be considered an actual depiction of the lives of some people.  Cross dimensionality is also depicted in the movie on numerous occasions by three different individuals, the main character, the murder victim, the childhood sexual abuse victim, and on one occasion by one of the main character's grandmothers who she calls ""granny"".Individuals who are still in denial regarding their own behaviours probably will not care for the honesty in this film nor will those who are into ""formula"".The film's classification is ""fiction with a purpose"" - it teaches about real human lives and real human situations and circumstances as well as offering solutions to some of the dilemmas that human beings find themselves in.

I still don't know if I can ever forgive Mr. Reeves for his hideously bad southern accent in 'The Devil's Advocate'.  But, I grudgingly admit that he was on target with his performance as Donnie Barksdale.  You hated the little weasel, and you were supposed to.   Being from a small southern town, the characters in this film could've been my neighbors growing up.  Ms. Blanchett's performance was magnificent  - she didn't over or under do one single thing in even one of her scenes.  You had sympathy from her from the word go.  Hillary Swank WAS the (unfortunately) typical battered wife.The cinematography and editing of the film were at once strikingly familiar and goose-bump creepy.  Kudos to the director and crew.

Why so dim?,8,7 September 2015,"I enjoyed this movie (believe it or not) but I absolutely hated how passive and dim Cate Blanchett's character was.I became furious at how she just buckles to everything and everyone! She leaves things out of her testimony that could make her seem more credible, because she's nervous I guess, she cries and stands by while this crazy man burns up his dad, nobody calls the police and the list goes on, why does she keep reading for this man's wife who is clearly an idiot, and why does she always LIE during her readings. Whats the point in doing the readings and carrying on if you are just going to not tell people, or lie to them? I wonder how many deaths or bad things she could have prevented... Is there some rule that psychic's can't change the future by telling the truth?AND why does everyone think this lady can read minds??? She never said that or acted like she could.The dim witted behavior doesn't stop with her. When I tell my daughter to stay outside, that's what I mean. Why do her kids always seem to show up when she told them to stay away? I hate when writers try to drop that in for suspense. Isn't it bad enough she found the cards on the bed? Wouldn't have made a difference if the kids saw...I liked the twists and turns in the movie and I thought Giovanni Ribisi was brilliant, compared to everyone else. Keanu did a good job of acting mad and mean as hell, Katie Holmes played a pretty good slut and Hilary Swank, well, she wore the heck out of the mullet.I would recommend this movie but please be prepared to ignore a bunch of country bumpkin isms and idiots as you make your way through.",The Gift

The Cast is top rate, in particular Cate Blanchett who is on top form. Keanu Reeves even performs to the best of his (limited) ability, and if you look beyond what he has done in the past is a very menacing character indeed. 'The Gift' is the fine production that the similarly themed 'What Lies Beneath' could only dream of being.

138,craigboney,Enjoyable but predictable,5,14 March 2001,"*Some possible spoilers*I'd heard mixed reviews of this, but being a Sam Raimi fan (well, Evil Dead II+III and A Simple Plan..) I was intrigued enough to go along on a view of the trailer.  The story is good, although almost too plain to be gobsmacking.  Blanchett is fantastic as Annie Wilson, the widowed Psychic whose dreams give her (often horrific) insights into the future.  In fact the shining highlight of this movie is the way Raimi allows us to glimpse into Annie's mind, whilst she is trying to come to terms with the visions that present themselves to her.  Annie is wonderfully balanced, kind and level headed and selfless.  When a pillar of the community's sluttish daughter, Jessica King (played by Katie Holmes) goes missing, Annie is visited by the Police as a last resort. She leads them via a dream she has the night after they visit to where her corpse lies in a pond..soon it seems justice has been done, but Annie, via another dream, is convinced that this is not the case.  The finale is frantic, but in my view, there was only ever one person who was logically the real killer.. That was the main disappointment.  Despite an American Beauty style ""oh no..it's too obvious..let's quickly implicate everyone just before the killer's identity is revealed"" sequence, there is only momentary doubt with regard to the identity of the guilty party.

Some people are complaining about plot holes, just ignore that, there may be some minor plot holes but they didn't take away from the fun of this move.It's not really a horror movie at all, kind of a ghost movie, and there are some jump-scares. Those were fun too.I was skeptical that Keanu Reeves could pull off the part of a nasty wife-beating hillbilly, but he really did a good job! You could hardly recognize him. Maybe he's a good actor after all. The only place he started looking like the normal Keanu Reeves was in the court scenes, I guess without all the hillbilly clothes it's harder to project that image.Some people said they guessed the murderer, I had suspicions but I was never really sure. In fact I settled on the wrong person. They put a few false clues out there to throw you off the track.The part of the mentally disturbed Buddy Cole is played beautifully by Giovanni Ribisi. Wait until you find out what the ""blue diamond"" is all about...! Overall the acting was great, it really got me ""into"" the movie, into the feel of living in that little town.A lot of horrifying, disturbing parts, not for the kids! I gave it 8 out of 10. If I felt like I hadn't wasted my time, it gets at least a 6. This one I even watched a second time with my wife. Normally a multiple-watch movie would get a 9 or 10 from me, but it didn't quite make it, close though...",The Gift

She is superb, so is Keanu (strange, maybe he can act?).Cate is a card reader who is involved in a murder mystery.

141,seanahalpin,Who'd live in the deep South?,9,18 May 2002,"Let's leave the supernatural to one side for a second - as an Australian watching this film, I want to know: ""Who would want to live in the deep South?"" I have never seen such a bunch of toothless hicks and cousin marrying hillbillies as in this spooky film. The scariest things were the local yokels rather than the ""gift"" itself.I felt that this movie was excellent. A few surprises and, of course, brilliant acting from Cate Blanchett. Keanu Reeves also impressed as the wife basher. The physical settings were atmospheric, and the whole thing worked very well.One question I would ask is, would it have been so good if Cate hadn't played Annie? I doubt it. I could see that this film, without strong actors, may have been typical 'made for video' fodder. But Cate and the other actors brought that ""something extra"" to the film - that is their gift.",The Gift
142,sim-richmond,"Appears Natural, Affrights Natural",8,30 April 2013,"First of all, I would like to express how much I liked the movie soon after I've done watching it. The scene-switching goofs and errors aren't enough to destroy the whole of the film.I like the entire concept of having a crime which was witnessed by a person who wasn't even in the crime scene but witnessed it through her dreams and visions.Despite the fact that movies featuring extrasensory perception of a character is not very unique, what makes this movie really crafted is the great talent of its producers to create an ambiance of mystery without the need of making mainstream plots like having deaths caused by ghosts or monsters haunting for justice.I also liked that they were able to portray spooky scenes without using heavy prosthetic make-up and with just a little of computer generated effects. It made everything appear natural and affright natural.Furthermore, I know that the ending wasn't that perfect. There seem to be many aspects in the story left behind leaving the viewers ask: what happened to this and that. However, I don't know why I enjoy the ending that much (and that is how an ending should be, enjoyed by the viewers).The screen portrayal of nearly all individuals was quite good and that ain't surprising 'cause they all are awarded by different awarding bodies.The over exposure of the trees however, is I believe, something that is not needed because it just kills the runtime. The time occupied by showing the trees should have been used for something else that contributes to the development of frighten from the audience and development of the plot, as well.Overall, I'd give it a score of 8 out of 10. Great job.",The Gift

145,jacob rosen,Lackluster,5,5 January 2002,"Sam Raimi's mix of Southern gothic melodrama and supernatural mind games is superior to his last thriller `A Simple Plan', but still nowhere near his masterpiece, the classic `Darkman', where his love of the Universal horror films of the thirties was the primary motivator. Cate Blanchett stars as a medium in a small Georgia town who becomes involved in the murder of a socialite (Katie Holmes) and must deal with the perceptions of the townsfolk. Raimi never gets enough of a dynamic rhythm going and the film seems both limp and tired; the predictable screenplay by Billy Bob Thornton and Tom Epperson seems to have been created after reading one too many Stephen King novels. The only real pleasure is watching Keanu Reeves try again to play against type as a villain and he's more effective this time than he was in `The Watcher'.",The Gift

A wonderful cast. A beautiful setting in the GA bayous. This is a well written script. Some parts are slow, and the plot I found somewhat predictable, but overall the story is captivating.
Cate Blanchett gives an unforgettable performance as Annie. Giovanni Ribisi is well cast as Buddy and gives a stellar performance.
The music soundtrack is poignant and fits the story well.

The cast itself actually is good/bordering on great, and the actors do their best with the material, but the material is the issue. The story itself is trite, the murder is easily solvable, and the ""surprise"" at the end made me actually laugh out loud (I'm assuming that was *not* the response the director hoped to elicit). Bonus points for Blanchett's ""tarot cards"" coming straight out of Ghostbusters, though (wish I could attach a pic, they're hilarious - not actual tarot cards, they're legit cards with pics of just squiggly lines, stars, circles etc).",The Gift
149,sgreenwa,"Good, Not Great",7,27 January 2001,"As my fiance mentioned to me, the movie keeps your interest the entire way through, which today with the state of movies being made, is an accomplishment, though I am sad to admit that. The performances are good, specifically Blanchett and Ribisi. Giovanni is one extraordinary talent and he demonstrates it here. He has a tremendous range in what he can accomplish. Blanchett is solid as the lead. While she does not stretch her talent here, she does what is necessary. Reeves, Swank and Kinnear all accomplish what you expect. This is a creative movie and there is solid tension, HOWEVER the climax is FAR to easy to predict and they give away the killer too easily, leaving little to the imagination. This movie was in desperate need of a twist at the end and it was never there, which took this move from very good to just good. Worth seeing,  but nothing to write home about.",The Gift
150,Tim Gomersall,What a pointless film.,3,15 March 2001,"I normally only comment on films I've enjoyed, but I'm making an exception for this one. Although some critics had their reservations about the film, it seemed to me that most billed it as this year's Sixth Sense, and were piling quoteable praise on it.I suppose we should take one thing only from this; never trust the critics.It was slow, dull, filled to bursting point with caricature actors thinking they were character actors and directed with a lack of enthusiasm I find surprising from a man who can make the third film in a zombie franchise seem fresh. Billy Bob Thornton can't write, Keanu Reeves can't be menacing, and Katie Holmes can't be slutty, but that didn't stop all three giving it their best shot.I suppose I'm mainly surprised by the overall positive response this film received. Compared to 'What Lies Beneath' this film is poor. Compared to 'The Sixth Sense' this film is dire, especially when it reaches it's conclusion and decides it had better try and throw in a twist which falls flat on its out-of-the-blue-and-completely-pointless face. Ending of 'The Sixth Sense': ""Coooool!"". Ending of 'The Gift': ""So what? What do I care? You mean that the entire pointless sub-plot was just so they could set up that hokey micro-twist? I don't care"".For a thriller it was slow, for a supernatural chiller it's chills were few and far between (although the visions were often visually compelling) and for an expensive film with a big-name cast it looks cheap and amateurish, and no I'm not just talking about the deliberately run-down back-water look to the sets.Don't see it. It's absolutely mediocre.",The Gift
151,Jen_UK,Cate Blanchett is mesmerising!,8,10 June 2002,"'The Gift' is an understated, underrated thriller which succeeds in captivating one's attentions from beginning to end. The film's main strengths are its screenplay, its beautiful mise-en-scene, a strong ensemble cast and a haunting soundtrack (those of you who enjoyed 'The Shipping News' will recognise the composer from the lilting score of that film)
But perhaps 'The Gift's' main attribute is the presence of the wonderful Cate Blanchett. Although I loved the film, I was forced to wonder if in the hands of a less capable actress, whether it would have had the same captivating power. Somehow I think not. Cate Blanchett's restrained portrayal of Annie exudes compassion and tenderness, and is integral to the success of the film as a whole. Her sensitivity as an actress is important in relation to the subject matter - ESP and the occult - as these areas generally attract much scepticism. Blanchett, through her unique skill as an actress, manages to make the more fantastical elements of the story not only plausible, but intensely moving. She is luminous to watch, reminding me of the (also magnificent) Meryl Streep in terms of her quiet beauty, her range of expression and her adept skill at accent mimicry. Who could believe that she is Australian?In short, 'The Gift' is well worth seeing, primarily for Cate Blanchett, but also for the supporting actors Keanu Reeves (very impressive and effective) Hilary Swank (underused) and the magnificent Giovanni Ribisi - who is both explosive and reticent as Buddy Cole. Also demanding attention is the imaginative screenplay, and the hauting beauty of the mise-en-scene which manages to be both beautiful and eerie at the same time. Overall, 'The Gift' is a resounding success, due mainly to the heart of the film - Cate Blanchett's resonant performance. The actress has a unique gift herself, which richly deserves to be seen by many.",The Gift

Sometimes in movies I get anxious and aggravated bc I'm like OMG why are you doing that!!! It drives me freakin crazy the stupid things people do in movies and I just can not relate to them! That was NOT the case in this movie tho. Except for Hilary swank of course lol, did stupid things i mean, but she really played her role great too, it was funny seeing her like that, but cate blanchett did an amazing performance! She really rocked hers! I mean if she didn't win an award for this role she definitely should have. Only one thing I will say, while it was great and interesting she played off the psychic thing so well that it wasn't creepy it just seemed believable and normal. Idk if that's a good thing or not because I wasn't scared, but I was intrigued and on edge of my seat the whole time. If you want an all around great involved movie well after by everyone in it then this is for you. I think anyone would enjoy this actually, I can't see why anyone would have anything negative besides it could've been a little more scary but it made up for that by being so well ended.

155,Han-10,Solid but slow; it doesn't offer itself to repeat viewings,7,29 July 2001,"Let's first say what's good about ""The Gift."" It's well-directed by Sam Raimi with a similar quiet grace he used in ""A Simple Plan.""  Plus, he managed to get great performances from all of his actors, even the ones who haven't been so great in films past.  I have to admit, I'd like to see Raimi get back to his roots.  The ""Evil Dead"" films treated us with scene after scene of relentless creativity.  While there's nothing I'd necessarily criticize about his style in ""The Gift,"" I hope to see Raimi return to above-and-beyond mode for ""Spiderman.""As I mentioned, the acting is strong.  Cate Blanchett is the shining star here.  If there ever is a time when we don't believe her, it is more the script's fault than her own.  Giovanni Ribisi does a fine job as does Keanu Reeves most of the time (it's one of his few tolerable roles).  Greg Kinnear is mis-cast.  He should stick to smarmy, sarcastic roles (he generated half of the few laughs in ""What Planet Are You From?"") and stay away from any roles that require a Southern accent.And now for the not-so-good. I don't want to say that the writing is bad, but it's not great.  The story is a good one, but it's slowly paced and can be predictable at times. Worse, there are times when you start to not care ""whodunit"" and hope for the quick arrival and passing of the inevitable scene where the villain explains his/her motives for the crime to the protagonist before the final battle ensues.  Luckily, there are some carefully interwoven threads that offer some powerful moments and one particularly nice twist.  Whether you have the patience to wait for the threads to converge is up to you.  Usually I'd blame bad pacing on the director, but I really think most of the fault lies within the script.One last note:  This film has its fair share of dream sequences.  They are necessary as plot points, but I've become so familiar with the standard Hollywood dream sequence that I could just about cue every picture edit, sound effect, and music crescendo from my couch.  For God's sake, somebody figure out a different way to pull this off!Grade: C+",The Gift

Keanu Reeves probably does the best acting job, when you take into account his acting potential and weigh it against his actual performance, I mean.  We know these other people can do a good job, as they have done so in the past.  Keanu, though I can't say I have one solitary thing against him in any real personal sense, has never really done a good job at too many things.  So, given that I was properly sort of scared at his portrayal of an abusive redneck husband, then kudos to you, Keanu Reeves!  Oh yeah, the movie:  It's boring!  We get to see Giovanni Ribisi (""My Two Dads"") reprise his beloved role of ""Daniel"" from ""The Other Sister"", though, so I guess all is not lost.",The Gift
157,TheMara61,One strong self confidence movie,10,26 May 2012,"This movie might be in my top-ten not to see comfortable in my bed, on a rainy afternoon. Usually, I like to see hard action movies on the great screen of a theater, and psychological drama movies alone, at home, advertising the family not to disturb. Well, in fact ""The Gift"" works both ways, and I feel the need to give all my credits and respect to the writers, the director, the whole actors team. Cate Blanchett was amazing from the first scene up to the end. Her performance has been awesome, as the neurotic single mother of three, her gift necessarily to make a living, yet social controversial. At some point, one could see her eyes's injected like after crying a lot, is this possible to be ""a special effect"", I wonder: yes, but ingenious. Keanu Reeves, one of the most controversial stars of all times, has constructed here an unbelievable role of a rude, brutal, huge, abusing husband versus the kiddo ""knock, knock"" looks as Neo, a year before. My respects here. The feelings of being unsecured, trapped transcends and catches the viewers. (This is what I have felt). The whole atmosphere was genial realized, like in a black and white old movie, but the end where in the cemetery, one can feels peace and mild autumn colors. While by 3/4 section movie you can guess that Donnie is not the killer and you keep for yourself the ""disappointing"" relationship with the movie, the switch on scene when Buddie Cole coming back to the rescue,the policeman saying that he was dead was also a great or ingenious ideas. Well, I have just said that the movie connects with the auditorium. That is very rare. Tremendous feeling. I have rated this movie 10 from 10, I do not feel the need to take a star or two. My only fancy question raises like that: why Keannu Reeves has felt right to perform two ""bad guy"" roles after the huge success in the Matrix, knowing there will be another Matrix -es? I mean ""The Watcher"" and this ""The Gift"". Has this superstar felt the need to indulge himself loosing fans... cause the bad guys's characters could dangerously decline a ""Speed"" or a ""Matrix"" career of the usually's Keannu Reeves positively heroes.

I thought the movie had a very strong plot (which is what most are saying it doesn't have)  I really liked the story that was written (By Billy Bob at best, which I didn't know until I seen the movie) and the acting was par none.  I even liked Keanu Reeves. That sames something because I think he's the worst actor on the face of the planet... behind Stephen Seagul that is. It's probably because I'm a HUGE fan of thrillers that I liked this movie so much.  I just love when a movie keeps you guessing.  This movie did that well.  It introduced all the characters and then made you believe that every single one of them could have been the criminal.  Very well done.

This movie will probably be remembered as the movie that ""america's little girl"" showed her breasts. Was it necessary? NO. Did it add to the movie as a whole? slightly, but not much. Was Katie Holms victim to bad casting once again... MOST DEFINATELY! If she was looking for attention she got it, tons of teens flocked to the movie expecting to see her topless. She should have just done playboy if that was her intention, it would have accomplished more... I think. And I guess I wouldn't be a critic without reporting that Katie's Breasts got a 9 (out of 10) on Pete's Breast Rating. But it still wasn't worth it!But enough about Katie and her breasts, lets talk about the movie. Sam Raimi did a great job directing, but the story just wasn't there. What made up for it was how well the characters were written. Billy Bob Thorton deserves a lot of credit for this script... the characters themselves save the movie from being just another suspense flick. The camera angles were good, hey its Raimi, but it was lacking something. May-be Spiderman was on Raimi's mind.Overall I liked the movie, mostly for the direction, characters, and performances. And speaking of performances... Keanu Reeves deserves a boat load of credit for his acting job during this flick.

Raimi is a really good director and he knows how to respect and appreciate the actors in his films. I read Tarot cards myself, and I do have some ""gifts"" given from my grandmother but I don't have visions, my dreams are what I base some future decisions on.

162,TrickyTheHorrorFreak,A good horror / thriller with some great performances.,8,4 December 2006,"""The Gift"" was a pleasant surprise for me. On reading the plot, my hopes for the movie were not particularly high. The main reason for this was due to the whole story revolving around the main character's abilities as a fortune teller. I've always seen this as a rather bad storytelling device, mainly due to so many recent movies utilizing ""visions"" and ""clairvoyance"" to allow characters to know things that the writers can see no other way of expressing to the audience. Check out ""Jeepers Creepers 2"" for a perfect example. The creators were struggling to let the audience know the history of the creature involved, so instead of figuring out an ingenious way to do so, one of the cheerleaders suddenly starts to have flashbacks and visions for no obvious reason. Anyway, seeing that Sam Raimi, the director of the cult ""Evil Dead"" series and more recently the ""Spider Man"" movies was at the helm for ""The Gift"", I thought I'd give it a shot despite my concerns.When a young woman (played by a very sultry Katie Holmes) disappears, the police are baffled as to what has happened to her. In desperation, they grudgingly seek advice from the town clairvoyant Annie (wonderfully portrayed by the extremely talented Cate Blanchett). With the help of her psychic powers, Annie leads the police to the property of Donnie Barkwell (Keanu Reeves in a surprisingly cast role). But is Donnie a killer? And can Annie's evidence against him hold up considering its psychic origin? There are a few things that make this movie work. Firstly, the acting is mostly superb. Cate Blanchett is just staggering as Annie. I mentioned earlier how difficult it is to use psychic phenomena as a plot builder, and it takes a seriously talented actor to be able to pull it off. Cate's performance is completely believable, which is just as well, as the whole movie depends on it. Besides Blanchett, Greg Kinnear, Giovanni Ribisi, Hilary Swank and Katie Holmes all put in good performances. But Keanu Reeves is the surprise packet for me. I know he can act when given a role that allows him to do so. ""The Devil's Advocate"" showcased his abilities to some extent. But I never would have thought he could ever play a villain role, or in this case, a dangerous tough-guy redneck. While he's nowhere near as impressive as the movie's star, he puts in a dominant performance with the help of good direction.Speaking of direction, Sam Raimi does an awesome job crafting a tight thriller with supernatural and horror elements. His dabbling experience in different genres is really paying off now with an ability to pull A list actors and still make movies designed to creep you out and scratch your head in equal doses. ""The Gift"" is a really enjoyable horror themed thriller that will keep you glued to your seat. If it wasn't for the highly dubious climax (which I won't give away here except to say that it pushes the boundaries of what the audience should be willing to except) and the occasional cliché characters (the police are always idiots in these films), I'd give this even higher marks.",The Gift

This movie is a pretty good example of it. Basically, a fortune teller tries to solve the murder of a young woman using her ""Gift"" for seeing future and past events. So, they didn't add anything significant to the genre- but at least it was effective.  Cate Blanchette was awesome, and Keanu Reeves was all but recognizable as 'stereotypical redneck.' I think a lot about the success of the movie is that it keeps the audience interested in the story by being a mystery, ornamented with scares and 'visions.'

The movie started out a bit slower than usual, but I was guessing that the filmmaker really wanted to give you a back story to each of the introduced characters. There are characters that you love, and then there is Reeves character that you hate almost from his introduction. But, if you think about this character, there is one in every town and city all across the world. The abusive type that bullies everyone in his path. You cheer when something bad happens to him, but then kinda rethink your decision about 10 minutes later. In the story line, you think one character is a certain way, then they reveal a whole new side of them that you were not expecting. The film has plenty of action and drama.

166,Funk Doctor,Disappointing,4,9 August 2001,"Sam Raimi is most certainly one of the most influential directors of the eighties. With ""A simple plan"" he proved that he isn´t only a master of the visual side of filmmaking, but also an actor-director. Now, with ""The gift"" he returns to the character-drama and, again, he works together with Billy Bob Thornton, who wrote the script. ""The gift"" deals with a single mother, living in the swamps somewhere in the south of the US. She has the ability to ""see"" things, so she earns her money as a clairvoyant. No wonder that the rednecks living in her town scream ""witch"" when she foresees a gruesome murder... This story doesn´t seem to be too original and Sam Raimi´s direction doesn´t do anything to change that. He focuses on his actors, which give good performances, especially Cate Blanchett and Keanu Reeves as a wife-beating redneck, but they cannot change the fact, that we have seen this many, many times before.

169,myyellowbutt,tolerable,6,7 August 2001,"Sometimes movies can throw you this way and that, keep you guessing from start to finish.  This is not one of those occasions.  This is more on the lines of trying to lead you in several different directions, but you end up exactly where you thought you were going.  Any attempts to make this  a mystery were lost when it's obvious who the killer is not too long into the movie.Now let me say I'm NOT saying this is a bad movie.  It's fairly entertaining.  Although that's mostly due to a few good performances on the part of the above average cast present here.  Blanchet was good as usual, as was Kinear.  Although the best performance in the film by far was Ribisi. He shows yet again how much of a future he's got in the industry.All in all, I'm giving this movie about 6/10.

172,cinswan,The Gift is honest and true in the most amazing ways. The ensemble cast is superb in bringing the story to the screen.,10,8 June 2016,"I can say from my experience as a psychic that Billy Bob Thornton makes the psychic's life believably real – and Sam Raimi's directing along with Cate Blanchett's portrayal of Annie Wilson come together to seal the deal. Blanchett brings to Wilson's character understated grace and humility. When put in the position of having to use her gift to bring the murder of a local young woman (Katie Holmes) to the authorities' attention she reveals the burden of The Gift. It's a double entendre and cautionary tale wrapped in a two word title.Hilary Swank's portrayal of Valerie Barksdale, a battered wife who seeks Wilson's aid is familiar to anyone who has witnessed spousal abuse. She captures that inexplicable dichotomy of the abused's recognition of her dire situation: she loves him, fears him, yet fears being alone even more. What Keanu Reeves (Donnie Barksdale) brings to the role a quality that some have said he doesn't achieve as an actor: realism. I have known a man like this and have no reason to ever know one again. There is nothing for me to learn on that road, yet I know others who have yet to learn that soul-sucking lesson. Reeves' evocation of anger, disdain, bullying and taunting all mistaken for indisputable power is true to the abuser's persona. What he tapped into when bringing this character to life is neither affectation nor caricature. The role reveals an unparalleled collaboration between him, Sam Raimi, and Billy Bob Thornton to be nakedly honest about cruelty. Reeves' interaction with Giovanni Ribisi in his role as Buddy Cole, another client of Wilson's who challenges Donnie Barksdale to shoot him, is particularly chilling. Anyone who has ever dealt with spousal abuse, regardless of what one thinks about psychic abilities, needs to see this movie.The plot twists in predictable yet also surprising directions. What transpires will raise questions about reality as we know it, and how life isn't as certain as we might want to believe it is. Even psychic Annie Wilson learns from the ever-skeptical sheriff (J.K. Simmons) that what she thought was real was real – but in a different, inexplicable way.

177,0rbita1,Slightly eerie and mildly entertaining 'Sixth Sense'-type thriller.,6,10 July 2001,"Yet another 'Sixth Sense' clone hits the screens and, unsurprisingly, fails to live up to its illustrious predecessor. Annie (Blanchett) is a small town psychic who, when widowed a year before the events in the film, provides for her three children by using her psychic talents to perform 'readings' for the neighbourhood. Yet when her visions lead to local bad-boy Donnie Barkside (Reeves) becoming chief suspect in a murder investigation, she wonders whether he really is the guilty party...As predictable as this sounds (and yes, it turns out to be as predictable as it sounds), 'The Gift' is still a respectable addition to the genre. Blanchett adds a strength and depth to her character lacking from many others in the film, while even Keanu 'Wood' Reeves is surprisingly animated up to his normal stump-like performances. The atmosphere is suitably eerie in places, and there are even a few 'seat-jumping' moments for good measure. Yet the film simply takes way too long to get going and, when it does, is frequently pulled back into a sea of melodramatic nonsense. It has its moments, the end is great (if predictable), and is moderately entertaining - just make sure the backlight on your watch is working, ok?6/10",The Gift

But somewhere in the course of the story, the film seems to lose its pace. Annie has dreams and visions of the murdered woman's corpse and whereabouts, which are supposedly meant to be shocking and frightening, but most of the time they are just silly and annoying. Hilary Swank is utterly bad and unwatchable in a very passive and uninteresting role, you wonder why she agreed to play such a character after her Oscar win that year. And the last third is so unbearably predictable, it's completely unbelievable, that Annie does not realize the situation, especially when she is assumed to have that special gift. Really stupid! And very, very shallow and superficial.If it was not for Cate Blanchett's engaging performance, I would give this movie a much lower rating than 5 out of 10.",The Gift
179,superjaneyjane,A mediocre daytime movie elevated by a (mostly) excellent cast.,3,15 May 2007,"Billy Bob Thornton won an Oscar for his 'Sling Blade' screenplay. Halle Berry is proof enough that this doesn't make you immune to mediocrity (Gothika) or all-out awfulness (Catwoman), but the lesson to be learned here is that lightning doesn't strike twice.Though 'The Gift', like 'Sling Blade', follows the Southern Gothic conventions, and explores some pretty dark themes, such as familial abuse and mental illness, the mystery element of the film is so clumsily executed that it undermines the more interesting and effective drama of the piece. I'm not actually sure if I found it so easy to identify with clairvoyant Annie (Cate Blanchett), because she was a well-written character or because I was also able to make accurate predictions, not only about the correct identity of the killer, but the entire narrative structure of the film within the first five minutes. By the time the principle cast have all been introduced, you will know who will be offed, who will be wrongfully accused of said offing and who actually did the offing. So if you insist on actual 'mystery', steer clear. That said, the film has redeeming features, mostly to do with the cast. Cate Blanchett is brilliant as always as Annie, imbuing the character with a quiet dignity as she is repeatedly mocked and sneered at for her gift. Matching her is Giovanni Ribisi as her tragically disturbed friend Buddy. The scene in which he avenges himself upon an abuser is truly sickening. Ribisi is an extremely versatile actor and handles the intensity of his character. Rounding out the stand-out performances is an actor not generally known for his versatility or intensity: Keanu Reeves. While he usually appears as a somewhat animated piece of cardboard, as the repulsive wife-beater Donnie, Reeves is on terrifying form. Intimidating not only to the other characters but to the audience, Reeves method seems to be: when he's bad, he's very very good; when he's good he's wooden. Hilary Swank is effectively pathetic as his down-trodden wife, but, this being the deep south, Swank is saddled with a hilariously awful she-mullet wig, so bad that no degree of pathos can transcend the unintentional comedy. Despite a quartet of excellent performances, it's thanks to Dawson's Creeker Katie Holmes that this film is remembered. Referenced in 'Harold and Kumar', Holmes does indeed bare her chest. Given her overzealous southern accent and rather poor attempt to add depth to the 'village bicycle', Holmes should be thankful that this is the only thing people can remember about her role in this film. Greg Kinnear should also be thankful, as he is incredibly bland in this film, which is strange given that he is usually quite engaging. But this thankless, underwritten role is overshadowed by the other characters.What makes this film so disappointing is the quality of the actors involved; they all deserve better than this. Particularly Reeves, who wasted a rare, excellent performance on such mediocrity.",The Gift

He was really convincing as serial lover and wife beater.I just wished they showed more of Donnie's 'loverboy' side.  If he was the best **** in town, then why didn't they show us...LOL.  It kinda made his character too one-sided.I thought Giovanni Ribisi did an outstanding job as the troubled car-mechanic Buddy Cole.  He gave the character just the right amount of un-hingedness required for someone who has lead a terrible life of abuse.Cate Blanchett made a good 'fortune teller' as Annie Wilson.  She gave a great humility to the character as if she was scared of her abilities, but used them for good.Well, that's all I want to write right now.Also, the soundtrack is very very good.

184,intuitive7,A Story Ripped from Billy Bob's Own Life,8,28 December 2002,"""The Gift"" isn't a thriller in the pure sense, but fans of ""Slingblade""or ""A Simple Plan"" won't be disappointed.  This Billy Bob film is superior to both, largely due to his screenplay and Blanchett's extraordinary performance. Those following Billy Bob know his own mother had the gift and was a locally active psychic when he was growing up. So the caring and firsthand knowledge he's written into his characters give ""The Gift"" authenticity and charge. His plot lacks the unpredictability of thrillers like ""House of Games"" or ""Sixth Sense"", but what it lacks in surprise, it makes up for in depth. Its on screen power comes from Raimi, Thornton and Blanchett's detailed observation of Annie as a widowed mother of three making ends meet by doing readings. There's such a transcendent yet maternal tenderness imparted by Cate Blanchett to her role that when Annie's home and kids are breached, you feel it in your gut. If you want to see an actress who completely understands her character, watch Blanchett in this. Her performance is comparable to Gillian Anderson's performance in ""House of Mirth"" or Streep's in ""Sophie's Choice"". I became deeply involved in Annie's ordinary yet extraordinary life and, through her, became involved with the characters around her.Giovanni Ribisi explodes as Buddy, and the usually flat Keanu Reeves provides the right physical menace as Swank's out-of-control redneck husband, Donnie. The rest of the cast measure up well with Hillary Swank, Greg Kinnear and Michael Jeter standing out. The climax stretches credibility a bit, but the twist at the end will touch you. Yes, you'll respond to Raimi's usual thriller moments, but it's the degree to which you care for the characters, and the time and care taken by the director, writers and cast to accomplish this that are the film's great achievements. Don't miss it, if only to see Cate Blanchett at the top of her game.",The Gift
185,ariesjow,Cate never fails to amaze me...even amongst a loaded cast,8,29 January 2001,"We all know what a hidden gem Cate Blanchett is to the film community. She proves herself yet again in this film. Why it may not fall into one of the best films of the year, it is definitely one of the best acted I've seen so far. Cate Blanchett decided to show her flexibility once again( its a shame she didn't get more recognition for her brilliant performance in Talented Mr. Ripley). The shock of this film however lies in Giovanni Ribisi. I admit to paying little attention to him before...but this was quite showy role for him. Oscar worthy? Most definitely but its doubtful he will be nominated. Hillary Swank made a wise decision in her role also. It took me a while to settle down and realize it was her with long hair. Katie Holmes ventures into a brave new world with this one. I wish we could have seen more of Rosemary Harris. Her skills never fail to amaze me. Kinnear also did a great job. I was least impressed with keanu Reeves. I don't know what it is about Keanu. It just seems like despite his role, he always seems to throw off that Bill and Ted appearance to me. I'm doubtful that he will ever shrug it off. Overall, great effort by Billy Bob Thornton. This movie proves that casting sometimes can make or break a film. I gave it an 8!",The Gift
186,long_christopher,Psychic Prejudice,7,3 May 2004,"Annabelle 'Annie' Wilson (Cate Blanchett) is a small-town psychic who is asked to help in an investigation into the disappearance of a young girl, Jessica (Katie Holmes).  However, Annie's powers cause her to be unjustly implicated in the disappearance.The title of the film 'The Gift' is representative of Annie's psychic abilities.  The main theme of the film is psychic ability and how it reflects the prejudice felt by people towards those who appear to be different to themselves.The strength of this film is in the acting and editing.  The acting of both Cate Blanchett (Annie) and Katie Holmes (Jessica) was at all times believable and made the audience empathise with their on-screen personas. The editing is memorable particularly in its use of graphic matches, flashbacks and sound bridges.  A striking example of a graphic match occurs when the camera shows Annie brushing her hand across the page of a photograph album, before cutting to a shot of her brushing her hand across the surface of a gravestone. Flashbacks occur frequently throughout the narrative, as depicted in the court room scenes where the lawyers are cross examining witnesses who are recalling the last time they had seen Jessica. Sound bridges are also used in this scene.In 'The Gift', past and present often merge in order to propel the narrative forward.  An example of this occurs when Annie is hanging up a sheet through which she sees the figure of a dead relative. This sheet is symbolic of a mist between past and present.The mise-en-scene includes a visual motif in the form of tarot cards which are used by Annie to aid her readings. These tarot cards not only help to remind the audience of Annie's gift but also reflect the prejudice felt by the town's residents.  This is illustrated when Annie returns home and the cards have been used to spell the word Satan on her bed.The camerawork helps to reinforce the visual motif by use of wide shots and high angles.  A high angle is used in the scene where the tarot cards are lying on the bed.  Dissolves are also used to reinforce the psychic theme in the film.  An example is when Annie is asleep on the bed and in her dream an image of the tarot cards appear over her face.The sound in this film is atmospheric and is used to great effect to promote suspense within the audience.  In a scene when Annie suspects that somebody is in her house the only diegetic sound that the audience could hear was her heartbeat.  In conclusion, this film has a well constructed narrative as a result of good editing and particularly strong performances by Cate Blanchett and Katie Holmes.In my opinion the message of 'The Gift' is that you should resist condemning someone and always keep an open mind, whether you are prejudiced towards others because of their psychic abilities or whether you have any other form of prejudice.8/10",The Gift

""The Gift"" also has a winning cast, and characters that are not the ""villain bait"" the horror genre all too commonly employs.

Every actor has a moment to shine, but the real revelation here is Keanu Reeves as an bearded, abusive redneck. His performance makes you forget the Bill and Ted surfer dude or the buff Speed action hero. He's bluntly evil.

It's actually subtle, which is a hard thing for that director. The story is spooky and well paced, even if mildly predictable. And perhaps most importantly the entire cast is not only well chosen, but each puts in a very good performance (yes! even Keanu Reeves is actually acting in this movie, I know that's hard to believe but it's true).

She manages to make her character and her issues beievable. possibly one of her best movie preformances to date. Giovani also has a great role. His scenes are just hard to watch and yet you cnat manage to draw yourself away from the screen Reeves is also great as Donnie. He somehow manages to strike fear into you at certain parts. Although sometime it seem a bit too much. Holmes, act as the missing child is played well. She also does a topless scene (Im beging to think all Raimi films has soem form of nudity in them) Finally Raimis work brings the screen alive.*SPOILERS* I will note state what will happen at the end but it does seem like a disapointment to such a great film to be stuck with a teen-horror film ending.Finall great movie must see 9/10",The Gift
203,Tompson,As intense as it gets,10,9 December 2001,"The level of acting and intensity of the key scenes are something that very rarely comes by. The supernatural aspect is brilliantly disguised by excellent performances of the cast and a well-written STORY, not a series of individual acts. The gift proves that a script for a good thriller is not built on an implausible plot twist. Before the ending, this story has totally established itself already and the 'whodunnit' is just sugar on top. Top three of the year, IMO.",The Gift
204,TSWolf-2,"""What Lies Beneath"" with a soul...",9,3 January 2001,"A great psychological character study with supernatural overtones, this film builds a vivid and oppressive atmosphere, thanks largely to a deftly-layered performance from Cate Blanchett, and supported by strong three-dimensional characters.

205,brianh-7,"Excellent cast, mediocre story",6,13 November 2001,"(questions posed below should be considered spoilers)First, the performances from Cate Blanchett, Giovanni Ribisi, and even Keanu were excellent.  Giovanni's character, Buddy Cole, was the most interesting even though he was the stereotypical small-town idiot.  His performance elicited equal amounts of sympathy and fear.I would've rated the movie much higher if it wasn't for Annie's motivations toward the end.  She knows through her visions that Donnie didn't do it. She then states this revelation to the two most likely suspects!  She even lets the prosecutor know that she saw them at the country club.  Not only does she put herself in [more] needless peril, she continues to jeopardize the lives of her sons.  So much for her motherly instincts...  I understand her desire to see the right man put away, but there had to be a more inconspicuous way to accomplish this goal.Also, in the end, we're confident that the murderer will go to jail.  Did the screenwriters forget that the wrongly accused wife-beater would now go free?  He is not exactly a rational man, and he would certainly exact justice on Annie for helping send him away. Maybe I missed it, but we should've learned that he died in jail.  Otherwise, we know that the peaceful moment that wraps up the movie is fleeting and Annie can look forward to continuing terror.All in all, a well directed movie with a good cast and a suspect screenplay. It could've been worse, but it also could've been a lot better.",The Gift

208,fiveginst1,"great thriller, great cast",7,24 January 2001,"I had wanted to see this movie for quite some time now, probably since around september.  It was killing me.  Now that it was released nationwide, i finally got the chance to watch this incredible movie.  The direction by Sam Raimi is the best i've seen him do, and i'm glad he is being taken seriously now-a-days.  The acting is just as good.  Of course the talk of the town is Cate Blanchett, and she deserves much attention, because she is truly a blessing to the acting community, and doesn't go over the top and overshadow the rest of the cast and the direction.  Usually, whenever i saw Keanu Reeves in a movie, i had a hard time taking him seriously.  I always viewed him as Ted from ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"" (you know what i'm talking about)...but this time around, i didn't think that, i saw him as a very talented person, doing a great job as the abusive husband.  Giovanni Ribisi should be well noted for his role as a mechanic with many childhood problems tearing at his adult mind, he was incredible.  Everyone else did equally as well, like Katie Holmes and Greg Kinnear, complementing the story and acting in a way that it was like they were one with the character (i know that sounds corny).  The plot is not deathly original, but the ending threw me off guard, and the pace more than made up for it. With such appropriate acting and the taut direction and cinematography, i believe this to be one of the best movies i've seen in a while.  There is a scene so perfect i was in complete awe.  Cate's character comes out of her house, inspecting something, and she looks up and sees Katie floating below the branches of a tree, swimming in the air.  Great. Highly Recommended.",The Gift
209,Tim_UK,Surprisingly scary,8,5 March 2001,"A very tense film, with well developed deep characters.  Brilliant acting by Blanchett, totally believable in an unbelievable role!  Buddy is fascinating, Reeves character also too scary to be true.  Brilliantly dark and far more tense than ""Hannibal"" can dream to be.  Katie Holmes plays her part as the only girl worth having in town to a tee!  Fantastic Sunday afternoon movie",The Gift
210,vaughn-21,More predictable than scary,3,21 December 2001,"Some people try to figure out the endings of a movie like they will receive a prize for being right. I don't do this because I feel that the true prize is experiencing the movie unfolding before you. Consider this when I say that I figured out who the killer was a half hour before the end of the movie. This would only happen in my passive mind if it were totally obvious (e. g. 2+2=4). A friend of mine who saw this with me claims he figured it out 20 minutes into the film, this is highly possible.There is a lot of talent wasted in this boring and predictable ""thriller."" whoever did the sets should be commended, they are so convincingly sordid that you can almost feel the humidity of this poor southern town.

211,missygp,"Unbelievable cast, terribly bad...",4,21 March 2003,"I cannot believe anyone could give this picture 10 out of 10.  It was dire. How can so many extremely talented actors - Cate Blanchett, Greg Kinnear, Hillary Swank - be in something so terrible.  I normally have time for Giovanni Ribisi, but his character is ill-developed and not given enough time to show the progression into rage.  Katie Holmes was the one of the only good things - she played the role well, for the very short time she was in it.  And Keanu Reeves was ok too as the overbearing, oppressive and violent husband who becomes chief murder suspect.  But really, what a poor vehicle for so much talent.  Unpleasant, over the top, everyone seemed a caricature of themselves.  Not recommended!",The Gift

The atmosphere is authentic to the Louisiana swamps where he grew up. (Although I think the movie is supposed to take place elsewhere, the people and the locale seem to be genuine Bayou Cajun). And there are no extras in this movie, it is fun to see all the great stars in small character parts.",The Gift
213,zoradekugyorg,Great movie but ending was rushed,7,14 March 2021,"The movie has a stellar cast, awesome director, and lighting that makes the movie look like a 70/80s horror movie. It has a lot of great drama and acting.Without spoiling the movie, the movie kind of rushes to the end with simple visions and treatments. While there are some twists and unexpected story pieces, it just seems like everything fell in her lap at the end. The movie is rather short, I think an extra half hour could've been added to give the film extra mystery, focus more on the characters such as her personal life with kids or how she became a psychic, which is instead told through exposition.. I just left feeling like I wanted much more. The film works great as is, but I think it could've been made into a classic just by adding runtime and diving into all her personal life details, adding mystery and having a bit more mystery/detective like work at the end. Her visions were nice and creepy but I think the movie would've benefited from her following them like clues a bit more. The story became more like a thriller rather than a mystery which is fine, I just feel it was missing key pieces. Still a good watch for a one time viewing, it definitely pulled me in.",The Gift
214,H-9,"Great all around--cast, director, effects, sound, set",10,18 January 2001,"Stellar directing and acting make what could be tiresome and cliche-ridden instead riveting, moving, and at times frightening.  Highly recommend seeing this in the cinema, especially with a big screen and good sound--the visual and auditory experience is powerful.  All the leads turn in great performances, but especially noteworthy are Blanchett and Ribisi (a personal favorite who, I think, is generally underappreciated).  I also found Reeves very interesting in a strong and well-executed departure from his usual roles.",The Gift
215,minhee,"Not suspenseful, but atmospheric with great performances",8,13 June 2001,"I disagree with the comment that I read that said that the movie kept you guessing at who the murderer is.  I could see it from a mile away.  But it does a great job at presenting a picture of the south and the compelling characters that occupy it, from the tortured (Giovanni Ribisi) to the luminous (Cate Blanchett).  Now, of course, there's people like this all over the world, but there's a quality to these people that it seems like you would be hard-pressed to find elsewhere.Oh, and there's terrific performances to boot!  Cate Blanchett just gets better and better.  This performance confirms her reputation as an intelligent and gifted actress.",The Gift
216,sheepeyes,Great film from start to middle,8,22 March 2001,"Ok, that might be a bit harsh. The film was great from the start to about ten minutes from the end when it began to fall apart, mainly due to Raimi's efforts to fit a 'twist' in that ultimately didn't gel. But this is almost my only criticism.The thing that really made this film work was the casting, most notably Cate Blanchett. She looked luminous and really anchored the film and held it together. She portrayed her character with real sympathy, displaying the confusion and pain her gift has caused her, but never allowed her to fall apart or appear weak. She was a strong, credible yet fragile character.Keanu Reeves did a little less well and those looking for evidence that the man can act will have to wait longer I'm afraid. His character, Donnie Barksdale, is required to do little more than shout and look menacing which is all Keanu can do really. That'll be him perfectly suited to his character then.All together the cast, including Greg Kinnear and Katie Holmes, does great, with the one exception being Hilary Swank who is woefully underused as Donnie's long suffering wife. Special mention also has to go to Giovanni Ribisi who excelled as troubled mechanic Buddy Cole. It's about time he started getting more recognition in Hollywood and hopefully now's the time.Overall it's a film I recommend to anyone looking for a good spinetingler. Not too gory, so I was surprised by the 18 cert it got here in Ireland. It's not quite as jumpy as What Lies Beneath either, but it doesn't really set out to be. What it is is a good old fashioned chiller: eerie, slowburning, character driven and definitely worth the admission fee.",The Gift
217,Scott Stengrim,What is the Gift?,2,23 January 2001,"The gift is a slow moving, utterly useless film.  Don't get me wrong I love Sam Raimi's films, but this one he tries to hard to get what seems to be the big movie these days.  I film with curves that will lead to some big ending.  When looking at the title, you assume the gift is Cates special powers, but it might not be.  It's taking its time in showing the gift is friends, family, love, commitment.  To bad the movie is slow at showing these things.  The acting a awful, Keanu is the only one who seems to be enjoying himself in his role.  more than likely because he knows this film is crap.  I give this film a 2 only because Katie Holmes bares more than normal.",The Gift

I had heard that this film was great but didn't have the opportunity to see it in it's year 2000 release.  I had been nothing short of disappointed at what I had seen this year (2001) as far as summer movies go, so this film was a blessing in disguise.This film has everything you expect from it's genre and more!!!  It's hard to nail down at times, which means that it's not predictable as most movies. It's also the scariest, freakiest, and hair raising experiences I've ever had.  Cate Blanchett is excellent as is the supporting cast.  (3 1/2 out of 4 stars)",The Gift

222,notoriousii,Belongs on Lifetime Not TNT,6,17 June 2004,"Either Billy Bob Thornton's co-writing of this movie or the yearning for gender specific(women's) programming is what landed this film on TNT. I decided to rent the movie to get the full of it(I interrupted my girlfriend while we were watching it, and renting the film was the peace offering). I have to say the graphic depictions of women being abused does not gel with TNT's usual programming. Guys do not be fooled by the Thornton Name, this is a ""CHICK FLICK."" If you are expecting something profound like SLING BLADE you will definitely be disappointed. Keep your expectations low if you watch this movie. BTW the blue diamond inside jokes that you'll miss out on almost make it worth the watch(I know, insensitive, just how comedy is supposed to be). 6/10",The Gift
223,jeremy-340,So bad it's almost a comedy - but not quite,1,2 August 2005,"I actually looked up this movie on the IMDb to check if it was supposed to be a parody film (like Scary Movie) and I was the one guy who didn't know. So here I am now writing a review because I just can't believe the ratio between known quality talent (Cate Blanchett, Hilary Swank, Keanu Reeves, Giovanni Ribisi, Greg Kinnear, Katie Holmes - for goodness sake think of the movies that could have been made with this line-up!) and end product. You folks should start a new ""Blockbuster vs Bomb"" index of Resulting film divided by Known talent - this film would be darn close to the worst possible 1/10 score - a true Bomb.Nearly every cheap film-making cliché is used to manipulate the viewer - discordant violins at the ""crucial moment"", gross-out make-up and blood splodges, ""scary"" wind and lighting effects in the Bayou trees, sudden appearances on-camera, etc. Name 'em, they're in there. Then there are the paint-by-numbers characters that are used to fill in the blanks, such as various sheriffs, etc.It is true that Keanu Reeves is convincing as the wife-beating redneck - a good performance. Cate Blanchett was presumably under Director's orders to project all kinds of strong emotions, which she does. And like many actors before him, Giovanni Ribisi puts on a compelling show as the unpredictable mentally ill guy. When you roll in sweet girl Katie Holmes as the village slut and tidy Brit Cate playing the Bayou welfare single mom, it leads me to guess that the reason for making the movie was to give all these people an opportunity to play a contrasting role with their historical castings.I am seriously going to ask for my rental money back when I return it to the video store, something I have never done before. I have previously watched equally bad movies but never before have I seen such a waste of talent and, ultimately, money. This industry apparently has trouble making profits - are people still asking why?",The Gift
224,bleary,As an inept a piece of film-making as I've ever seen...,2,26 January 2002,"I can see very well why Cate Blanchett took the role - it gives her a vast array of emotions to work through. But it's disappointing to see her give such an interesting performance in such a poor film. In fact, I would even separate her performance from the dull character she is given to work with.The female characters in the film are all victims. The men are all basically evil - or stupid. Without exception.Not even the main character is allowed to be very strong. Most of her visions are misleading or basically wrong. She goes to help Giovanni Ribisi's character, only to watch him suffer even more. And the viewer along with him.What was Sam Raimi thinking? There is more style in his Evil Dead movies. Dare I say it, more passion and energy in them, too.Only two visuals in the whole film are worthy of him - the sped-up fiddler and the woman in the tree. Those two visuals prompt me to rate the film 2 out of 10.",The Gift
225,chernov,A stunning performance by Cate Blanchett.,10,13 January 2002,"This is a wonderfully crafted movie done with sensitivity, style and extraordinary suspense.  The casting is superb -- from large roles to small -- and Cate Blanchett continues to cement her place as my favorite actress. The production design and cinematography were very effective in evoking the feeling of the small town South.  One small cavil:  Keanu Reeves' character seemed to find a degree of dignity and character during his trial that would be unexpected from the vicious redneck portrayed earlier in the film.  All in all, rates a solid '10' from me.",The Gift
226,jedfindlay,Raimi's capabilities shine,7,22 January 2001,"Going to the theater these days often is an exercise in toleration.  Often films offer visual escapades that sideline characters and interesting storytelling.  The Gift seemed to function on that level.  I entered knowing several things, having already seen several films relating to the issues that the film deals with.  Frankly, the term spoiler cannot be applied to today's film realm, unless ""spoiling"" the enjoyment of the crisp presentation of an old twist or interesting visual trick.  The audience should be trained to understand that Cate Blanchet is going to suffer in the film, but will conquer in the finale.  That the mystery will be solved, and all of the eerieness will be completed.  There will be closure for characters as well as the audience.I never thought the film would step beyond this, and it doesn't.  But Raimi tells a hell of a yarn.  I found his use of editing to be most pleasing to the rhythmic flow of the film.  He somehow constructs a moving image within his dense frames.  Some moments are interesting, none all that frightening, or groudbreaking... yet the film stands firm and filled with confidence... ready to move you.This is a popcorn movie... made by an intelligent group.  It shall entice.",The Gift

How appropriate that Billy Bob Thornton had a hand in this one as well.Yes, there were hokey parts, as some of the preceding comments note. But for the most part, it appears many other reviewers were equally as enthralled as I. It was a little campy at times, reminding me of some of the classic ""B"" movies of the 60's, parts were horrifying, and then others simply humorously entertaining. Others wrote they KNEW who did it from the beginning, well, it was a race until the end for me. And, the fiddler scene sent a jolt down my spine that seldoms happens, absolutely horrifying.  (the last time I experienced a jolt equal to the fiddler scene would have been in the Devil's Advocate, when the wife is trying on clothes with her new friends and one of them has a facial tick while a dress slips over her head).Another comment earlier mentioned is there ANYTHING billy bob thornton can't do??

228,jhawk38-1,Overall Great Performances,9,30 January 2001,"As an avid movie fan for over 55 years, I would like to say I enjoyed this movie on many levels.  And, although it used many of the modern day cinematic sight and sound ""tricks"", as I call them, I first and foremost tried to focus on the performances.In that area, I found few, if any, faults.  Let me firstly say, that as an ""old timer"", I was raised on the notion of actresses (ooops, there I go again showing my age; I know the term today is ""actor"" for both sexes) being ""glamorous"".  I saw and immensely admired Cate's turn in Elizabeth in a starring role and even liked her in a minor part in The Talented Mr. Ripley. But, in The Gift, I think she has truly moved beyond a limited audience. This time I was impressed not only with her acting ability, but her beauty, as well.  I think I have finally come to fully understand that beauty truly does come from within.  Cate is luminescent!I think enough has already been said about Reeves' strong performance as a ""bad guy"", but I was really knocked out by two lesser roles played by J. K. Simmons (Call me Schillinger) as Sheriff Pearl (how'd ya like to have that name as a man in a small southern town?) Johnson or Michael Jeter as Donnie's attorney.  Both were terrific.So, to all you drama students out there, I guess what I am saying is if the plot is bad, try to focus on the performances.  If those are bad, try to appreciate the cinematography.  If that's bad, just enjoy the car chases and the bare breasts!",The Gift
229,mbc_agc,Disappointing in it's sheer stero-types.,6,9 January 2002,"Highly disappointing in this viewer's opinion. This film is stereotypical to the extremes, and I was disappointed that Billy Bob Thornton, and anyone who touched ""American Gothic"", would choose to not give greater depth to the topics of psychicism, small-town living, and better defense of this phenomenon as non-evil. The Southern accents of all major players are weak at best, and completely unconvincing at worst. Annie is absolutely moronic in most of her decisions, and we could have gotten to the same place with Donny without as much sheer ignorance on her character's part. And come on...the murdered girl---the character didn't even make enough impression for me to remember her name since yesterday---looks enough like Monica Lewinsky so that it completly shattered any sort of idea that the stereotypes were used to add to this film. I can not believe that I actually bought this movie based upon the name of Billy Bob Thornton. I have been a great admirer of Billy Bob, but wonder if Hollywood hasn't erased his true roots, and the ability to portray the South with any sort of clarity. Do better man! I've never been into hero worship, but really thought this intelligent, multi-talented entertainer would go the extra mile with everything that he touched. Maybe the next film will be spectacular and I can modify my opinion, but for now...I recommend that you check out the other movie I reviewed which deals with ""The Gift"" in a touching, thought provoking way.",The Gift

There's only one problem: this is totally taboo in this part of the country.Everyone's acting is superb, (with the exception of Greg Kinnear, who has the same expression on his face from beginning to end.) A very special shoutout goes to Giovanni Ribisi for his skillfully layered portrayal of the troubled Buddy Cole.A riveting storyline supported by an exquisite musical score are sure to keep the viewer engrossed from start to finish.The Gift is most definitely a film to cherish, and a true gift to us all.",The Gift

The screenplay a perfect machine in every detail, and although the plot is someway predictable, it manages to keep your interest alive 'til the end. Moreover, it succeeds in handling two very dangerous items: a slow pace and flash-forwards (the visions). It never exceeds on the horror side and gracefully avoids some easy tricks (a friend of mine was expecting the dead husband to appear anytime in the ending).

It was actually good to see a movie that was written so creatively. A movie with a plot that worked well, and the cinematography exceptionally divine. The Gift, still remains one of my favorite movies. The movie offered characters you liked or disliked, the end result is that you cared about their emotions, their lives. Most times when you view a movie, you have no clarity, no meaning. The plots are warped with meaningless jargon, and you could careless about the characters. The Gift gave you more than just a few memorable lines and cheesy actors. This movie allowed you to imagine, "" what if?"". What if these particular events happened to you...what would you do? How would it affect your life? I would definitely recommend this movie.",The Gift

To the actors' credit, the characters as portrayed are three-dimensional and believable, for the most part.  Unfortunately, several loose ends and unlikely occurrences hamstring the film.  Cate Blanchett's character, whom we are to believe is a strong and independent woman fiercely protective of her children, fails to contact the authorities after twice being assaulted by Keanu Reeves, once with a multitude of witnesses.  When she finally does call the police, she fails to bring up the attacks in support of her charges of breaking and entering.  In fact, during the entire trial of Barksdale the issue never arises. The plot ""twist"" is also unfortunately predictable.  I suppose this is a case of pandering to the lowest common denominator of filmgoers; how many movies are there based on the premise ""you thought he was the good guy--but he's really the bad guy!"" Finally, has it occurred to anyone that when Greg Kinnear goes off to the big house, Donnie will probably be released?  And that he probably isn't going to be too happy with Blanchett (now without her protector, Ribisi)? This is a loose end that really ought to have been tied up.",The Gift

I was intrigued by the part I saw on TV and although I tend to shy away from movies related to the supernatural--I was amazed at the awesome performances of Blanchett and Giovanni Ribisi...However, I was very disappointed when I saw the full movie...I was disappointed that an all star cast agreed to do a movie where I realized there was not a single person of color--African American or otherwise in any major or pivotal role in the movie...I was also appalled at the racist comments made by Keanu Reeves' character--Keanu had been a favorite of mine due to ""The Matrix"" series...But no longer...Being a native Alabamian and having lived among racists and suffered due to racism--I found the whole image of so-called ""red necks"" very distasteful and not worthy of the all star cast who could really pick and choose their roles...Perhaps I should be more broad minded--but it just seemed that the stereotypical images of southerners, rednecks, victims of domestic violence--could have been left off of this otherwise interesting movie...""What a shame that the writers felt the need to muddy the waters of what could have been a truly awesome movie with such unfortunate images""...The whole idea of people returning from the dead also took away from the overall effect of the movie--""Who really hit Greg Kinnear's character thereby saving the heroine?""",The Gift

Cate Blanchett, Giovanni Ribisi and Keanu Reeves create very convincing emotionally interesting characters. That might be a good reason to watch it.However after watching it I was very disappointed by the predictability as well as many plot holes of the movie (in my opinion). There were several good scenes which were never explained or expanded upon. There are some good tense moments which were once again left unexplained. This left a bitter aftertaste and this is the main reason for my opinion.I would characterize this movie as the drama/murder mystery with some mystical elements. Mystical elements are the basis of the plot and so cannot be completely removed. Yet, those elements are the least developed part of the movie.",The Gift

Cate Blanchett, as the widowed mother was convincing and heart-breaking in her struggles to maintain her family. Her interactions with her sons were beautiful. Hillary Swank, as the battered wife to Keanu Reeves was extremely believable. I did think Greg Kinnear was too nice as the principal (and I should know, I've been a teacher 32 years), but his pain seemed authentic. I found the entire ambiance of the film to be very true and evoked sympathetic feeling from me. I did love this movie, and enjoy it as I watch again and again.",The Gift

She is appropriately single-credited above the title. And she is that good.Big-name cast - the supporting players all work well, including a surprisingly fine performance by Keanu Reeves as Donnie, the heavy. Giovanni Ribisi as Annie's friend is fascinating and believable in his tormented portrayal.  Sweet little Katie Holmes moves well beyond her high school years of Dawson's Creek as she takes on a shockingly adult role as the town mattress.Tons of atmosphere - via the superb script, the excellent locations, the well-handled effects, and the pervasive (but subtle) use of music and sound effects: all mixed and served with Raimi's deft touch. This is a modern rendering of classic thriller genre. Think Hitchcock in color and THX.The characters are developed well and the viewer gets to know them as the story unfolds and there occurs the inevitable creepy murder.You will be on the edge of your seat as the plot twists on itself on the way to a non-preachy ending.I don't want to reveal too much of the story, since it is so integral to the enjoyment of the whole.Small treat: look for Danny Elfmann (the musician/songwriter) playing eerie fiddle in an even eerier setting.Get ready to be scared and entertained. Choose a theater with a high-end sound system. Buy a large popcorn to avoid missing even the smallest scene. Enjoy.",The Gift
242,zardoz-4,Potentially great film ruined by director ignorance.,6,14 August 2001,"This should have been a perfect movie---great acting, good direction, beautiful photography, good story.  But what ruined it for me was the fact that NO PSYCHIC ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD WOULD EVER USE THE CARDS THIS CHARACTER WAS GIVEN TO USE FOR HER ""PSYCHIC WORK.""  The cards our heroine used were the Rhine cards used at Duke University for measuring ""chance"" in attempts to prove psychic phenomena existed in the middle of the last century.  Such ignorance from the director on down is just appalling. Doesn't anyone do their homework anymore?  Why was no metaphysical consultant hired for such a film instead of allowing ignorance and stupidity to reign supreme?  Sad to ruin such a potentially good film.",The Gift
243,AledDavies,A film worth seeing,9,31 December 2000,"'The Gift' by Sam Raimi and Billy Bob Thornton which is a good old fashioned thriller, the kind most of Hollywood has forgotten how to make.

Anyway, it's an entertaining and well done movie.",The Gift
246,surfshirtslacker,Sam Raimi? Billy Bob Thornton? That Cast! How can it be bad?,9,29 November 2000,"Honored to have seen an advanced screening of this movie having lived in Los Angeles this past summer while I attended the New York Film Academy in Universal Studios, LA; I am now a changed man. With an upbeat, elaborate plot loosely similar to 1999's Stir of Echoes, together director Raimi (A Simple Plan) and writer Billy Bob Thornton (star, director and writer of 1996's wonderful Sling Blade)really know how to make an audience jump out of their seats! Although it was Oscar nominee Cate Blanchett (of 1997's Elizabeth)that was donned the title role, the true star (who hopefully won't be denied of an Oscar nomination for best Supporting Actor) is Giovanni Ribisi. Even more so than Keanu Reeves who plays a character he never played before, Ribisi dominates in making the audience jump, laugh, cry, and simply say ""Wow! Is that really the guy who starred in that rancid Gary Marshall movie The Other Sister?"" Yes, that is how good he is. Hillary Swank (Woah do I envy her abilities after one of my personal favorites 1999's Boys Don't Cry... She's the kind of girl I wish would e-mail me and meet me somewhere for lunch, dinner for that matter!) plays Keanu's abused wife who looks to Blanchett for spiritual advice. (Yes, the title of the movie comes from Blanchett's gift being a professional tarot card reader, VERY professional!)As always, including her adorable performance in The Next Karate Kid, Swank is brilliant, she has the nicest eyes, but her performance is amazing even past her eyes! Then Greg Kinnear and Katie Holmes (God bless her for NOT having a no-nudity contract)surprisingly play an engaged couple in the film. At first you'll think the casting is crazy but eventually you'll realize it was undeniably brilliant casting. Kinnear's character is not just thrown in, he is the school principal of Blanchett's two young boys, and he progresses into the widow of Katie Holmes, whose murder is the mystery of the film, the sight Blanchett must discover spiritually. I WILL NOT ruin the surprise ending for you under all circumstances for I strongly encourage you see this movie. It is almost impossible not to look this movie. The acting is great by everyone, the direction is eerily clever (but what do we expect from Raimi now that he learned his lesson from For Love of the Game), and the always brilliant work (writing in this case) of Billy Bob Thornton is great! It will scare you so be prepared, and also be prepared to have a good time! ENJOY!",The Gift
247,brewmasterflex,Great characters and a great cast.,10,21 January 2001,"This movie was very well made and extremely well acted. The southern backdrop adds to the creepy and oddly funny white trash roots of the film. Every actor plays the hell out of their character and all involved especially Holmes, Kinnear, Reeves and Swank should be given some credit for taking very off track roles. Blanchet is great and if the gift werent so rooted in the supernatural i would hazard to say she might have herself an oscar nod.

How original.And then the violins start playing... be sure to have a vomit bag ready for the end of the movie as it truly is a sickening display of hugging and loving. Oh dear, did I just *spoil* something? No, because this movie is just another formula movie with some ""Sixth Sense"" stuff put into it to make it able to pay Raimi's rent.On the good side, Giovanni Ribisi puts up a good performance and the sheriff made me laugh a couple of times, but the rest is utterly forgettable.

The performances were excellent (even from the usually lackluster Keanu Reeves), the Gothic atmosphere was strong, and the dialogue was believable and interesting.  All of a sudden, during the unrealistic trial scene, ""The Gift"" became a formulaic mess of a film.  It went from a tense, psychological thriller to a cliché-ridden horror flick, complete with astoundingly predictable twist ending. This film could have been a great thriller, but by the end, it settles into middle-of-the-road blandness.",The Gift

256,fbnb,Keep the receipt,5,25 February 2002,"Populated with barely fleshed out stereotypes, and a plot that has a deja vu quality, The Gift quickly became an exercise in viewer endurance.  I don't demand perfect logic in a movie, but some gaps gave the script a stitched together feel.  For example; if you're the district attorney, do you first interview the key witness the afternoon before the trial begins?  Only in this rush to judgment ... or should I say, rush to the ""surprise"" ending. The script packs more than it's share of red herrings in an attempt to barely conceal the mystery.  In fact, there's even a summation of herrings in a truly desperate move at maintaining suspense.  Kate Blanchett does a commendable job in a role that would have been Sissy Spacek's a few years ago.  Beyond that, this is one ""Gift"" you'll probably want to return.",The Gift

What's the point of it all?!?,2,1 November 2008,"My grandmother and uncle went on and on about how wonderful this movie was, they absolutely adored it, so my mother and I decided to borrow it and sit down one gloomy Saturday to watch it. Big mistake.Keanu Reeves at first is unrecognizable, but pulls off a nice angry redneck in the end. A look into his personal life? Reeves, you should have let your acting career end when your teenage years did.I've only ever seen Cate in LOTR, so this was an interesting role for me to see her in. Her acting is good...for the most part. She does an excellent doe-eyed frightened little-girl look when called for, but overall I find her physical appearance bland.The whole movie leaves you with an ""okay...?"" feeling at the end. What was the point of it all? Could someone please enlighten me? I didn't feel anything towards the broody teacher, therefore I wasn't entirely surprised when he turns out as the killer in the end. what I want to know is why they decided to stuff him in the trunk after he was rendered unconscious. (then proceed to sit at the scene of the crime for what appears to be at least an hour, long enough for Cate's bad makeup blood to dry a nice ketchup-y color) before going to the police.Don't even get me started on the crazy-guy ghost savior.

Great entertainment.Cate Blanchett stars as Annie Wilson, a young widow with three sons to raise -- her husband was killed a year before the story in a work-related accident. She and the boys survive on a social security check each month -- to further make ends meet, she gives 'readings' to various members of the small Georgia community of Brixton, calling her talent a 'gift'. She accepts donations, but doesn't set prices -- she doesn't come across as a sideshow fortune teller here. She doesn't have the power to read minds -- or, in a courtroom scene, to tell an attorney how many fingers he's holding up behind his back -- and she never makes any claims in that area. Her gift comes to her in the form of visions or dreams -- sometimes they occur when she's giving a reading, sometimes they come unexpectedly.",The Gift

First of all i thought, the story wasn't developed very well with the murder mystery. The mystery was no more in the middle of the movie as it was easy to predict who might the murderer. I also thought Keanu Reeves might have been wasted in this movie. I would suggest this movie for people who should not expect a great mystery movie.

You'll see the ending before it comes and wish there was a better storyline, the dialogue is weak and the plot makes a Nancy Drew novel look like a classic of fine literature. The characters are so shallow they're transparent. The directing had a one-take look, and the production values are made-for-t.v., movie of the week.This film was written by Billy Bob Thornton, but it's surely no ""Sling Blade"". . The movie was made on the cheap, for a mere ten million, and box office draws more than quadrupled that making the film a commercial success. How? I'll never know.",The Gift
262,standardcandlebass,Brilliant performances,7,28 January 2005,"There is some great acting in this one. Obviously, Blanchett does a wonderful job as always. The performance that struck me the most though was Giovanni Ribisi's portrayal of ""Buddy"". Some actors would have just acted like a crazy lunatic, but Ribisi comes across on several levels and manages to make Buddy, in my opinion, the most interesting character in the movie. Hillary Swank also turns in a great performance as ""Valerie"", the white trash neighbor who takes more than a few love taps from her husband. I live in Alabama, so I can say from experience that she nailed the part. Kuddo's to Reeve's who managed to get through a whole movie without saying ""Whoa"". The story line is nothing new, but the director does a good job of telling the story and giving the movie a haunting feel. On a personal note, and as a fan of ""Dawson's Creek"", its was nice to finally see Katie Holmes with her shirt off. Good stuff.",The Gift

Kept me engrossed from start to finish and that is saying a lot as not many movies hold my complete attention for that long. The acting of the whole ensemble was adequate but primaries especially did well with their roles. Keanu Reeves was very convincing as a backwoods wife beater and Hillary Swank played her part as the long suffering wife to a tee. Cate Blanchette was excellent as Annie Wilson, gave just the right touches to be realistic as I do know of several ""seers"" in real life and she captured their essence completely in my opinion.",The Gift

Until I saw her in this movie, she was awesome, too. They were all awesome. This movie was nothing less than pure 100% genius. I had no idea Billy Bob Thorton was part writer on this which also explains why it is so damn good. Everyone in this movie showed their acting abilities. Even the kids were great, even the dog was great. This is how much I enjoyed this movie. If you like a murder mystery than check this flick out. You won't be sorry!!",The Gift
266,discokeet,Underrated Raimi Thriller,9,16 August 2005,"'The Gift', a taut psychological thriller, is one of Sam 'Spider-Man' Raimi's more modest works. The emphasis is on story and characters rather than flashy special effects and cheap tricks. An A-List cast lead by Cate Blanchette delivers solid performances, even if it is difficult to buy Keanu Reeves with a Southern accent.It's an interesting attempt to combine the dramatic elements of 'A Simple Plan' with the supernatural, horror elements of Raimi's earlier works, the ones that made him famous: 'Evil Dead' and 'Evil Dead II'.There are plenty of twists, enough to keep you guessing, and this is not a predictable movie despite what the naysayers may try to make you believe (the ones that sit the whole movie trying to guess the end, and when one of their twenty guesses prove right, they scream, ""I TOLD you!""). It's the sort of movie where if you keep attempting to out-think the movie at so many twists and turns, that it's impossible that at least one of your guesses won't be correct.It's not ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""Memento"" where the ending will make you rethink the entire way you view the film, but it's definitely worth more than one viewing. It's entertaining, atmospheric, and suspenseful.Funniliy enough, 'The Gift' is most famous for Katie Holmes' breasts, but that's certainly not the reason to see this movie.",The Gift

Cate Blanchett did a terrific job as the lead character and she worked with an incredible crew: Keanu Reeves, Katie Holmes, Michael Jeter, Greg Kinnear...gosh, every actor in this film is distinguished in his or her own right and did excellent work.

There is a pervasive feeling of imminent danger...you fear for the main character, not only because of what 'the bad guy' might do to her, but because of what the other ordinary people around her might do to her, for displaying the abilities she displays.This is a movie well worth seeing if you have an interest in psi abilities, or happen to have a touch of them yourself.",The Gift
