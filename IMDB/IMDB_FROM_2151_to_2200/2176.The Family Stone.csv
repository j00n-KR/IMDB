0,SnoopyStyle,good family chemistry and dysfunction,7,26 December 2014,Meredith Morton (Sarah Jessica Parker) is really uptight. She accompanies her boyfriend Everett Stone (Dermot Mulroney) to his family's Christmas holidays. The Stone family is headed by Sybil (Diane Keaton) and Kelly (Craig T. Nelson). Susannah (Elizabeth Reaser) is the oldest sibling and a stay-at-home mom. Ben (Luke Wilson) is a stoner. Amy (Rachel McAdams) hates Meredith. Thad (Tyrone Giordano) is gay and deaf. Meredith feels picked on especially by Amy and leaves to stay at the inn. She asks her more relaxed sister Julie (Claire Danes) to join her. Everett wants to propose to Meredith with grandma's ring but Sybil refuses to give him the ring. Everybody objects to the proposal.It's a quirky family Christmas holiday get together. It's not anything new but it's always good material to mine. SJP is overplaying her character a little. She doesn't need to play the role as if she's got a board in her back. McAdams is a fun meanie and she allows for some comedy to come through with SJP. The cast for the family is great and they have good chemistry together.,The Family Stone
1,claudio_carvalho,A Nest of Snakes,6,26 August 2006,"The prodigal son Everett Stone (Dermot Mulroney) brings his conservative and bigot fiancée Meredith Morton (Sarah Jessica Parker) to spend Christmas holidays with his very closed family. Meredith is coldly and hostilely welcomed by the family Stone, and feeling completely uncomfortable, she decides to call her sister Julie (Claire Danes) to stay with her. Along Christmas, revelations and new feelings are disclosed.""The Family Stone"" is not a bad movie but could be better and better. The story is very real, showing many credible characters and developing them perfectly, considering that this movie has a running time of only 103 minutes. However, the screenplay is quite confused and without a clear definition of its genre, oscillating between a heavy drama and a romantic comedy. The cinematography is very beautiful and the performances are excellent, with the exception of Dermot Mulroney, who is totally miscast, looking like a gangster and never like the romantic pair of Sarah Jessica Parker or Claire Danes. Another negative point is this politically correct and fashionable gay thing that Hollywood is exporting in their movies. With the intention of being commercial, now we have gays with son celebrating Christmas with members of a prejudicial family that do not accept the fiancée of their son, but for whom is absolutely perfect their Caucasian gay son have a black mate and a black adopted son later in a total lack of coherence. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Tudo em Família"" (""Everything in Family"")",The Family Stone
2,moonspinner55,"""You're a real mess--I mean that in the best possible way...""",3,1 June 2008,"You can be certain that writer-director Thomas Bezucha meant this comedy-drama to be a holiday perennial--it is crassly undermined by feel-good family sentiment once the mean-spirited jabs and insults have finally run themselves into the ground. Dermot Mulroney brings home prim girlfriend, urbanite Sarah Jessica Parker, to meet his large family for the first time during a woodsy Christmas weekend, apparently not explaining to her that his parents and assorted siblings are a selfish, judgmental bunch. Not that this starched sweetheart is a peach: she tries too hard, she fails to engage in normal-sounding chit-chat, and she shouts at the deaf brother (surprisingly, Bezucha doesn't score points against Parker's character for this, as he seems to do with every other faux pas she makes). Mulroney's sister (the snarling Rachel McAdams) immediately feels put out because Parker takes her bedroom--and she hates the way this intruder clears her throat. These are the types of petty gripes which permeate ""The Family Stone"", and they are no more funny nor 'realistic' by the finale, when Bezucha brings in those all-important Christmas tears and cheers. It must have been the basis of his pitch when he sold this thing to Fox. *1/2 from ****",The Family Stone
3,blanche-2,How to make a bad situation worse,7,27 December 2011,"Diane Keaton, Craig T. Nelson, Sarah Jessica Parker, Dermot Mulroney, and Luke Wilson star in ""The Family Stone,"" a 2005 holiday movie. Parker plays Meredith, the uptight girlfriend of Everett Stone (Mulroney) who accompanies him home for Christmas. She doesn't fit in with his family which consists of his tell-it-like-it-is mother (Keaton), his deaf gay brother Thad and his lover (Ty Giordano and Brian White), his brat sister who already doesn't like Meredith (Rachel McAdams), his fun brother (Wilson), his pregnant sister (Elizabeth Reaser) and her young daughter waiting for her husband to arrive, and his quiet, accepting father (Nelson).Meredith gets off on the wrong foot when she feels uncomfortable sharing a room with Everett and displaces Amy from her room. It goes from there, including a game of charades in which Meredith attempts to act out ""The Bride Wore Black"" and is accused by Amy of pointing to Thad's black lover. In desperation, Meredith moves to a local inn and calls her sister (Clare Danes) to join her for moral support.This is a sentimental, sometimes funny, predictable film with some good performances. It's a little overdone with the stereotypes -- it could have been effective without hitting us over the head. Diane Keaton is wonderful as a free-spirited mother who worries about Everett's choice of girlfriend and fearful that he's going to marry her. Craig T. Nelson is sympathetic as her husband, trying to keep it all together. Owen Wilson gives a funny performance as the laid-back brother, and Sarah Jessica Parker is appropriately an uptight wreck as Meredith. Dermot Mulroney vacillates between being tense and angry throughout as he deals with his family and Meredith. As the confused, pretty sister, Clare Danes doesn't have much to do but what she does is very good.Get ready to shed a few tears if you get into this film, which you might not. It's not for everyone, just us saps.Nevertheless, it's a lovely holiday film that emphasizes the importance of family, of finding out who you are, and of taking a risk.",The Family Stone
4,ComedyFan2010,A great family holiday movie with a lot of depth and humor,8,17 September 2014,"Everett brings his girlfriend Meredith for Christmas to his family, he also wants to propose to her. Yet his family really doesn't like her as she is very uptight.There are many family reunion for Holidays movies as well as meeting the family movies. But this one has some great elements about it which made me like it so much.The thing is that it shows the real ugly side of people. That even people who try to be open minded show prejudice towards the ones who are not like them. There was a study made on a dating website OkCupid. There is a bunch of questions that people answer to find a better match. One of them was ""Would you consider dating somebody who showed bias towards a race of people?"" Over 80% answered no and said it would be mandatory. And yet at the same time the rating of members made in a more impulsive way showed that black members of the site are on the losing end. The movie has nothing to do with race, but this study is a good example on how people often perform the same negative behavior that they are against. To emphasize it more Everett's family is very liberal and progressive. They have nothing against gays, races, disabilities, and yet they make the same mistake towards Meredith by right away classifying her as uptight and responding in a biased way to all her actions. They put her into a category and treat her as such without giving her a chance to find out who she is. I really liked how greatly this part of the movie was done.One thing that makes this movie a bit unbelievable is how at the end Meredith and Everett separate and end up with each other's siblings without much fuss or drama. Sure this would never happen in real life. But in this movie I rather looked at it in a metaphorical way with some Christmas magic in it. It is simply also about people who don't completely figured out who they are and try to go about their life the way they think they should be. But towards the end after going through some self discovery they end up on a right path (as in this case with a partner who is pretty much the opposite of their original).The movie has a great cast and we see some top acting. The characters show some very believable family dynamics. And we see them all as people who love each other, are not always saying and doing the right thing but at the same time learn and change during the time.",The Family Stone
5,michaelRokeefe,Quality family time...get real!,3,20 May 2006,This movie is billed as a dramatic comedy and it is just too quirky and at times so somber it is hard to really work up even a chuckle. Meredith Morton(Sarah Jessica Parker)is a tightly wound corporate executive invited by her boyfriend Everett Stone(Dermot Mulroney)to meet his family over the Christmas holiday. The Stone family headed by Sybil(Diane Keaton)and Kelly(Craig T. Nelson)is a very close-knit clan that has all intentions of getting rid of Ms. Stuck-Up and save the family's favorite son. Meredith calls on her sister Julie(Claire Danes)to come to the Stone home to fortify her efforts. Add this fox to the mix and complications set in.The cast also features Luke Wilson as one of Everett's brothers. Rachel McAdams is cast as the most abrasive of the clan; but still very impressive. Mulroney has no enthusiasm at all. Parker could be mistaken for a cadaver. Ms. Danes is the brightest and most interesting of the whole cast. You might get the idea that I am really disappointed in THE FAMILY STONE...that assumption is correct.,The Family Stone
6,jotix100,No Stone unturned,6,18 December 2005,"Beware of those seemingly happy families in the movies! Not all is what appears to be on the surface, judging by the new film ""The Family Stone"" directed by Thomas Bezucha, based on his own screen play. At times these Stones are just plain mean, but taking into consideration of who their unwelcome guest is, the oldest son's executive girlfriend, Meredith, it's no surprise the Stones rally against this intruder.The Stones' home is something only found in the movies. The ideal place where cinematic families live, is nothing like we mere mortals, could afford, or ever attain. The house is located in a picture perfect location. It's the ideal setting where a family like the Stones would live.The parents, Kelly and Sybil, are on the surface, at least, an ideal couple. Sybil is a woman whose mood swings as different personalities seem to come to possess her. This Sybil is in many ways not your typical mother of the movies. Her five children show various degrees of moderate dysfunction. We realize what Sybil is going through when she first appears staring blankly out of a window.The film makers were lucky in attracting Diane Keaton to the project. She is perfect as the mother of this family. Sarah Jessica Parker's Meredith also goes one on one with Ms. Keaton in an excellent take of her character. The rest of the cast, Craig T. Nelson, Claire Danes, Rachel McAdams, Dermot Mulroney, Luke Wilson, Elizabeth Reaser, make valuable contributions to the film.",The Family Stone
7,george.schmidt,"A ""Family"" Affair; subtly, slyly funny & wonderful comedy",9,19 December 2005,"THE FAMILY STONE (2005) ***1/2 Sarah Jessica Parker, Diane Keaton, Dermot Mulroney, Craig T. Nelson, Rachel McAdams, Luke Wilson, Claire Danes, Tyrone Giordano, Brian J. White, Elizabeth Reaser, Paul Schneider, Savannah Stehlin. Effortlessly charming and borderline cartoony screwball farce about an uptight woman (Parker doing one incredibly deft tightrope walk of sanity) meeting her boyfriend's very discriminating yet overly loving family for the Christmas holiday that offers some sublime acting, subtle variations of theme (i.e. family is dysfunctional yet essential) and belly-laughs out of nowhere in the broad physical slapstick and cuttingly sly dialogue intermingled thought thanks to relative newbie filmmaker Thomas Bezucha and an expert ensemble including rising star McAdams as a bitchy sibling and Wilson as the stoner black-sheep whose laid back manner is a thing of slacker beauty (and then some). Surprisingly better than anticipated and thankfully so. Funny, smart and wonderful.",The Family Stone
8,evanston_dad,A Big Fat Holiday Turkey,3,27 November 2006,"If you've got a hankering for a good old fashioned feel-bad holiday movie, ""The Family Stone"" will be right up your alley. Then you may be able to enjoy this grueling story about an uptight and mostly unlikable yuppie, Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker), being introduced to her fiancé's mostly obnoxious and unfriendly family, led by dragon-lady mom (Diane Keaton) and wet noodle dad (Craig T. Nelson, playing a complete lump of a character). I guess we're supposed to find the Stones charming, because they're liberal and are nice to their saintly gay (and deaf!) son (who's adopting a child with his black boyfriend, no less), but I just found them intolerable. Things get oh so wacky when Meredith's sister, Claire Danes, shows up to lend support and falls for Meredith's fiancé, while Meredith herself falls for the stoned slacker son (Luke Wilson) who we're supposed to believe, in a stretch of imagination that no amount of yoga will make possible, is a documentary film maker. Oh, and did I mention the cranky youngest daughter, played by Rachel McAdams, who you just might want to see stuffed and roasted along with the turkey? This is perhaps one of the worst scripts ever put to the screen. Not one moment in this film feels genuine or even logically sound. The screenwriters drag Claire Danes into the film and then have absolutely nothing for her character to do; her ""love story"" with Dermot Mulroney (he of the perpetual snarl) is not the least bit developed or believable. The middle of the film nearly grinds to a halt, then lurches queasily into a mad-cap screwball comedy mode that finds the women dropping food all over themselves in the kitchen while the brothers chase each other around the house with the intention of beating each other up. And to top everything off, there's a tacky and maudlin ending that's as cheap as it is cliché.Bah humbug to this poisonous dose of holiday cheer.Grade: D",The Family Stone
9,ferguson-6,Freak Flag,5,18 December 2005,"Greetings again from the darkness. How strange that this movie ALMOST made me feel sorry for Sarah Jessica Parker's cold fish character. The moment passed quickly, but did exist. Writer/Director Thomas Bezucha, who was responsible for the much more effective ""Big Eden"", takes on the giant task of exploring the complex infrastructure of a large liberal family headed by Diane Keaton and Craig T. Nelson.Rachel McAdams has the most fun as the ""mean"" youngest daughter, but mostly this family is, for no apparent reason, snotty and excluding of others until the outsiders prove they are worthy of attention from this troupe of misfits. Luke Wilson provides a nice touch as the oldest kid who apparently has no real life of his own, other than eye- balling women. I assume Bezucha thought all viewers would love the Stone family because .... HEAVEN FORBID ... they have accepted their gay son's black lover into their family. What a crock! Not going to waste my time writing much more on this film. I will say, however, that Dermot Mulroney's role is pretty much a full 180 from his hilarious turn in ""About Schmidt"". And, the ever-glorious Claire Danes once again illuminates the screen with her presence. For an infinitely better dysfunctional family comedy, see ""The Royal Tennenbaums""",The Family Stone
10,anaconda-40658,Family Stoned.,4,10 February 2016,"The Family Stone (2005): Dir: Thomas G. Bezucha / Cast: Sarah Jessica Parker, Dermot Mulroney, Diane Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Luke Wilson: Pitiful rehash of Meet the Parents regards how individuality holds a family strong although that doesn't help the film any. Dermot Mulroney is bringing his uptight girlfriend home for Christmas but nobody likes her because she's a bitch. Formula sitcom setting with director Thomas G. Bezucha doing his best to make this as realistic as possible. Sarah Jessica Parker is laughably being applauded for this lousy performance where we don't even like her even when we're suppose to like her. Parker can be a wonderful screen presence but there are moments here that are nearly painful to watch due to actions put forth. Mulroney is no help either because he plays a tight-ass with no personality. Diane Keaton is memorable as the mother with an illness that she wants to conceal until after the holidays. Rachel McAdams steals her scenes as Mulroney's sister who tries to make Parker's stay as miserable as possible. Luke Wilson plays a stoner in the family but chances are he is just reacting to the bad script. Theme regards acceptance and family bonding but the only bonding I witnessed is the togetherness of an audience that hurried to exit the theatre and mourn the loss of the ten bucks that they spent to see this crap. Score: 4 / 10",The Family Stone
11,gradyharp,'Have yourself a merry little Christmas'...with the Stone family!,8,3 May 2006,"Thomas Bezucha ('Big Eden') is a writer/director willing to address social issues in a setting where the issues become secondary to his characters. Though he is not polished as yet (Big Eden was a fine little film but hardly the credentials to be put in front of a cast a famous actors!), his heart is in the right place and he does have a penchant for finding comedy in the strangest places and allowing the viewer to embrace any of many issues about which he is talking.THE FAMILY STONE is a double play on words: Stone happens to be the name of a very weird and maladapted family finding conflicts blooming at Christmas, but the 'stone' also refers to the wedding ring of the mother's mother which is to be passed to the favorite son upon his engagement. Sybil (Diane Keaton) and Kelly (Craig T. Nelson) are the 'new generation' parents of a family of assorted siblings: pothead Ben (Luke Wilson), angry single Amy (Rachel McAdams), hearing impaired and gay Thad (Tyrone Giordano) partnered with African American Patrick (Brian White), married and pregnant Susannah (Elizabeth Reaser), and the poster boy eldest son Everett (Dermot Mulroney). The nidus of the story is Everett bringing uptight/bright/beautiful/critical Meredith Morton (Sarah Jessica Parker) home for the holiday to announce their engagement. No one likes opinionated Meredith and her uncomfortable 'welcome' triggers maladaptive behavior from everyone. Feeling isolated Meredith invites her sister Julie (Claire Danes) to join her as comfort, an act which opens the family to Julie's warmth and drives Meredith to a night of drinking and letting her hair down with the very mellow Ben. How these incidents intertwine and result in changes in all of the family members is the crux of the story.Along the rocky way Bezucha addresses gay partner infant adoption, fear of relationships, the impact of impending death, following the heart in love instead of the expected route of a family expectations, etc. There are just a few too many subplots to make the film digest well and employing a bit of Keystone Cops slapstick in the kitchen on Christmas morning sort of pushes the overstuffed bird over the edge. Yet with a cast like this the characters, unlikely though they may be, are brought into reality: Parker, Danes, Keaton, Wilson, Nelson, McAdams etc keep things flying. If the final curtain (the Christmas a year later showing the results of all the changes) is a bit too sappy, blame it on the season. This is not a great movie but a movie with heart from a writer/director who is unafraid to call attention to our human foibles. Grady Harp",The Family Stone
12,zetes,"Good for the most part, but it all works out too well in the end",7,24 July 2006,"Pretty good Christmastime family drama. A liberal family welcomes their son's conservative girlfriend into their home, but nothing goes right for any of them. Advertized as a comedy, the film is almost pure drama. In fact, the bulk of the comedy  all of which was featured in the previews  doesn't work that well (most notably the big slapstick sequence where Sarah Jessica Parker, Diane Keaton and Rachel McAdams all slip in some food). As drama, it is somewhat affecting. However, I hate that every little thing ends up working so perfectly by the end. I much prefer The Myth of Fingerprints, which ends in heartbreak and a family rift that might never be solved. That might have been a lot more truthful here. At least one of the plot lines could have been resolved less cleanly.",The Family Stone
13,siderite,Lots of embarrassing scenes in a make-believe family,6,1 January 2006,"Well, I can't judge this movie as a bad movie. It has plot complexities, nice seasoned actors that play their parts very well, cute Rachel McAddams and Claire Daines :), so it's definitely not bad. The word that comes to mind is ""phoney"", though.It all revolves around a family that is as believable as a sociodemographic statistic. It would have been a lot more real if it weren't for the gay deaf guy that had a black boyfriend and everyone was so OK with it.One of the children of the family comes with an awkward girl, trying to please everyone type, played by Sarah Jessica Parker. I really think that someone wanted to pay her back for Sex in the City or something. The woman is humiliated beyond belief or comic relief.When I think back at the movie, I really can't find a reason not to watch it, but I can't think of a reason to watch it either. It's a perfect time filler. It is not good, it is not bad, it is slightly offensive, slightly funny, actors are known, but you don't really care for them much unless you have a crush for Rachel like I do :).",The Family Stone
14,Buddy-51,a lump of Christmas coal,4,7 December 2006,"Despite the presence of actors no less stellar than Diane Keaton, Craig T. Nelson, Rachel McAdams, Clair Danes, Dermot Mulroney, Sarah Jessica Parker and Luke Wilson, I never believed for a moment that the characters in ""The Family Stone"" were ever related to one another in any way whatsoever. Both they and the story they are involved in feel like the products of a Screen writing 101 workshop, with all the realism and believability one would expect from such an enterprise.Keaton and Nelson are Sybil and Everett Stone, the parents of five grown children who have come together to celebrate one final Christmas together in the parents' idyllic Connecticut home before Sybil passes away from cancer. Each of the siblings has an ""idiosyncrasy"" stamped onto his or her persona with all the subtlety of a cattle brand. Everett (Mulroney), the stuffed-shirt perfectionist, has brought a woman home with him to meet the family - a rigid, equally uptight woman from The City named Meredith (Parker). The family takes an immediate disliking to her and wastes no time in trying to sabotage her chances with their darling son/brother - though why they don't see that Everett and Meredith are actually perfectly suited for one another is just one of the many head-scratching implausibilities that make up this script. Most of the film is spent with Meredith trying desperately to ingratiate herself with the nasty brood while the family worries about the impending loss of their wife and mother, and several of the children participate in a roundelay of romantic musical chairs more appropriate to a bunch of prepubescent adolescents than supposed adults in their twenties and thirties.As a family, the Stones are not so much dysfunctional as they are simply annoying. Insufferably smug, petty and self-righteous, the Stones are models of tolerance only when it comes to their own in-group apparently - being highly supportive of their deaf gay son/brother and his black partner, for instance - but they are far less inclined to extend that same courtesy to those unfortunate enough to be trapped outside the family circle. Frankly, after their nauseating mistreatment of Meredith, I couldn't figure out why she didn't just tell them all to go to hell, hightail it on out of there, and go spend Christmas with people who might actually like her and treat her like a genuine human being.To add insult to injury, the movie exploits the issue of terminal illness in an effort to lend unearned weight to what is otherwise a hopelessly contrived, unflaggingly trivial and utterly unconvincing family drama. The script hits its low point in a ridiculous, badly staged slapstick scene involving various family members sliding and skating across the slippery tiles after the family's holiday meal somehow lands on the kitchen floor (don't even ask). Not even a flavorful, touching coda can wipe away the bitter taste of much of what occurs earlier on in the film.For a much better variation on this theme of an outsider trying to batter her way into an exclusive family circle, check out the far superior ""Junebug"" and skip this lump of Christmas coal altogether.",The Family Stone
15,Robert_duder,The perfect modern day Holiday classic!,9,3 January 2006,"The Family Stone is an absolute holiday classic but not in the traditional sense. It's definitely a modern day holiday treat. The film centers around the Stone family...a rather rambunctious, large family who comes together for Christmas. Each one of them with their own distinct personality, personal problems, and home lives. On the forefront of this particular Christmas is son Everett's new girlfriend Merideth who is joining them for the first time. Merideth is the complete opposite of the Stone family. She's uptight, organized, very different in every way and she immediately clashes with their brash personalities as she desperately tries to fit in.Without a doubt a laugh out loud comedy it also has a real sincere touch of drama and sincere heart. The Stone family brings you in and makes you root for them, laugh with them, and share their pains also. Dermot Mulroney plays Everett. His personality is a little dry (as Mulroney's characters always tend to be) compared to the rest of the family. His performance lacks compared to everyone else. Sarah Jessica Parker is really the scene stealer as the uptight Merideth. This is without a doubt her best performance to date. She's so funny, and awkward, and you almost hate her and then feel very sorry for her. The rest of the family is perfectly cast. Diane Keaton steals every scene with her performance as the outspoken, independent, yet caring mom Sybil Stone. Craig T. Nelson plays the often overwhelmed but ever trying Father Kelly Stone. Keaton and Nelson have good chemistry and are perfect as the head of the family. Luke Wilson plays the free spirited and encouraging brother Ben...who finds himself undeniably drawn to Merideth. Tyrone Giordano plays the gay and also deaf brother Thad which adds a lot to the plot of the family and the understanding of their tight knit group. It definitely adds something to the story to have a deaf character and have them all signing to each other. And then there is the incomparable and starlet herself Rachel McAdams as the very brash, outspoken sister Amy. Next to Parker she is the best in the film. Her chemistry and moments with Parker are hilarious and her one liners and funny moments will just kill you. Elizabeth Reaser rounds out the Stone family as the daughter who is starting a family with her own daughter and another son on the way. Each one of them play such an important role to the story and bring together this rowdy family that Merideth is trying to get into. Add in Claire Danes as Merideth's support system and sister Julie who Everett soon discovers is his match.Writer and director Thomas Bezucha has created such amazing characters and creates this family that everyone relates to or at least one of the characters or events. It's a true family get together with all the positives and negatives. From love blossoming to love ending, to old love and new love, to sibling rivalry, family, Christmas, gifts, cooking, and losing the one who holds you all together...everything...and it's just so enjoyable and funny and cute and a little taboo at times even. Some of the best scenes are the fight between Luke Wilson's character Ben and Dermot Mulroney's character Everett, the kitchen scene with Sarah Jessica Parker, Diane Keaton and Rachel McAdams, and every scene with Sarah Jessica Parker. She does such an incredible job. The ending is brilliantly done and wraps everything up so nicely and even with a rather sad twist still manages to give you a happy ending. There isn't anything not enjoyable about this film. If you don't see it this year you absolutely must check this one out next Christmas because it's an absolutely beautiful Christmas movie that will make you laugh and cry and want to see it again and again!! 9/10",The Family Stone
16,MLDinTN,Don't be misled...,5,26 December 2006,"This is not a comedy; it's more of a relationship drama. Everett is bringing home his work-focused, nerdy girlfriend to meet the family. From the beginning, his family already has a dislike toward her and isn't very welcoming. Meredith doesn't do herself any favors by telling boring stories and being all prim and proper. She doesn't know how to let loose and have a good time. Everrett really doesn't do much to stick up for her either. He doesn't even insist she stay when she decides to move to the Inn. At the dinner table, she does a good job of sticking her foot in her mouth when discussing gay issues with the gay son and family.But what is really out there story wise, is as soon as Everett sees Meredith's sister, Julie, he goes all ga ga over her and is in love. Just hours before, he was looking at engagement rings, now he is falling all over Julie. And Meredith gets drunk on the town with Ben, Everett's brother, and falls for him. The film gives no reason as to why Ben would see Meredith as his type and not to mention she is dating his brother. It's all weird because why does the family except Meredith when she is with the other son. Plus, you do not go after your sister's boyfriend 2 minutes after they break up. It's just so unrealistic.FINAL VERDICT: It was fair for a drama, but the Stones are a mean family and not likable. Plus it used misleading advertisements because it is not a comedy.",The Family Stone

Brother Ben Stone suspects there is and befriends Meredith with kindness...and maybe something more. Meredith's sister has just been invited to the house, also and comes off as kind, sweet contrast to Meredith. What other secrets and happenings will be occurring at the Stone house this Christmas? This lovely film is a perfect blend of tenderness and rib-tickling fun. All of the principal actors shine abundantly and the script is awe-inspiring, to say the very least. All of the secondary elements, costumes, setting, and more, are very worthy, too. This is one film that will have you laughing at every turn, even as your cheeks get wet simultaneously.

Luke Wilson steals a lot of the scenes here with his hilarious performance and Sarah Jessica parker actually did a pretty good job here, even though her character was irritating for the most part , plus it had some great heartwarming moments as well!. What I didn't like about the ending was is that Claire Danes(Julie Morton) and Dermot Mulroney fell in love way too soon, after one day together??, it just seemed to unbelievable for me, however all that a aside I was really pleased with the way this film turned out!,plus Craig T.

Dermot Mulroney is OK here as Everett, and did decent for the most part its just I didn't care for his character all that much,as he was a bit too whiny and wimpy for my tastes, although he had good chemistry with both Parker and Danes. Rachel McAdams is incredibly gorgeous!, and is amazing here, she may have had a very snobby and bitchy character but she did it with likability, unlike Sarah Jessica Parker(who did a good job), just managed to have a certain charm about her as she cracked me up throughout, and like Keaton was one of the main reasons this movie worked so well! (McAdams Rules!!!!!!!!). Sarah Jessica Parker is very good here, and did surprisingly well, her character irritated the crap out of me though, and I found it hard to generate any sympathy for her, she still did good though. Craig T. Nelson is absolutely wonderful as the Father, he was so likable and had a ton of presence, I was really glad to see him again, as I love this guy! (Nelson Rules!!). Luke Wilson is hilarious here, I am a big fan of his, and he managed to bring a lot of laughs into the film with his bizarre but hilarious character!. Claire Danes is gorgeous and did really well here, she was likable and had a good character, I liked her lots. Tyrone Giordano(Thad Stone),Brian J. White(Patrick Thomas),Paul Schneider(Brad Stevenson),Elizabeth Reaser(Susannah Stone Trousdale) all do what they have to do very well. Rest of the cast are fine. Overall this is an excellent film only does the finale disappoint somewhat go check it out you may be surprised like I was!. ****1/2 out of 5",The Family Stone
20,tabuno,Just Misses Being Great,8,18 January 2019,"27 November 2010. Before RACHEL GETTING MARRIED (2008) and MARGOT AT THE WEDDING (2007), there was THE FAMILY STONE which depicts a family drama with comedic sizzle that portray typical families during special events. Together with AMERCIAN BEAUTY (1999) and THE ICE STORM (1997), these feature film drama have attempted to depict the emotive relational turmoil and connections between people in close knit social dynamics. The FAMILY STONE is both a popular mass feature with original casting of Sarah Jessica Parker in one of her best starring roles, a great departure from her television SEX AND THE CITY persona and whose role is one of the most fascinating depictions of a female character in a family drama. There is a compelling anti-captivating relational presentation particularly in the first two-thirds of the movie. There is also a gay theme that is both intensely biting and yet interestingly political correct and perhaps one of the weaknesses in this movie is the overly perfect presentation of a gay couple in the movie as if to counter the relatively harsh treatment earlier in the movie. Oddly predictable, this movie nevertheless takes the usual formulaic plot and adds some substantive and creative enhancements usually being very careful not to descend into slapstick (the messy kitchen scene). There are a few editing issues, like with a later bedroom scene after a night on the town which seems to be a little to vague or confusing, the night in the car (a ""very cold"" night in a car with the engine not running scene?), and then there is the absence of one of the main characters in an important climatic scene that wasn't really carefully developed, and the leaving bus scene towards the end that might have been treated differently if no was left standing...it seemed that there was both an overly IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE coziness breaking the more serious, independent film drama even though there was also a more somber theme underlying the last scene. Overall, this was a great Sarah Jessica Parker performance and a solid cinematic achievement, though it just misses being a great one.",The Family Stone
21,Rodrigo_Amaro,Definitely one of the worst films ever made,1,4 March 2011,"Usually, I have the tendency of not liking this Christmas themed films because Hollywood is saturated of them, there's plenty of them and I had enough. If you wanna make a film with Christmas as a background to more dramatic stories okay, I'll watch it. ""Johns"" is a clear case of a film that uses Christmas without showing a colorful world with neon burning bright on your face. This is just a example. I took my chances with ""The Family Stone"" thinking ""with a cast like that you can't go wrong even with a holiday project"". WRONG! In the following lines you'll read all about the failure of this painful experience of which I forced myself to watch so that you, reader and perhaps future viewer, don't have to do it yourself.In short words: Dermot Mulronet brings his girlfriend Sarah Jessica Parker to meet his family on Christmas and it turns out to be a disaster because Diane Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Craig T. Nelson and unlimited company hates this woman out of nowhere, with no reason at all, and they show to her this side, and Sarah plays a fast talker, a bit introverted figure with few confidence on herself, to the point of calling her sister (Claire Danes) to assist her during this painful holiday.A movie based on disrespect amidst different people AND trying to make funny of it is not my style. A serious film about the subject I can get it, I can watch and might enjoy it depending on the way it portrays the situation, now a comedy, that is meant to be funny and doesn't succeed it in that because is demanding cruel and offensive to the viewers I simply have to repudiate.This garbage is a disrespect to people who have self-confidence; it is a disrespect even higher for those who lack of confidence. It is low in the lowest scale; an awful, vile, disgusting and repulsive experience. The Christmas spirit must have escaped from this, there is none, nothing that you can really enjoy or share with your family and friends. Santa Claus and the reindeer's run away from this comedy or something, that's why this is a Christmas flick with no laughs, charm or anything worth seeing.The saddest part of all this repressive behavior presented in the film is that this is a dominating trend in our society. This is really sad and sad again. We're becoming more suspicious, creating strange criterion for judging people because of everything they do without even knowing them. To some people this is just a normal thing, they're get used to see it in life so to these same people this trash might be funny. To me, it is a horrible waste of everything I can think of. Here comes some examples of why this film sucked.The dinner scene, where Sarah Jessica talks and talks without finding the right words to express herself about how difficult is to be gay and to have a gay son (reference of one of the Stone's family member and his boyfriend) was insulting. Not what she was trying to do but the family hysterical reactions, shouting at her, punching the table, sad expressions and all. I hated this scene so much! What happened to the expression ""be receptive""? These people never gave Sarah a chance to present herself, they judge and judge her again, they're so closed, trapped in their own little worlds and securities that they forgot that they're not perfect, and actually, they're annoying.""The Family Stone"" gets even lower with a unfair subplot concerning Diane Keaton's character with a fragile health condition that seems to intervene with the family reactions to the girl. Aw, I forgot to mention that when Claire Danes appears in the story everybody likes her immediately. Again, what was the criterion used by all these morons?Last complaint: what the hell was wrong with non-deaf family who kept communicating between themselves with sign language all the time? There are times when they're signing to each other, and in the same moment they're talking and we don't know who is deaf and who doesn't. But the worst of all is that for liberal characters as they all seem to be they are very on a conservative way, rejecting what's new and not open minded at all as they seem. So, the film denied itself from here.About the acting: The cast is only here for the money, no other excuse and we get what they think we deserve: a careless film poorly and careless written about careless people with nothing to say.I forced myself to watch this up to the ending to see how bad it could be, or how good it tried to be. A torture of the senses, a clouded and rainy sky in my world that only shone a little closer to the ending after a scene where all the characters are in the kitchen running away, slipping on the dessert that fell on the floor, laughing of themselves. I laughed a little in this part, but it was something that could sound like a ironic sound of a ""haha"". Sad, sad, sad and sad again.It gets 1 star for including the beautiful song ""Count on Me"" by Jefferson Starship in the closing credits. If it wasn't for that it might get no star at all after all the pain and misery I've been through. 1/10",The Family Stone
22,jzappa,The Epitome of Feel-Good Fluff,6,20 December 2006,"The Family Stone is maybe the first good feel-good family-themed or holiday-themed film for a long time, though its characters' quarrels are so ambiguous that any audience could take them in the wrong direction. Take the scene at the dinner table, when Sarah Jessica Parker's tightly wound businesswoman fiancée of Dermot Mulroney's first-born son is engaging in the conversation, despite her knowledge that the loosey-goosey family is giving her a hard time, concerning the deaf gay son's decision to have a child with his black boyfriend. After Diane Keaton's contemptuous mother wishes that all of her sons were gay so that they wouldn't leave her, Parker tries to say that certainly she doesn't hope for her son to be gay, because life as a homosexual is surely much more difficult, and it's not good to wish that upon him. From the moment she says that Keaton certainly doesn't hope for the son to be gay, the whole table is agog and offended terribly, looking down upon her as she nervously tries to finish her point, which really is not a slur against homosexuals at all. What it is is more of a perspective of the conditions of homosexual life in America, but the family is too fixated negatively on her to give her a chance. The ambiguity lies in the bull's-eye-hitting realism in the reactions of the family. This is how many people would react, and the audience may react similarly to what she says, even when she later exclaims how much she loves gay people and was only trying to make a point.That is not only an almost ridiculously specific flaw in the film, but also an example of why it was hard for me to grow to care for the family Stone. Throughout most of the film, caring for them is like caring for that family we all were shocked that Ben Stiller could endure so much of in Meet the Parents. They are so judgmental and so snobby in their resentment of Parker's nearly neurotic restraint and businesslike organization of things that it's as if they are all bratty schoolyard children. It boiled my blood almost to see the mother and father joining in on the prideful bash on the bookish new girl. However, this kind of entanglement of the characters, though ambiguous as I say, pulls one so much deeper into the action. We care a lot more about what's going on. When an argument grows so far out of hand that the family disperses and everyone is left to reflect on their situations and their actions, calms the viewer down with them, and reserves a tender spot for the mother, no matter how rude and immature she's been, and an understanding for the flashes of intelligence shown by the emotionally flexible and insightful father, no matter how misplaced his anger had been.My stern take on The Family Stone should hopefully not make you forget that it's generally a comedy. Parker is hilarious when her character unwinds, especially her impulsive inflections. Luke Wilson, the easiest character to get along with, is dryly funny entirely by comparison to the rest of the family. Rachel McAdams gives the best performance I've seen from her. I rarely pay her much admiration when I see her, like in Red Eye, when Cillian Murphy stole every scene from her and in Wedding Crashers when she had one of the corniest token romantic interest roles of recent memory. The Family Stone, though not a hard hitter, shows her capability for more hard-hitting work.",The Family Stone

24,meeza,You do not have to be stoned to enjoy this one!,8,5 September 2006,"""The Family Stone"" was embodied with so many rolling emotional characters that it would not be inapt to call them The Rolling Stones. The all-star stoners include: Willie Nelson, Woody Harrelson, George Michael, Michelle Rodriguez, Robert Downey Jr, and Courtney Love. Oops! Wrong Cast! That one is actually the one for the reality version of ""The Family Stoned"". OK, enough! In reality or I should say not reality, ""The Family Stone"" all-star cast includes Sarah Jessica Parker, Dermot Mulroney, Diane Keaton, Craig T. Nelson, Luke Wilson, Claire Danes, and Rachel McAdams. Not too shabby. Keaton and Nelson play Mr. & Mrs. Stone. While McAdams, Wilson, and Mulroney play the little Stoners. The premise of the film focuses on the Parker character, Meredith Morton. She is an uptight New York ""yupette"" who is nervous on meeting her boyfriend Everett Stone's chameleon family. The Stones don't inhale her egoistic demeanor and judgmental viewpoints. There are other underlying plot lines that unravel in ""The Family Stone"". The film is based during the holiday season , and it does have its merry moments combined with those tear-drenching hanky ones. Writer-Director Thomas Bezucha has assembled a valuable holiday film in our present convoluted era for dealing with family issues. I especially enjoyed the acting performances of Luke Wilson as the free spirit Ben Stone and Rachel McAdams as the nit-picking Amy Stone. Watching ""The Family Stone"" is a nice way to celebrate Christmas and ""ring"" out the New Year. **** Good",The Family Stone

Sarah Jessica Parker is an absolute mess here and super fun to watch, she steals the movie actually which surprised the hell out me because she doesn't usually have that much range.A touching comedy about an uptight, ultra conservative businesswoman (ice queen) who accompanies her boyfriend to his outgoing and screwy family's annual Christmas celebration. He has plans to propose, she is overwhelmed by the hostile reception.Great extended cast too, including Craig T. Nelson & Diane Keaton as the parents with Rachel McAdams, Dermot Mulroney, Elizabeth Reaser and Luke Wilson as the kids and (an underused) Claire Danes. I enjoyed everyone's character here and was entertained by the mayhem throughout, even surprised by some of the events. Great acting from all amid moments of humour and even some heartbreak (Keaton has a couple of very raw scenes). 12/23/14",The Family Stone
26,noralee,Amusing and Poignant Family Gathering Fades with Too Much Blandness and Predictability,5,2 January 2006,"""The Family Stone"" has some original dialog and flair with a mostly sprightly ensemble in a promising set piece of bringing the significant other home for the holidays, which movies, wrongly, usually think is only rife with potential when there are ethnic or racial differences.Writer/director Thomas Bezucha has created an intact New England counterpart to the liberal, intellectual, bon mots flame-throwing family in ""The Squid and the Whale.""The cast enjoys playing against type. The black sheep of this family is the tie-wearing Wall Street-type, compared to the others' employment in various artsy or nonprofit or educational activities. Tightly bunned Sarah Jessica Parker is the opposite of her pixies in ""Honeymoon in Vegas"" and ""L.A. Story,"" though we just know she's going to get drunk at some point. Diane Keaton is not ""Annie Hall,"" but an Earth Mother Matriarch. The incandescent Rachel McAdams is no ingénue as in ""The Notebook"" and ""Slings and Arrows"" but a cynical, intellectual snob take on her ""Mean Girls."" Craig T. Nelson is, as usual, an ineffectual father who, of course, finally bestirs himself, but has no ""Coach""-bluster. Paul Schneider has a comparably sized role as in ""Elizabethtown"" and adds charming warmth to the proceedings.The weakest part of the ensemble, as scripted, is the too perfect gay couple, each of whom is almost completely devoid of any personality, quirks or individuality compared to the rest of the eccentrics in the family. As the deaf partner, Gallaudet graduate Tyrone Giordano played a similarly angelic brother in ""A Lot Like Love."" No way did I believe the African-American's partner's claim that the family had initially razzed him, as he's even more blandly proper than Sidney Poitier in ""Guess Who's Coming To Dinner.""I'm not sure why the equally bland pregnant sister is so mesmerized by gay icon Judy Garland mournfully singing ""Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas"" from ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" in the extended excerpt we see her watching on the TV. Unless this has something to do with the rather odd and strained family conversation around the dinner table of the straight sons joshing that mom tried to turn them gay, which turns into the film's dramatic turning point. This churns up too schematic results, though Claire Danes does have nice chemistry with Dermot Mulroney. The film takes a somewhat typical sad, revelatory turn, but handles it in a less saccharine way than most such films (and giving many in the audience a good tip for future family gifts).The set and production design were excellent at capturing the family's background, as well as the use of the Connecticut and New Jersey locations. The score is a mostly uncreative pastiche of Christmas songs, though a passage from ""The Nutcracker"" is used amusingly to emphasize the physical parlor comedy routines.",The Family Stone
27,davispittman,A Pleasant Surprise!,7,13 November 2015,"The Family Stone (2005) surprised me in a very good way. All of the actors did very well with the script and with both the funny and dramatic scenes. Sarah Jessica Parker earned a golden globe nomination for this movie, very well deserved! Sarah nailed both her dramatic and humorous dialogue in the various scenes. Of course Diane Keaton did very well in her own character, along with Craig T. Nelson (Poltergeist). Rachel McAdams did a great job as well, and Claire Danes was my favorite character in the entire movie. The script, storyline, and dialogue between characters was all very sharp and well written in my opinion. This movie actually has some pleasing surprises and twists that you definitely do not see coming, at least I didn't! Overall this is a fun, entertaining, funny, dramatic, well acted, and well written holiday film that will warm your heart and for sure make you laugh! 7/10 for The Family Stone.",The Family Stone
28,EUyeshima,Keaton and Others Shine Even Though the Predictable Plot Turns Divert Any Genuine Interest,5,9 May 2006,"Writer-director Thomas Bezucha has assembled such a strong, surprisingly compatible ensemble cast that you root for him to produce a holiday classic blending family comedy hi-jinks and soap opera pathos. However, his mixed bag screenplay does not quite hit its marks, especially the predictable fish-out-of-water set-up that dominates the first half of the film. Set mainly in a wintry New England household right out of a Hallmark Christmas card, the story revolves around the Stone family's holiday preparations, which focuses on the arrival of oldest son Everett who is bringing his intended fiancée Meredith with him.The decidedly raffish Stones are a close-knit, exclusionary clan who have an immediate discomfort with the tightly wound Meredith, an obsessed prig of an overachiever who does not like to be touched or cajoled into situations where she doesn't have full control. Everett's need to look and act perfect is the reason why he is drawn to her, but the family sees an obvious mismatch, especially the salty, take-no-prisoners matriarch Sybil. Everett's snappish sister Amy already hates Meredith from a previous encounter, but laid-back brother Ben is oddly sympathetic to Meredith's outsider status. Meredith seeks emotional reinforcement by begging her sister Julie to come join her. There is also Everett's pregnant sister Susannah with young daughter in tow, as well as Thad, the ebullient youngest son who happens to be deaf, gay and trying to adopt a child with partner Patrick.That's quite a few characters to track over the course of a 102-minute movie, and one of the main challenges for me is to feel engaged enough with their individual dilemmas. For a holiday film, I do like how the Stones are portrayed not as pretentiously convivial but more as a dynamic, temperamental family unit. Bezucha provides one surprisingly powerful dinner table scene where Meredith makes an unfortunate comment about Thad that she fruitlessly tries to justify to an increasingly enraged Sybil. This oddly insular 2005 film could have used more scenes with the emotional honesty of that exchange, but it unfortunately defaults to well worn comedy elements to ensure the viewer is not put off. Even the poignant ending feels slightly disingenuous for the stacked-deck approach to the inevitable fate of one of the key characters.The acting is mainly solid, though in a few cases, quite predictable, and in one case, affecting to the point of transcendent. As Meredith, Sarah Jessica Parker seems to overplay her unlikable role toward stereotype. Besides, her straight-laced character's transformation is just a little too jarring to be believable, as she first channels Miranda and then shifts to Carrie in a flash. Dermot Mulroney seems to be stuck in a rom-com rut playing the handsome leading man yet again, though as Everett, he does manage a few moments that delve more than skin-deep toward the end of the film.As comic foil Ben, Luke Wilson seems to be doing a parody of his brother Owen. Back in ""Mean Girls"" mode, Rachel McAdams makes a vivid impression as the vitriolic Amy, while Claire Danes, despite an introductory pratfall of no consequence, is called on to be either supportive or smitten as Julie. It's good to see Craig T. Nelson again (even though we certainly heard him in ""The Incredibles"") as he plays family patriarch Kelly with sympathetic aplomb, but it is the redoubtable Diane Keaton who makes her moments count in likely her best dramatic part since ""Marvin's Room"". In what could have been a stoically masochistic role, she provides sharp bite and torrents of mother love with honest fervor.The DVD has a surprisingly robust set of features starting with two commentary tracks - a spotty, anecdotal one by Parker and Mulroney, and the other a somewhat more informative one by Bezucha, producer Michael London, editor Jeffrey Ford, and production designer Jane Ann Stewart. There are also three featurettes - two brief Fox Movie Channel specials focused on the casting and the movie's premiere, a Q&A session with much of the cast, a rather dull gag reel and relatively worthless deleted scenes. There is even a recipe for Meredith's wholly unappetizing strata included.",The Family Stone
29,pensman,Worse than passing a stone.,1,18 June 2006,"How bad can a film get? The Family Stone certainly provides a bar of least achievement on which to judge others. Based on a cliché, that uptight snob just needs to get laid, Thomas Bezucha writes and directs the liberal politically correct equivalent of what happens when the Barones, Everybody Loves Raymond, meet the Byrnes, Meet the Parents. For a moment forget that was done in Meet the Fockers.What a cast of characters the Stone family is. We have a dying mother, Diane Keaton. A loosey goosey son stumbling his way through life, Luke Wilson. A bitter sister whose love interest hasn't kept in contact since deflowering her, Rachel McAdams. A deaf brother who is also gay and has a black significant other, Tyrone Giordano. A patriarch who tries to be a voice of reason, Craig T. Nelson. And of course the uptight normal son making his way in the real world but who is marrying the wrong girl, Dermot Mulroney. Into this sour mash of liberal posturing we bring the innocent victim representing everything this wonderful family sees as counter their culture, Sarah Jessica Parker.A fairly bright middle schooler who stumbled into this film could easily determine the plot permutations after the first fifteen minutes. There are no surprises in this almost unwatchable film. One can even see the Craig T. Nelson character occasionally channeling his more familiar persona Coach Hayden Fox.Not since Terms of Endearment have I cheered for disease. Thankfully disease wins and Diane Keaton is absent in what is supposed to be a weepy ending.Go watch Meet the Fockers again.

30,aharmas,Warm and Touching,9,29 December 2005,"It's always surprising to see a film where reality is actually portrayed, and there are flawed, bitter, and imperfect characters. There is some cutesy stuff, but it's not aiming to please every person in the audience. This film actually endorses love, but it also shows that it comes along with plenty of obstacles.Nothing is perfect, and communication unfortunately is not one of humanity's best skills. In the film, many of the siblings apparently are supportive of each other, and yet they don't know really know each other. There is a strong bond among them, and now apparently there is something wrong at its very core.What a cast! Mulroney, Keaton, Nelson, Adams, Wilson, Parker, etc. All do strong work, and in some cases, take chances with characters that might not appeal or please many in the audience. I was very happy to see that actors like Keaton still get a chance to show us how amazing they can be. I have always been a fan of hers, and she is one of the great ladies of cinema.The film tells us to look at each other and be honest, and then, maybe we'll find a little happiness.",The Family Stone
31,dierregi,Meredith and the cannibals,5,20 November 2010,"""The family Stone"" is a film about an unbearable, snobbish and pretentious family. They are more politically correct than the god of Political Correctness; therefore they feel much superior to anybody. The matriarch of the family is Sybil, a monstrous creature, played by Diane Keaton. The patriarch is a mild (spineless?) guy. They have five children, all of them slightly unpleasant. The most unpleasant of them being the youngest, Amy, played by Mc Adams. The plot revolves around Everett, their eldest son, who brings home for Christmas Meredith, the woman he would like to marry (played by an outstanding Parker). Amy is the only family member who met Meredith once and she hated her on the spot, so she is manipulating her family into hating her, too. The reasons of her hatred are difficult to grasp for me. Meredith seems to be an efficient, reserved, hardworking woman. Perhaps introverted and a bit cold. But are those reasons enough to hate somebody? Apparently yes, especially in the US, where introverted people are treated like the worst creatures – even in these disgraceful PC times. For the Stones, no sin is as bad as being reserved and not wanting to be hugged by perfect strangers. Given that it was impossible for me to understand the hatred of the family against Meredith, or to appreciate the ""screwball"" qualities of said family, I found difficult to follow the whole movie. The Stone are supposed to ""eccentric"", but they seem to me obnoxious and aggressive. It is easier to take side with the more vulnerable character, the poor Meredith who finds herself all alone (not much support from her feeble boyfriend Everett) stranded in an island inhabited by metaphorical cannibals. However, after a long series of humiliations and cringe-inducing scenes, all ends sort of well. If you consider ""well"" your almost-to-be-husband is falling on the spot for your sister and pursuing her the same day he bought you an engagement ring Keaton is such a likable actress that disliking her is quite difficult. Also, given the circumstances, her character calls for sympathy, but I honestly hated Sybil more than Meredith. At the beginning of the movie I thought Sybil suffered from early Alzheimer or dementia, so outlandish were her remarks – such as telling a perfect stranger about a guy who ""popped Amy's cherry"" is that the sort of talk of a mother about her daughter? Distasteful, more than free-spirited and I definitely would not want my mother to talk about my sex life. By chance I watched this movie just after having seen on TV ""Dan in real life"". They are both comedies involving large families and holidays. They are both mediocre movies, but ""The family Stone"" is just slightly better than ""Dan"", although after having seen both, I wonder why anybody bother to go home and see the family for the holidays. It looks like an excruciatingly painful experience to me.",The Family Stone
32,Sherazade,Nice but...,7,9 September 2006,"This is a very Christmassy tale of family life we probably can all relate too and for a second or so the writers and director or whatever had a good thing going until their started overdoing it a little. Everett Stone (played by Dermot Mulroney) is the eldest son of the Stone family and we meet him bringing his new girlfriend, Meredith Morton (played by the ever shiny Sarah Jessica Parker) home for the holidays. Rachel McAdams, plays Amy Stone the family's last born and the only one who has met Meredith before and we meet her filling the family in on how shallow and vain Merdith is. Diane Keaton, Sybil Stone is the mother a crowd pleaser and also the family buffer, she just wants to see her children happy and have peace around her so she indulges everyone for as long as it will last. Craig T. Nelson, is the dad, Kelly Stone who just follows along whatever his wife is feeling or believing. Tyrone Giordano, play Thad Stone who is hard of hearing and because of this the family has beautifully learned sign language and it is incorporated well into every scene that he's in. All will not be complete without the weird son, Ben Stone and he is played by Luke Wilson. Okay all of this I didn't have a problem with because it sounds like any other family but when the plot twisted, so did the suspension of my disbelief. When Meredith arrives at the house, nobody really likes her and Everett tries to make her believe that it's all in her head but it soon becomes apparent that it isn't. When mishap after mishap occurs, and Meredith (a woman who doesn't know how or when to shut up) gets fed up, she leave the Stone house and checks into the nearest hotel. Then she telephones her sister, Julie Morton (played by Claire Danes) to come down from Newyork to console her. When Julie gets down there, Meredith asks Everett to pick her up from the bus depot and when he does, sparks begin to fly between the two of them. Meanwhile, sparks have begun to fly between the weird son as Meredith as well. It all just seemed too good to be true and too overwhelming to be borne all at once. And if you haven't had enough of that, they add to the fact (which is also overshadowed by everything else going on) the fact the Sybil Stone is dying of cancer. Oh! in all of that, I forgot to mention that there is another sister, Susannah Stone Trousdale played by Elizabeth Reaser. Phew!",The Family Stone
33,nycritic,The Anal and the Liberal,10,11 January 2006,"Meredith Morton is not the kind of woman you would call relaxed in social settings. She gets the case of the dry-throats which can result in her trying to clear it, and any attempt to alleviate her awkwardness results in her digging an even bigger hole for herself. And to top it all, she is the fiancée of Everett Stone, and he is about to do the criminal: introduce her to his family.The Stones are the kind of family anyone would want to be a part of. Liberal minded almost to idealistic extremes, nothing is sacred with them, not the sexual escapades of youngest daughter Amy by one Brad Stevenson which mother Sybil casually makes a reference to (as if this were the latest recipe for apple crumb cake), not brother Ben's fondness for pot and nudity, and certainly not Thad's gayness and interracial lover Patrick and their intentions to adopt.So why the hostility towards Meredith? Because, as Amy points out and they all come to witness, she's just wrong in more ways than one and Everett, whom they all love, is about to make a grave mistake in marrying her. Meredith lacks the warmth and spontaneity that makes for a complete human being and is a complete control freak who is as incapable of letting loose as they are incapable of being stuffed shirts. Matters get complicated when Meredith calls on her sister Julie and she reveals to be as different from Meredith as day is to night: she's the real deal. And something barely mentioned among the Stones, simmering below the surface has Sybil vehemently opposed to even the thought of Meredith becoming a part of her family.THE FAMILY STONE certainly has moments of hilarity and is being marketed as a romantic comedy, but it really has a little too much emotional gravitas to be considered as such. Maybe a dramedy should fit it better. Either/or, it's a very poignant film that manages to touch sensitive issues such as terminal disease and gay parenting without ever hammering it in. If the time frame weren't so fixed where the story lines must be solved come Christmas it is possible that it were a shade more believable, but in the tradition of Christmas movies, it's all about the magic and wonder and situations finding closure.Despite a sizable cast, there isn't a role that feels underwritten. Sarah Jessica Parker, in her first starring role since SEX AND THE CITY, plays against her girlish type and becomes Meredith Morton -- a woman too severe for her own good, too shrill for a family so lax. Diane Keaton also plays somewhat against her intellectual type and shows what a mother's anger can do when a nasty comment is made. Keaton's interaction with Craig T. Nelson is so heartfelt one could think they have been married in real life for over thirty years. Rachel MacAdams has a field day playing a character whose messiness and blunt nature clashes in every aspect with Meredith's uptightness. Claire Danes has a role reminiscent of Donna Reed -- natural, girlish, wholesome -- again a total opposite to Parker, and necessary to make Parker stand out as a sore thumb. Dermot Mulroney and Luke Wilson also find the right notes in their characters: one wanting to make something of himself and believing that marrying an anal woman will grant him that, the other a sensitive man hiding under an apparent facade of neo-hippiness.THE FAMILY STONE is a genuine, heartfelt movie that will satisfy people looking for the right holiday film and despite its political correctness manages to be nicely subversive while also reviving Christmas films from the 40s, such as MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS and THE MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER.",The Family Stone

35,Matt_Layden,"The Family Stone Delivers, Even With It's Bogus Sub-Plots",7,5 January 2006,"The Stone family get together for the Christmas holidays and one of their son's is bringing home his uptight girlfriend, with the hope of proposing. When the family takes it one step too far with the hostility towards her, she brings in her sister for comfort. This happens to cause more complications then solutions.The Family Stone tries to pass itself off as a Christmas Holiday comedy, when it is totally different. The laughs are there, but it's not laugh out loud funny, instead the film is filled with more emotion then you will find in any other film this Christmas Season, that's if you have no love for a giant ape.Bezucha has the support of a great cast. Graig T Nelson and Diane Keaton, as the parents, their pain in the ass daughter, Rachel McAddams, pregnant daughter, Elizabeth Reaser, weed smoking son, Luke Wilson, gay and Deaf son, Tyrone Giordano and of course their business man son, Dermot Mulroney, who's girlfriend is non other then Sarah Jessica Parker and her sister Claire Danes...did you get all that?The Family Stone is indeed funny, but it's not necessarily the material that makes it funny, it's the amazing cast, that brings life to the jokes and craziness that this family is. Within the whole family, Luke Wilson and Rachel McAddams stand out, as basically the exact opposite to how they feel to Parker. McAddams hates her guts and Wilson has feelings for her. That single element to the film is one of the negatives.Stone is a good film that has good laughs, but there is an underground feeling of sorrow in it. The film is more about the characters within the family then it is about the mishaps of Parker and the family. Once Parker's sister arrives, and you see the look Mulroney gives, you know exactly what the outcome of the film will be. This sub-plot is just too unbelievable to be taken seriously and takes the film down a notch because it's simply bogus and would never happen.One scene that I laughed in which was not suppose to happen was the slow-motion part of Mulroney walking back home with a smile on his face. It's goofy and inappropriate for this type of film. I was having fun with the film and emotionally attached to it, until that scene and the final ending. The ending is suppose to be one of the sad parts of the entire film, but when you see it coming it really has no effect because in some cases you just want it to get over with.Stone will have you laugh and possibly cry, but will also have you cursing out at some of the goofy and unbelievable scenes. With those aside, Stone is able to deliver the goods.",The Family Stone
36,pc95,"Had a few moments, but otherwise blah",4,20 January 2009,"Christmas ""dramedies"" like these need to be weeded out better. The Family Stone is clichéd blah with a few good moments - not nearly enough to save the movie. The only really entertaining part in the whole movie was the bar-scene with the Parker and Wilson, and that dialog. Otherwise, it's painful watching supposedly funny situations of clashing of ""normal"" family smearing ""bratty"" gf and all the ridiculous antics and dialog that ensue. The problem with many of these movies come when it throws comedy in one scene, but tries to mix in heart-felt drama in other scenes....it's risky and while working on some occasions doesn't do on the whole. The result is we're subjected to clichéd garbage and contrived BS. As if it's interesting to listen to venting and rumor-mill talk behind one's back. The ending is utter crap with sisters and brothers swapping each other as well.....not recommended.",The Family Stone

Meredith is coldly and hostilely welcomed by the family Stone, and feeling completely uncomfortable, she decides to call her sister Julie to stay with her. Along Christmas, revelations and new feelings are disclosed.I have finally got the time to see this film. I've always wanted to in a long time (well, two year ago) and I was fairly surprised with it. It's more than what you think it might be. This movie is a moving family drama/comedy.The comedic scenes were funny while the dramatic scenes will turn your emotions. The problem with parts of the movie is that it switches the tone. I think it would have been one of the best films in 2005 if they had less screwball comedy.There's also a thoughtful side to this film. It is the scenes between Diane Keaton and Craig T. Nelson are great. The ensemble's performances were also really good.The Family Stone is a great movie. It shows you the emotions and humor in this movie. The performances are realistic and the score is great. This fish-out-of-water movie isn't ground-breaking, but it sure is a holiday treat.",The Family Stone

39,KUAlum26,"Not exactly ""Holiday"" fare but...",8,10 June 2006,"...still possessing charm and warmth that one could plug into the Christmas/Chanukah/Kwanzaa/whatever season.Meredith Morton(Sarah Jessica Parker,as button-down as you've probably seen her since ""Sex and the City"")is an over-talkative,Type-A executive sort whose boyfriend,Everett Stone(Dermont MUlroney,dry as a bone)decides to take her to meet his folks. When they meet her,they are nearly unanimously turned off by her,particularly the ostensibly free and open-minded mother(Diane Keaton) and his acerbic younger sister Amy(Rachel McAdams). Pretty much the only person that ""gets"" her is laid-back filmmaker brother Ben(Luke Wilson,aptly cast). At first,Meredith tries to bend to conform to her hosts,trying to cook for them and appeal to their better graces. When that doesn't work(aided by her lack of self-control of opinion at the dinner table),she decides to check into an Inn and calls on her sister(Claire Danes)for succor. As it turns out,the sister appeals more to the Stones(of course),and Meredith is on the verge of imploding. Happy Holidays it appears not to be.A funny yet sober script by writer and director Thomas Bezucha plus good casting makes this movie neither syrupy or (too)crass. I have a somewhat vague recollection of the trailers for this movie,but in the defense of the people who made the trailers,I'd say that this is a hard movie to sum-ate in thirty or forty seconds:it's either a very serious comedy or a very funny drama. The producers and the studio had to make a decision,and they chose to go with pushing the ""funny"" avenue. Either way,this film is a slightly complicated attempt at mimicking real-life complications when personality types meet and clash,and as such,it's a pretty good attempt.",The Family Stone
40,Maciste_Brother,Dreadful film. Talk about having a bad time at the movies,1,24 July 2006,"Clichéd, overacted, badly written, clichéd, unoriginal, forced, clichéd, badly casted, improbable, clichéd, sappy, contrived, and yes, clichéd.Those are the words I would use to describe the almost unwatchable THE FAMILY STONE. I can't believe Hollywood still makes such corny movies in 2005. This is not the 1950s. All the characters were annoying to the nth degree. Not one likable character in the whole bunch. The cast is ridiculously crowded and could have used a few unknowns to give the whole project some breathing room.Dermot Mulroney playing Diane Keaton's oldest son made me laugh out loud. There's a 15 year difference between the two actors. Dermot simply looked too old to be Keaton's son.Having Claire Danes appear midway into the movie was just a stupid movie trick. Her presence just didn't make any sense. So was the idea of having Dermot falling for her even though he was about to marry SJP. But the last straw was the whole idea that the mother had an incurable disease. I mean, gimme a break.Anyway, please, avoid this unpleasant movie like the plague. It is by far the worst film I've seen in 2005.",The Family Stone
41,Philby-3,A light comedy about death,6,16 January 2006,"Meryl Streep pretty well wrote the book on how to play the gracious WASP mother dying nobly from cancer in ""One True Thing"" (1998) and Diane Keeton, capable actress that she is, does not have much to add here. While the plots are different the atmospheres of the two movies are remarkably similar. ""The Family Stone"" centres round a snowy New England family Christmas gathering while ""One True Thing"" had similar Christmas scenes. ""One True Thing""was in the ""return of the prodigal daughter"" mode while ""The Family Stone"" is in the ""meet the parents"" genre, and is more of a comedy, and at the end of the day the slighter piece.Sarah Jessica Parker's tactless intruder Meredith is remarkably effective because her manners are so alien and because she just looks so different  a skinny anxious ball of energy out of place in a family of puddings. However Claire Danes as Meredith's sister Julie, enrolled for moral support, comes across as attractive but rather flat  neither one thing nor the other. Dermot Mulroney as Everett the son who brings this whirlwind home has a tendency to disappear from scenes he is in. He is of course under the handicap that his feckless brother Ben (Luke Wilson) has all the charm and charisma he lacks. Rachel McAdams is very good as Amy, the punchy younger Stone sister.I'm not sure why we had to have another brother Thad who is deaf and gay (with a black partner)  he is important to the story only for one (very good) line from Mum, in response to a real clanger from Meredith, when she says if she had the choice she would like her children fault-free. Mum says to him ""we love you all the more dear' (which they clearly do). Dad, a college professor, played by Craig T Nelson, is an amiable sort not subject to the demons that pursued William Hurt's character in ""One True Thing"", but he tends to fade into the background also, along with the other sister whose husband is absent and the ambulance man who comes to Amy's rescue at the end.I think my basic problem is that though the storyline is neat and tidy, some characters simply drown out others; the script does not seem to allow for ensemble acting, and you finish up with a strong sense of some characters and very little of others even though some of the quieter parts are important to the story. The murky lighting did not help much either, even if it's authentic. Diane Keeton does a nice job as the saintly mum but it is not as an interesting a portrait as the great Meryl's portrayal, as noted earlier. ""One True Thing"" might have been more pretentious and had more big-name stars, but it also had the drama this movie lacks.",The Family Stone
42,blott2319-1,Brilliant and authentic Holiday film.,9,13 January 2021,"I was prepared to loathe The Family Stone from the first few scenes, because I was convinced that the entire film was going to be structured around the fact that the uptight girlfriend isn't so bad and everyone should stop picking on her. It doesn't help that this uptight girl was played by Sarah Jessica Parker, an actress that I have never liked. After meeting her and seeing how she fails to fit in with the Stones, I kind of agreed that she didn't belong there. So suffering through, as the movie tries to tell me to ""give her a chance,"" did not sound appealing. But as the film went on I realized they were allowing me to dislike her. In fact, sometimes she's completely off-base and offensive. Any movie that gives me permission to dislike SJP is already winning. Then they throw in some surprising romantic twists that I think bring the story around full circle in a lovely way. And there's even more to the story than that, because there are also some things going on within the family that are filled with drama, and that brought me to tears. I have always said that a movie which can make me cry because I am so emotionally invested in the story is instantly going to earn a higher rating from me. Not only did The Family Stone make me tear up, I was using up enough tissues that I had to pause the movie a couple times so I didn't miss anything.One aspect that has to be mentioned is the cast. There are so many talented people here and they all do great things with their performances. First of all, can we just agree that every movie should have Rachel McAdams in it from now on. I'm sorry, but I have yet to see a single disappointing or underwhelming performance from her. She is amazing in this movie, and somehow makes me like her character despite the fact that she is being so catty. Diane Keaton is perfect as the matriarch of the family, and I love how different her relationship is with each of her children. It's the little details like that which make this feel like a real family. I loved that there were a number of different issues within this family that they needed to deal with, and that the film took the time to address them all. Perhaps the one weak part was Elizabeth Reaser as the older sister who didn't have as much to do, but I appreciated her presence as someone who could emotionally support others in these difficult situations. I could go on gushing, but perhaps the best compliment I can give The Family Stone is that I will actively seek to make it part of my staple of Holiday movies that I watch every December. Sure, it will have to be on a day I'm ready for a good cry, but I don't mind one bit.",The Family Stone
43,fwomp,"Whine All You Like, It's Still a Good Movie",8,19 May 2006,"Whine, whine, whine! I hear nothing but whining from so many reviewers about this film that I feel like chasing after them with a big stick. ""The dysfunctional family gathering stories have been overdone,"" some say. ""It's trying to be a comedy, a drama, and a romance,"" others complain. ""Too many subplots,"" others lament.On the first complaint (""dysfunctional family films""), I'd have to agree. There are a TON of them out there (Look Who's Coming to Dinner, The Squid and the Whale, and In Her Shoes, just to give you a sprinkling.) But what does that have to do with the quality of THIS film? Nothing.On the second complaint (""too many genres""), I'd have to say, ""What the Hell are you talking about!"" The mixing of genres has been going on since celluloid productions started. And I don't really care if they mix genres as long as the story/script/acting is good  The Family Stone definitely had a great story/script/acting.And on the third and final complaint (""many subplots""), I'd have to say ""So what."" Subplots are an excellent way to let the story unfold without getting heavy handed with one of the other genres (i.e., too much drama versus excessive comedy).The story The Stone family is getting together for the Christmas season. Everett Stone (Dermot Mulroney) is bringing with him his girlfriend whom he has intentions of asking to marry during the family's gathering. Meredith Morton (Sarah Jessica Parker) is this fiancé-to-be and she's so uptight you think her head might pop off at any moment. Her type-A personality is extremely excessive, so much so that she wears perfectly fitting gray outfits, has her hair wound-up securely on her head, and rarely laughs or smiles. Meeting up with the Stone family, she's about to be head-dunked into a realm she's never before experienced. This new family has a gay, deaf son (Tyrone Giordano) whose partner is black (talk about a dynamic!), a daughter (Rachel McAdams) who's met Meredith and damages her reputation before she ever sets foot in the Stone home, the matriarch of the house (Diane Keaton) who's medical secret threatens to destroy this year's festivities, the patriarch (Craig T. Nelson) who's trying to hold the fraying ends of the family together, and finally we have Meredith's sister (Claire Danes) who's called in to act as a support person for Meredith but ends up getting more involved with the Stone family than she'd ever hoped.The beginning of the film is front-loaded with plenty of laughable moments. Sarah Jessica Parker's character (Meredith) has a nervous tic which involves clearing her throat, and this is used to great comedic advantage. The dialogue is also excellently laid out as we see Meredith say to one of the more obnoxious Stone family members, ""I don't care if you like me or not."" To which the Stone replies, ""Aw  of course you do."" As the film progresses, however, we get to see much more of the family's problems. Mother is very ill. Everett may not be in love with Meredith. Everett's brother has a ""thing"" for Meredith. And the list goes on. What makes this portion work is its realism. There are so many dynamics to this family. They don't have just one. Ever. You get in tight with the Stone family, whether you like it or not, and this can seem very uncomfortable to some viewers, especially those who can identify with one or more of the characters.And that's why this movie works. All of the actors (even Craig T. Nelson) don't force the issues. The Family Stone comes tumbling off the screen and it's funny, sad, irritating, beautiful, angering, spiteful it's family. Yes, it's been done before, but that doesn't mean you won't like this version. Give it try.",The Family Stone
44,jon.h.ochiai,Touching Family Stone,9,8 January 2006,"In the opening scene of ""The Family Stone"", we see Diane Keaton as Sybil Stone in a quiet moment in her living room amidst the wintry Christmas season. This is perhaps overt foreshadowing. Much of Writer/ Director Thomas Bezucha's ""The Family Stone"" is telegraphed and predictable; however, in the midst of this chaotic and smart comedy are poignant resolution. Bezucha's ""Family Stone"" is a pleasant surprise in that it dares to make the audience very uncomfortable, and has such great compassion. It is wonderful paradox. Diane Keaton is the amazing force and spirit of ""The Family Stone"". She is awesome. Keaton is part of a talented ensemble cast including Sarah Jessica Parker, Dermot Mulroney, Rachel McAdams, Craig T. Nelson, Claire Danes, and Luke Wilson.Writer Bezucha's story is deceiving. It feels much like a comedy, but not really as it resolves. Sybil and Kelly Stone (solid Craig T. Nelson) are expecting all their grown children home for Christmas. First to arrive is deaf gay son Thad (Tyrone Giordano) with his life partner Patrick (Brian J. White), a handsome black man. Bezucha is really good with creating narrative context. Amy (Rachel McAdams) arrives home with loads of laundry in hand. Pregnant Susannah (Elizabeth Reaser) with her daughter is already at the house. Apparently, her husband is joining the family later. Son Ben (laid back Luke Wilson) is still living at the StonesI think. Everyone, particularly Sybil, is awaiting the arrival of Everett (funny anal retentive Dermot Mulroney) and his up tight girlfriend Meredith (a bold and fearless Sarah Jessica Parker). Everett is a successful investment banker, and Meredith is his equal. Everett is planning to marry Meredith, but the entire family believes that she is all wrong for Everettespecially Mom Sybil. Meredith by being Meredith justifies this indictment. Things go so badly that Meredith enrolls her sister Julie (beautiful and enchanting Claire Danes) to stay with her over Christmas. The contrived romantic confusion is strangely predictable. Then again, that perhaps was never the primary focus of Bezucha's movie.Applaud Bezucha's screenplay for making us truly uncomfortable and for also creating touching commentary at the same time. Applaud too, Sarah Jessica Parker for being out there without a net as Meredith. She is so bold and completely vulnerable. Her Meredith is very smart, but not smart enough to know when just to shut the f up. Parker plays her perfectly as someone uncomfortable in her own skin, who deep down has a good heart. In a cruel joke Amy (McAdams) intentionally embarrasses Meredith in a game of charades. In the best and most difficult scene in the movie, Meredith argues ""nurture versus nature"" at the Christmas dinner table. It ends with Sybil (Keaton) proclaiming, ""Enough!"" The resolution is heartbreaking. Amazing scene. This is where ""The Family Stone"" transformed for me. Predictability and broad comedy aside, ""The Family Stone"" is about family, love, and compassion. Diane Keaton as Sybil loves all her children and only wants them to be happy. Keaton is so powerful in her understatement and quiet. Her objection to Meredith is that she is not the right one for Everett (Mulroney). All she needs to say to Everett is ""I am sick."" Diane Keaton is so strong. She is a true gift.We find both expected and unexpected surprises in Bezucha's ""The Family Stone"". Seasons change, and life goes on. ""The Family Stone"" survives with a wild sense of humor, nobility, and great love. That makes the movie itself a wonderful surprise.",The Family Stone
45,SmileysWorld,"The family aspects are appealing,the romantic aspects are not.",6,31 January 2006,"Every family has it's quirks.This is what I like about the family depicted in this film.They are imperfect,but not to the point of being dysfunctional.They represent most of the families that I know in reality.I especially enjoy Craig T. Nelson's portrayal of the family patriarch.He plays him as the calm and gentle voice of reason,which is a quality I wish I possessed.Beyond all of this,the movie falls flat, starting with the character played by Sarah Jessica Parker.I have no problem with her portrayal of the character,it's just the way she looks in the beginning of the film.She was given,through no fault of her own, a horrible look that is comparable to that of the wicked witch from The Wizard of Oz.I found this to be a bit extreme.Thank goodness they had her a little more normal looking toward the end.Above all,the romantic aspects of the film are nothing more than a tangled up mess.I enjoyed meeting the family,and may visit them again when they come to cable,but the romantic mishmash will keep me from adding them to my library.",The Family Stone
46,Danusha_Goska,Crisp Depiction of Holiday Family Dysfunction; Flawed but Enjoyable,7,2 January 2006,"I really enjoyed ""The Family Stone,"" in spite of its flaws. I'd like to see it again. It got mediocre reviews, but it did more for me than the big, important blockbusters this season.One scene alone in ""The Family Stone"" -- the dinner table / gay son scene -- has sparked more interesting conversation on internet bulletin boards than Spielberg's oh-so-important, magnum opus ""Munich."" The plot is pretty wispy: a tightly wound woman, Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker) visits her fiancée's (Dermot Mulroney)'s smug, politically correct family for the holidays.The Stones don't like Meredith, and so they are cruel to her, in more or less disguised ways. Because she has to make nice with her fiancée's family, and because she is a competitive person, Meredith sticks around through all the Stones' abuse.Plot complications arrive, in the form of star crossed love affairs, and one hidden family tragedy.In spite of the above description, ""The Family Stone"" rouses more laughter than tears, although it shoots for both.Who hasn't spent at least one nightmarish holiday in a perfectly decorated house, and over a perfectly prepared holiday meal, where daggers rather than candy canes are the weapons of choice? Rachel McAdams, who was boring to the point of invisibility in summer's ""Red Eye,"" plays a very mean woman here, and she is marvelous -- she could give Bette Davis a run for her money. Her petty, self righteous, politically correct huffiness and sadism are just perfectly depicted.The now notorious dinner party scene depicts the Stone family purposely misunderstanding an innocent comment that Meredith makes about gay people. First, the Stones, politically correct liberals that they are, encourage frank conversation. Then, when Meredith is frank, they all but set upon her with their forks. The irony with which this scene punctures politically correct ""open mindedness"" is wonderful.Alas, the movie is flawed. Its most interesting romantic coupling is given very short shrift. A key character is meant to be transformed by a very brief, and undermotivated, encounter. Clark Gable took almost all of ""It Happened One Night"" to work a similar transformation. The two characters who find each other here are interesting, and are played by charismatic stars; one wishes that the movie lingered longer over their romance.The deaf / gay / interracially coupled son still bears the product labeling from central casting. He and his African American partner are just too bland, too perfect, and too much the tokens to be believed.The tacked-on Hollywood ending ties everything up too neatly. The movie that has gone before this ending says, loud and clear, ""Life is unpredictable and messy. Toss your expectations. Anything can happen at any minute."" And, then, in the final scene, everything is rigid and tucked in.Otherwise, though, ""The Family Stone"" was a lot of fun.",The Family Stone
47,MihaiSorinToma,A good character portrayal,8,8 September 2017,"Meredith, a very polite and well educated business-person but also very odd and quite unpleasant, joins Everett to his family Christmas celebration. She's about to find out that due to her personality, she's going to have a lot of trouble adapting to a loving, open- minded family which she can't understand. Meredith's relationship with Everett is going to be put to the ultimate test before the upcoming proposal.It's an interesting story which doesn't lose any time when it comes to presenting itself. We see Meredith put in the middle of the ""action"" right from the beginning, struggling to make her way into a new family. Meeting and understanding everyone will prove to be a difficult task for her and the ending will be as pleasant as it is unexpected. It manages to be very funny from time to time and it keeps your attention most of the time, moving from one situation to another (thanks to its rather large number of characters). It's enjoyable overall but it had some parts which seemed too exaggerated, out of place, or even too embarrassing for my taste. A good movie to be seen in the winter holidays.",The Family Stone
48,jpschapira,Saving Grace,6,14 January 2006,"I finish watching a movie, and I write. I've got used to it and I like to do it; I don't complain. There are good movies and bad movies, there are boring movies and amusing movies, there are sad movies and happy movies, there are long and short movies, there are documentaries, and there are movies I want to write about and movies I don't want to write about; ""The Family Stone"" easily fits into the latter group.Thomas Bezucha brings his second feature (I haven't seen his first, but if it showed promise, it wasn't worth it; because it is from 2000) from his own handwriting, getting inside the Stones, that could easily be the most liberal and uncaring family brought to life in this decade of cinema. That's not necessarily a bad thing, or at least not for Bezucha, who is free to choose any element that he thinks will make an audience laugh.So his film includes comedy, but it has another darker side and more dramatic, probably frustrating; and another tender romantic side that I particularly found hard to believe, because of the actions of the characters. I also found hard to follow the picture's direction, not in terms of the director's work but in terms of where it wanted to go. There's too much noise, too many characters and too little said.Then I experienced what I experience a lot, but I don't give much importance to because in most of the cases there's no other choice; which is the short time that takes to resolve and change things, mostly when it comes to romance. What happens to me is that I want to believe it's possible (in fact, I do generally), but I can'tI doesn't makes sense to me, ultimately.When Everett (Dermot Mulroney in his comeback years and with an undeniable resemblance to Sly Stallone, even in the way of talking and manners; that I personally think is shown clearly in one frame during the last minutes) and Julie (Claire Danes, she's growing into a fine adult character actress, and her hair still falls as in her younger years' and she looks more beautiful as time goes by) talk at night and then almost get to something (one of those moments), my face went illuminated for the first time in the movie; but I knew it couldn't be.It is in the ending, because it is unavoidable, and unluckily because the trailer reveals the only surprise the movie has for us, and the only element that made me scramble in joy after it occurred, and take the rest of the ride a little less heavily. It was after that moment that I had a few laughs and lightened up about what I did not like.I didn't like the direction (Bezucha's), because it is not confident and it shows diverse images without creating a center, because it doesn't show a sign of concern. Neither does the script that introduces its characters as self-destructive and selfish, that by themselves would be human beings with no morality, if it wouldn't be for the fact that they know they are a family and they love each other for that.The things Bezucha wrote to create some melodrama, I won't tell; the things he wrote to create comedy and I despised, I won't clarify; about the story I won't detail, but I will take a glance at the characters. Take Everett's brother Ben (an excellent Luke Wilson, relaxed and not worried; still able to prove that he is better than his brother at what he does) and the things he does, with total conscience of them and their consequences. When the expected occurs, are we supposed to laugh? Because some people were laughing, but I felt pity.Take Ben's father Kelly (Craig T. Nelson in top form), after he witnesses the occurred. Is that the way he will handle things? And the worst of all (she's not from the family), Julie's sister Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker, who I never liked and has been nominated for her performance here; but I still don't like her) and her racist commentaries, demanding personality and betraying attitude.In other aspects: the highlights. Michael Giacchino's score highlights, with excessive arrangements in those crucial moments where everything is about to explode. The other highlights come from the members of the cast I didn't mention; two actresses. One is an experienced and respected woman, the other one a young and aspiring girl.Diane Keaton is Sybil, the head of the family; and the woman still manages to amaze me and makes me want to clap when she appears on screen. Rachel McAdams (who left Lindsay Lohan unnoticed in ""Mean Girls"" and carried ""The Notebook"") is Amy, the rebellious daughter, beautiful but not aware of it. McAdams is aware of her beauty, and I want to say this because though not many think alike, she is also aware of her talent; and she captures her character's essence, her moving moments and comedic touches with amazing professionalism. I'm glad of her and I hope she continues her way.Many times I said a cast can be the saving grace of a film. At last.",The Family Stone
49,rebeljenn,"boring, scattered",1,24 December 2005,"'The Family Stone' is a film about a family who does not approve of the brother/son wishing to marry a girl he brings home. The film isn't really a comedy - at least, I did not think it was funny if it was. The plot is complex and scattered. The film seems to start out as a film about the acceptance of the young girl into the family. It then takes a full turn around, muddling up what the film seemed to be about at the beginning and just reassessing the fact that the two characters the film was primarily about at the beginning were actually not made for each other. The plot is an unintelligent heap of events with no logical explanation and a poor sense of direction which turns itself around when you're least expecting it. The dialogue between the characters is also as poor as the events, and endless stream of events that wants to copy comedies like 'Meet the Parents'. 'The Family Stone' is a complete escape to somewhere you don't want to be, whether at Christmas or any other time of the year.

The script is wonderful, providing wholly few flaws when that believability factor kicks in, despite the artistic flavor of the dialog. The ensemble cast excels at delivering a wonderful collaboration of wits and fits , hardly leaving for a dull moment. Each family member is brought out to it's rightful fruition, letting any viewer live vicariously through one of it's members with all of the multi-faceted personalities on display. There are a few bumps along the way, but anyone with half of a heart will not be cynical enough to scoff at any minor issues over reaching their boundaries, in what is essentially one of the best ""family"" films of the year.",The Family Stone
51,Superunknovvn,Annoying as hell,5,22 December 2005,"I didn't enjoy ""The Family Stone"", but the movie didn't just leave me cold. No, it actually offended me with its holier than thou morals, the self-righteousness of characters who are supposed to be wise and open-minded, and with its phony dramatic elements.The most irritating thing is that the movie constantly jumps from drama to comedy in completely inappropriate ways. Sarah Jessica Parker's character gets insulted and abused seriously by Family Stone in one scene and in the next everything is back to funny and quirky again. This is to hide that the Stones really aren't nice and liberal people, but the worst bigots you could imagine. And if that doesn't work, you can always give a terminal illness to a character to make him and his loved ones more likable.Of course, that technique doesn't work. The story doesn't move you and a terminal illness doesn't change your mind about characters who have already annoyed you so much earlier. I don't blame the actors for the mess that is ""The Family Stone"". The whole thing suffers from the writer's oversimplified ideas of modern and humanistic thinking. Want a politically correct family? OK, throw in a gay couple, one of them is black, the other one can't speak. They both grin all the time and love children. The parents are totally at peace with their kids' sexuality. In fact, mother Stone loves to joke around about her sons screwing their girlfriends or smoking joints with their father. Those are attempts to make the family seem like good people, but they are just too shallow and forced to make it work.For the most part you just really feel sorry for Sarah Jessica Parker's unsure and anxious character, but you don't know if you're supposed to, because however cruel the Stones get, the movie still tries to sell them as nice people. Somewhere in the middle of the script the writers must have forgotten whose side they were on themselves and had no idea which character should end up with whom, so that the ending would seem happy and placatory to everyone. In the end, they bring characters together that would never fall in love with each other under those circumstances in real life and the whole movie ends up being an illogical and unbelievable chaos.What stays behind is the bitter notion that someone wants to force his values upon you under the disguise of a heartwarming Christmas comedy. And frankly, that's not what I went to the theatre for.",The Family Stone
52,Isaac5855,2005's Most Misunderstood Film....,7,26 January 2007,"THE FAMILY STONE is a well-cast and somewhat moving family drama that got a bad rap due to some inconsistent writing, fuzzy characterizations, and bad marketing. Trying to pass itself off as a warm and fuzzy holiday comedy, this film is really a rather intense look at a fiercely protective family looking out for one of their own as a young businessman brings home his new girlfriend for Christmas to meet his family, who believe this woman is all wrong for him and, therefore, treat her like crap the second she walks in the door. This movie angered me the first time I saw it because I couldn't figure out why the Stones were so mean to Meredith, but upon repeat viewings it became clear that Everett and Meredith were a wrong fit from jump and the family saw this and in their own twisted way are trying to keep Everett from making a tragic mistake. A solid cast has been assembled who, for the most part, help cope with the unpleasantness of this story. Dermot Mulroney, in the best performance of his career, gives a tragic dignity to Elliott who can't understand why his family has turned on the woman he thinks he loves and Sarah Jessica Parker, in a role light years from Carrie Bradshaw, is effective as the tightly wound girlfriend who finds no help in connecting with Everett's family. Diane Keaton's masterful performance as Everett's mom Sybil is fascinating and Craig T. Nelson is charming as Kelly, Everett's dad. Rachel McAdams makes a strong impression as Amy, Everett's sister who is totally nasty to Meredith and Luke Wilson is fun as Ben, the only family member who really makes an attempt to be gracious to Meredith. Claire Danes makes the most of an oddly written role as Meredith's sister, who joins Meredith because Meredith wants her support but, unlike Meredith,is welcomed with open arms and inexplicably, makes Everett forget how he feels about Meredith...one of several plot points that are kind of hard to swallow. Others include why Meredith doesn't offer to sleep on the couch when she won't sleep with Everett in his room or why she incurs Sybil's wrath at the dinner table, making pointed remarks about homosexuality, despite the presence of Sybil's gay, deaf son and his lover or why a woman who is supposed to be this highly intelligent business woman would yell every time she tries to speak to the deaf son. It's also hard to tell whether or not the deaf son reads lips or not. In some scenes it seems like he does and other scenes it seems like he doesn't but he knows when Meredith is yelling. Despite these problems in story, characterization, and continuity, I found this film oddly riveting the second time I watched it and by the fourth time, there were moments that made me cry. THE FAMILY STONE is an emotional family drama for the patient and open-minded.",The Family Stone
53,PersianPlaya408,a good film for the family,8,9 July 2006,"Bezucha's comedy/drama about an uptight woman(Parker) who visits her boyfriend's(Mulrooney) family for the first time on his annual family Christmas vacation and realizes that she is not compatible with the family. Although it had some great comedic scenes, i found Sarah Jessica Parker a bit annoying in this film and at times it was a bit boring and slow. But it had a great third act, and Danes, Keaton, McAdams, Mulroney and Luke Wilson were all great in it. It was a decent and enjoyable film, but i don't recommend repeat viewings. This is one of the better family/ romantic comedies out there. i recommend this one for family functions8/10",The Family Stone
54,DonFishies,"Decent, but could have used a lot more work than it got",6,7 September 2006,"Seeing the trailers, The Family Stone looked like another cute family comedy just in time for the Holidays. I was not to overly hyped about the film, but decided to rent it randomly to give it a shot. And well, to my surprise, it was not another cute family comedy. And that is not necessarily a good thing.The Family Stone is inherently an ensemble film as anyone can tell just my taking a quick glance at the alphabetical cast list. And with all of this talent comes the ungodly notion that everyone needs equal screen time and just enough stake in the plot. So unfortunately for the audience, the film feels like an uneven, subplot filled mess. The key plot line involves Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker), a neurotic and talkative businesswoman, who is going to her boyfriend Everett's (Dermot Mulroney) family home for Christmas.And again, we hit another obvious notion in that the entire family has a quirk, and are all equally dysfunctional. From stoner and deadbeat son Ben (Luke Wilson), to very pregnant daughter Susannah (Elizabeth Reaser), to gay and deaf son Thad (Tyrone Giordano) and his African-American partner Patrick (Brian White), to the oft-spoken father Kelly (Craig T. Nelson) and mother Sybil (Diane Keaton) and daughter Amy (Rachel McAdams), who just seem to hate Meredith for no real reason. And then there's Meredith's sister Julie (Claire Danes), Amy's old flame Brad (Paul Schneider) and Susannah's daughter Elizabeth (Savannah Stehlin).I am fairly confident that I have covered most, if not all, of the characters that pop up multiple times.Dysfunctional family can be done well, as we can all tell by the excellent turnouts for the Indie gem Little Miss Sunshine this summer. But here, it just seems like a convoluted mess of ideas. Writer/Director Thomas Bezucha had his first real crack at the big time here, and he just does not seem to know where he wants the audience to focus their attention. He just has way too much going on at once, and way too much information for the audience to consume all at once. I found myself stopping and rewinding a few times just so I could actually understand what exactly was going on. As a result of this constant jumpiness in focus, no character is really fully developed, and it is almost three quarters in before you finally understand anyone's motivations or just what their part in the film is.Another thing wrong with the film is the fact that it is advertised as a comedy, which is false. This is a drama through and through, with a bit of comedy sprinkled here and there, but not enough for it to fall into being called a dramedy. You can imagine my surprise when I found myself not laughing at all for most of the film, especially after rewatching the trailers used to advertise the film. Again, Bezucha does not seem sure what he wants to do with his film, and as a result, the audience has to suffer through random comedic scenes, and even more random dramatic scenes. And even worse, he adds scenes of total humiliation for Meredith, which just seem way too harsh and unrealistic. The entire conversation about whether or not it is okay for Thad and Patrick to be gay was beyond random, and just felt completely out of place in a film like this.The story and film is decent, albeit predictable, after you get down into the nitty gritty. Although the acting is totally off as a result of the weak script, you can see the actors making it work for them. At times, you can see that the actors are enjoying themselves, and at others, you can see their struggling to make it work. Parker was a completely wrong and ill-advised choice from the start, and her awful performance shows that perfectly. Wilson and McAdams do well with what they have, but players like Nelson, Keaton, Mulroney, Danes and the rest of the supporting crew seem a little worse for the wear. Bezucha throws all of them at us for almost the exact same amount of screen time each, but gives them less and less to use and do each time.What Bezucha should have done was write the screenplay, and then hand the reins over to a more experienced filmmaker. They could have called in a proper polish of the script, and could have given the film a hell of a lot more direction than it has. There is a lot of work that should have been done, and could have been done to fix this film. Whoever greenlit the film and thought Bezucha was alright doing it himself obviously needs to have their head(s) examined.As it stands, it looks and feels more than amateurish, and just does not sit totally right. Like I said, it has its enjoyable moments, but just not enough to warrant it being anything other than below average. Each of these actors have done better performances, and will probably have more coming in the future.6/10.",The Family Stone

The family dynamics work, the awkward laughs come easily (and build), and everyone feels just relatable enough...all signs of a strong set-up and a great cast. But here's the problem: this movie wants to have it both ways. Everything hinges on characters that genuinely feel real...and everything hinges on romantic plot twists that are beyond implausible over a 2-day family gathering. It tries just a little too hard, and doesn't quite work as a result. I still had fun rewatching on Christmas Eve, though. You can enjoy all the great moments, even if the overall story doesn't make it over the hump.",The Family Stone
56,ruby_fff,"There is life after ""SATC"" - Sarah Jessica Parker is alive and well in heart-warming romantic comedy land",8,28 March 2006,"I thoroughly enjoyed w-d Thomas Bezucha's ""The Family Stone"" 2005. Awesome ensemble cast and a funny, entertaining script - not without emotional substantial drama. Bezucha is able to, as in ""Big Eden"" 2000, juggle a good mix of lovable characters and caring storyline with doses of unsuspecting delight. The movie may be at times 'offbeat' (depending on one's viewpoint), yet savory, somehow, at the end of it all. (I like this film much more than ""Rumor Has It"" - another year-end release boasts of a stellar cast with a flimsy plot).The ensemble cast includes steady performance from Diane Keaton as Sybil Stone the 'matriarch' of the family, lively Rachel McAdams as Amy the riotous younger sister to Dermot Mulroney's Everett, who brought home for the holidays fiancée Sarah Jessica Parker's Meredith. There's also Craig T Nelson as the supportive father/pillar of the family, Claire Danes as Meredith's sister Julie supposedly to the rescue, and Luke Wilson as the 'offbeat' brother who has more than an eye on Meredith. Well, the role of Meredith befits Parker to a tee - the nervous energy, the compulsive-obsessive constant state - Parker went to town with it and hesitated not to make a complete fool of herself on screen. She was generous in making fun of herself. The film does remind one of ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" 2001, but Bezucha's story is more down to earth and tangible, celebrating family and holiday traditions with so much heart.The recent ""Failure to Launch"" 2006 playing opposite Matthew McConaughey sure proves that Parker is alive and well after ""SATC"" and has a flair for comedy without limit. I recall what an absolute spirited one she was in Steve Martin's ""L.A. Story"" 1991. (Ah, Martin 2005 - his ""Shopgirl"" novelette became a wonderful showcase of Claire Danes' talent - a blossoming role for her to be the center of attention throughout that film.)",The Family Stone

I was well rewarded with a fast paced script and some fine acting by this cast. I am not a TV nut and I am not familiar with Sara Jessica Parker's acting skills, but I was pleasantly surprised by here versatility. It was as the part was written for her and I look forward to seeing more of her work. This is the story of a close weird family and the problems they survive over a Christmas holiday. If you want to see a movie that will probably not win any statues, but will leave you feeling great, go see The Family Stone, you will enjoy it a lot.",The Family Stone
58,AvidClimber,The Family Stone — Hectic Christmas cheers with a very opinionated family,8,18 February 2013,"The Family Stone is a strangely entertaining Christmas movie. Funny dialogs and situations, some drama, a bit of romance, and you have a good evening.Sarah Jessica Parker is just perfect as this neurotic obsessive control freak who meets the family of her boyfriend for the firs time. You'll love to hate her, you'll laugh at her antics, and pity her for what she's going through. It's not all about her though, we get to know the whole family and spend a very hectic holiday with them.The story is extremely engrossing, and each scene is delight. Lots of discussions, many arguments, and a good number of diverging opinions are the main staples of the scenario. Add to that, heart felt sentiments, some awkwardness, opinionated statements and a touch of tragedy, and you get a pretty satisfying package.The only thing I really have to say something negative about would be the chase scene around the house. A bit over done for adults.I recommend seeing it to those who are looking for nice Christmas film.",The Family Stone
59,tastyhotdogs,Bit weird,6,15 December 2007,"Caught this with wifey Fri night on one of the Foxtel movie channels we're getting for free this month.Going into it, this movie was always going to have a hard time getting me on board. The plot wasn't enticing, the cast was full of B grade actors....not a lot to look forward too. But being the awesome husband I am, some times i know you have to take one for the team.The movie begins with a couple going to the man's family home for Christmas. The couple consist of Everett (Dermot Mulroney, in his most challenging role since Dirty Steve in ""Young Guns"") and Meredith (Sarah Jessica ""Horse Face"" Parker, in her most touching role since Rusty in ""Footloose""), a very sophisticated and serious couple. When they arrive at the home, Everett loosens up a little but poor old Meredith just can't put a foot right. The family is a myriad of past their prime and upcoming actors, including his parents played by Diane Keaton (her most touching role ""Baby Boom"") and Craig T Nelson (in his most intense role since ""Turner & Hooch"") as well as siblings including Luke Wilson and Rachel McAdams. Meredith is about to up and leave when she decides to call on her sister Julie (Claire Danes) to come and offer some support. This only further complicates things though as the family are taken by Julie, most notably Everett. Before we know it we have some partner swapping and things start getting weird.Some interesting scenes and thoughts, but none gone too much into. It touches on death, homosexuality, gay adoption, partner swapping and more. The most fascinating scenes are the gay conversation at the dinner table...extremely confusing and poorly written, and Julie and Everett looking for Meredith.....they don't seem to be looking hard.You could do worse for a chick flick eg ""Monster In Law""......just OK.",The Family Stone

The plot is rear and the acting is superb. Some people can't stand the way the family is and acts or treats Sarah Jessica Parker's character but it's real and that's what's so great. No family is perfect and it shows it but it shows how we act and judge and that's what is so great about it. At times funny and other times a great drama.

A star vehicle? There's no direction, just a random bouncing of the molecules.Compare this to something recent with a similar set up -- wintertime, star appeal, attractive container, similar ambitions -- such as ""Serendipity""...that movie had charm. The plot and narrative was more than merely 'enough'; it was *centered*; there's a big difference. This has no center at all. It's as if the writing sessions themselves were charades; the writer/director simply left in everything, and called it a script.

It is actually 1/3 comedy and 2/3 drama and it works equally well in both genres.I went into the film thinking it was going to be just like ""Meet the Parents"" but instead it was a much deeper, darker, and ultimately more satisfying movie.Sarah Jessica Parker does a tightrope walk in her portrayal of an unlikable person who is nonetheless, sympathetic. Rather than dislike her for her foibles, we feel sorry for her.Rachel McAdams makes every film she is in a better film. Her character is also unlikable because she is so mean, but we are sympathetic towards her because she is defending her family.This film is ultimately about maintaining family values and the importance of having a close knit family and having tolerance for other people's quirks, traditions, and lifestyles. The film conveys it's message in an entertaining way and never seems preachy. It does get sentimental towards the end, but it's a Christmas film, so it's what you would expect.This is a good Christmas film.

63,squirrel_burst,A talented cast in the service of an irritating comedy-drama that fails at being funny.,4,25 December 2014,"I might be in the minority here, but to me, ""The Family Stone"" felt like someone injected ""Meet the Parents"" with a whole lot of cheesy drama and then sucked out all of the funny. It's a confused mess of a movie that doesn't know where it wants to go or what it wants to say. It's the Christmas holiday and the Stone family is gathering to celebrate together. Dian Keaton plays the overbearing mother; Craig T. Nelson plays her more relaxed husband. Luke Wilson plays their stoner son; Elizabeth Reaser plays Susannah, the pregnant daughter; Tyrone Giordano plays the youngest son, who is deaf and gay and lives with his partner Patrick (Brian J. White); Rachel McAdams plays Amy, the youngest sibling. The main characters are Dermot Mulroney as Everett, the straight-laced, kind of boring son that dreams of exploring the world. He is bringing his long time girlfriend, Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker) to the reunion so he can introduce her to the family and ask his mom for the family ring in order to propose. Unfortunately, Meredith is an uptight career woman and not only doesn't she fit in with the family, but they all instantly dislike her. Would-be wackiness ensues among the family drama so Meredith invites her younger sister Claire (Julie Morton) to help her out.This movie doesn't know what it wants to do. It's supposed to be a mix of a comedy and a drama, but despite the talented cast that all give solid performances; it's a dog's breakfast. I found that I didn't like any of the characters, at all. Meredith is the female equivalent of Jason Biggs' character from American Pie in this movie and she proves herself to be so cringe-inducing and so stupid that you end up wanting to dunk your head in a pool of hungry piranha fish just to get away. She constantly says things that are misinterpreted in a way that's downright cartoonish. Her character is so dumb, and so careless with her words that she ends up putting both of her feet in her mouth in a way that's not even believable. If she's a high-powered businesswoman in New York, how come she hasn't learned a thing about handling situations like an adult and can't keep trap shut? I'd go into more details about the other characters, but we've got a lot of material to cover and not all that much time to do so. Let's just say that they range from irrationally bitchy (Amy, mother Sybill) to delightfully bland (pregnant sister Susannah) and none of them are really fun to follow.The irritating thing I found watching the film is that I saw all of these talented people being given a script that feels like the embellished whines of a lonely, middle-aged woman. The film is filled with groan-worthy drama. In another movie it would mean that there's a ton of stuff to look forward to, but here it simply feels bloated. We've got distrust in relationships, the fear of abandonment, the fear of death, sadness at the thought of not being accepted because of one's sexual orientation, regret over missed opportunities, sibling betrayal, anxiety over not being a good enough son, marriage proposals, lost love and we've even got a baby on the way and the chance that Christmas will be ruined. Some of these are hard-hitting issues, so what are they doing in a movie where a woman accidentally puts her car in reverse and crashes it, people get into brawls set to ""The Nutcracker Suite"", people are ruining their outfits by dropping food all over themselves and misunderstandings about who is sleeping with who? Just when the movie was starting to get to me on an emotional level, here comes the unfunny comedy totally out of left field! What we've got here is a comedy-drama where the comedy is never funny, and where the drama is undermined by an avalanche of clichéd developments. This movie even has a scene where a character, having fallen in love, has to chase down the guy/girl of their dreams before they leave town forever. Come on, I thought we were done with that been-there, done-that trope!While I didn't actually like the characters in the movie, I did feel like they were well developed and they felt (for the most part) like real people. Unfortunately, they frequently act in ways that make you question whether or not they've ever been around other human beings. You're telling me that Everett never gave the woman he wants to propose to a brief introduction about what some of his family's beliefs are and yet he choose the annual Christmas get-together to introduce his girlfriend to the entire them? As for Meredith, there's a scene where she ends up in a dire need of a change of clothes... and yet she doesn't ask any of the 4 women staying in the house for a new shirt? Even the little girl in the movie I found to be unbelievable. When you're 10, or however old she is, you're up at 6 in the morning to open up your presents, you're not sitting idly by while the adult's drama plays out. Everyone in this movie has at least one scene that will make you wonder what the writer was thinking when they were developing the characters.The fact that it's a comedy that is never funny should be enough. In this case, ""The Family stone"" is an increasingly irritating Christmas movie with a completely preposterous ending that's supposed to mean who knows what. It also has the gall to have genuinely good moments blended in with clichés you would expect to see in daytime soap operas. I know this movie has its fans out there, so I hope someone can explain to me what they see in this film, because I thought even the title was a lame joke.

64,anhedonia,"Good performances, but unravels a bit too predictably",7,16 December 2005,"Contrary to the marketing campaign, ""The Family Stone"" is not a wild, wacky comedy bursting with laughs. Rather, Thomas Bezucha's movie veers between laughs and drama, some of it serious. And, more often than not, he pulls it off, thanks to some very good performances.The trouble with ""The Family Stone"" is after a rather engaging opening where we're introduced to all the main players, Bezucha trips up. About 40 minutes into the film, he makes it so completely obvious how his story will unwind that there are few surprises, if any. He starts hitting all the points a screen writing guru would demand in some textbook.Nevertheless, the film turned out to be much better than I anticipated. For starters, I went in expecting a raucous comedy about a family and was surprised to see some moving, dramatic moments.But what really make this film crackle, despite its rather pedestrian plotting, are the performances. Especially from Diane Keaton and Craig T. Nelson as the Stone parents and Rachel McAdams as their youngest daughter, Amy.Actually, Nelson and Keaton hold the film together. Keaton has a tough role and she does admirably, never turning her character into a cliché. She finds the right amount of pathos for her role and when she erupts, the outbursts are utterly believable.Nelson does such a marvelous job being the loving father, a subdued performance and quite easily his best. There's real chemistry between him and Keaton. They make a convincing couple. And McAdams is fast-proving why she is turning into one of the hottest actresses in Hollywood. There's real spunk to her Amy, nothing that seems out of place.Yes, the film gets sentimental. But surprisingly, the emotions don't seem unearned for the most part. There are a few obvious touches, but I found myself seeing there was more to like in this film than not.Bezucha should have had the courage to make his story a lot less predictable. The surprises should be just that. But telegraphing them, even in a romantic dramedy such as ""The Family Stone,"" helps neither the film nor the audience.You could do a lot worse than ""The Family Stone.""

65,ikanboy,"Great start, lousy ending.",7,16 October 2007,"For the first 2/3ds of this movie it seemed that I was going to be treated to a serious film about dysfunctional family dynamics. This part of the movie is well scripted, intelligent, unpredictable and edgy. The oldest son (Dermott Mulroney) of a large liberal New England family brings home his girlfriend from the city for Christmas. The girl - played tautly by Sarah Jessicsa Parker - is wound up too tight, humorless, and socially challenged. In short she's just not right for Mulroney, and she's definitely not right for the family, who not only have a Gay deaf son, but one whose partner is black. Yep, all the clichés of liberalism scrunched together in tandem so that we can see how liberal and accepting and loving the family is...NOT! Before Parker's arrival it is made quite clear that this loving liberal family is as prejudicial towards her as Saudis to a gay parade, and based solely on the youngest sister's scathing report of a lunch she had with her and her brother. Bitchiest of all is super mom (Diane Keaton), whose imprimatur is essential for entry into the family sanctorum. They treat Parker as a leper, and she dutifully plunges on committing faux pas after faux pas, until she finally goes too far at the Dinner table, and barrels head on into the tar baby; the gay deaf son and partner, about to adopt. Infuriated by her total lack of discretion the family turns on her and the father (Craig Nelson) angrily sanctions her.At this point in the movie my main interest was in the dynamics of a self righteous family blithely ignorant of it's own colossal arrogance, trying to deal with a self righteous woman blithely ignorant of her own social crassness. Ah, I thought, finally an American movie that is going to explore a family, doing what families do best, showing off the dirty linen to a potential new member, unaware of their own hypocrisies, while preaching down to the virus that threatens to invade it.Then the author loses his nerve completely. It is, after all a Chrsitmas movie, and he then proceeds to make all things nice, by turning the tense satire into farce. I won't bore with the details, but the wicked witch turns into snow white and all the dwarfs grow into Prince Charmings. Leaving me to wonder if the author was really ever aware of what a potential gem of a script he had in the first place, and was simply setting us up for the cliché ridden ending! *************************SPOILER***************************** Jessica Parker and Luke Wilson?

The script is just insane, and not in a good way. I don't know if a different director would've gotten a decent movie out of it, but nothing really works in this effort. Everything is unnatural and cringe-worthy.

Yes... is all of this and more.One good night, i found this movie and i saw it. I believed that it was another silly comedy, like the stupid ""meet the parents"". Well... it was an entire surprise.The story is about a family in Christmas. One of the sons came to the house with his girlfriend. The family doesn't accept her very well. But all of this will change.This is a lovely movie, and is perfect for Christmas. However, is something i hate ... in the story, the son is in love of the sister of his girlfriend, and his brother is in love of the girlfriend of the main character. So typical! But that doesn't impede that the charisma of the movie and of their performances (Diane Keaton is spectacular) they become a great success.Ah!... and of course: Sarah Jessica almost makes me cry.*excuse if i wrote something bad",The Family Stone
69,TheMovieMark,Give Sarah Jessica Parker the Oscar - For Most Overrated Actress,5,3 January 2006,"Who thought it was a good idea to make a movie about Sly and the Family Stone without Sly being involved? It reminds me of the Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers movie that starred the lovely Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sigourney Weaver but with no Tom Petty in sight.*wait for it*Bwahahaha. *wipes tear* I'm too good.""That was lame, Johnny. How long have you been waiting to bust that one out?""All week. But let this be a lesson to you. You see how silly I look? Keep that in mind if you even think about making a similar joke. I overheard somebody say, ""What is this, a movie about Sly and the Family Stone?"" and then he loudly guffawed as if he just read one of my reviews. Anyway, you're probably wondering about the movie, right?Well, it just didn't too much for me. Rachel McAdams and Luke Wilson did a lot for me (hey, keep your minds out of the gutter!), but as for the rest of the movie? Not so much. Why in the wide wide world of sports would anybody make Luke and Rachel secondary characters to Dermot Mulroney and Sarah Jessica Parker? Oh, and all this talk about SJP possibly being considered for an Oscar nomination? Pleeeeeeease. Ms. McAdams acts circles around Ms. I'm Overrated Because I was in Sex and the City.You see, Rachel knows that when you cry in a movie you should actually produce a few tears, whereas SJP's crying consists of her going ""wah hah hah"" and then looking up without a hint of moisture on her face. I just don't understand her appeal. Her acting has never impressed me, and well, I'll just say it - she scares me. When her hair is pulled back she looks *almost* as manly as I do. I know, I know, some of you ladies will probably give me flak over this. I remember offending one young lady once because I compared Kirsten Dunst to Skeletor, but I have to be honest and call 'em like I see 'em.But throwing my absolute indifference for SJP aside, the movie itself misfires on so many levels. I expected this to be a mix of comedy and drama, but I didn't count on it falling so heavily on the dramatic side. Luke and Rachel steal every scene they're in, but whenever they aren't around my interest dropped like Tom Cruise's credibility. I have no doubt there are plenty of moviegoers who will eat up the sappy, melodramatic attempts at warming the heart, but it never felt real to me. Everything is placed too neatly into formulaic boxes.If you have any experience with relational diagrams, then you can plot exactly how this will play out. Here, I'll get you started:Dermot Mulroney - Straight-laced, the most normal of the family. Dating SJP. SJP - Uptight. Doesn't fit in well with the family Stone. Luke Wilson - Free-spirited. Sees something in SJP that the rest of the family ignores. Claire Danes - More attractive sister of SJP. Soon realizes she has a lot in common with Dermot.Would you care to guess who ends up with whom? This is just one of those movies where you will always be one or two steps ahead of it.The film also tries way too hard to show us just how quirky the family is. One of the brothers is deaf and gay. To top all that off he is dating a black man. Woooo, quirky! We get it; they're unconventional - thanks for forcefully shoving it down our throats. Speaking of the gay deaf son, there's a scene at the midpoint that is quite awkward and extremely heavy-handed with Diane Keaton going so far as to say that she actually wished that all her sons would be gay.When Sarah Jessica Parker questions why she would wish that, Diane Keaton and Craig T. Nelson have conniption fits and act as if SJP has just suggested that they should stone the gay deaf son after Christmas dinner. I feel compelled to admit that I felt sorry for SJP's character in this scene. Let me get this straight, if somebody comes up to you and says, ""You know what, I want all my children to be gay,"" you can't then ask why without being labeled homophobic? Hollywood, you just need to calm down with your hypersensitivity.Not a horrible movie, but not a particularly engaging one either. Despite some sporadic laughs, The Family Stone is never as funny as it should be, never as touching as it wants to be, and nowhere near as good as I wanted it to be. But what do you expect when you have people in charge who thought it'd be a good idea for Luke Wilson, Rachel McAdams, and Claire Danes to play second fiddle to lesser talents such as Dermot Mulroney and Sarah Jessica Parker?",The Family Stone

--------------------------The ONLY Tony Kiss Castillo on FaceBook!---The Previews of The Family Stone seemed to hold out the promise of a genuinely light and thoroughly amusing comedy, perhaps a bit over-the-top, but focused on the cultural differences between a very liberal family, (giving the impression that the parents were, perhaps, ""Hippies"" back in the 60's) and a super-conservative and tightly wound woman, engaged to one of their sons.The problem is that the film showcased in the theatrical trailer plus the marketing campaign launched to promote it, vs. The actual movie you see in the theater have absolutely nothing in common! Unfortunately, previews sole raison d'etre apparently is to get people into the theater. It doesn't seem to matter in the least to these people if the expectation generated by the short is totally out of sync with the experience given by the film.Thusly, it is easy to understand the plethora of reviewers who were livid with these bait and switch tactics! At its core, Family Stone is much more of a serious film that attempts to underscore the importance of cohesive family life, and how family unity can overcome obstacles that initially seem insurmountable, such as sharing and then getting over the pain of the loss of one of their own.The cast is remarkable. Sarah Jessica Parker, Luke Wilson, Dermot Mulroney, Claire Danes, Diane Keaton, Rachel McAdams and Craig T. Nelson. Almost all of them renowned actors, who conform a superb ensemble cast. If you enjoy family dramas with a healthy dose of comic relief, Family Stone is far and away better than most films of its kind8******** STARS...,.

Unbelievable storyline that at the same time uses every cliché in the book.Dermot Mulroney brings his uptight corporate girlfriend home to meet his liberal let it all hang out family who immediately act as if he's brought home Hitler personified, which she is plainly not.So while one could understand that SJP's character might not be their favorite cup of tea, it's twice as hard to understand just how vitriolic the family reacts to the SJP character. Makes no sense whatsoever.How would a family supposedly SO understanding and hip be so intolerant of someone invited into their homes unless that character truly were written that way...which SJP's character is not...nor would it make sense that Dermot Mulroney's character would want to date someone like that in the first place.Not only did I not like this movie, I found it irritating and offensive to truly open minded people, much less, informed movie goers.Maybe children who see the world in black & white might like the movie, but for adults, they'll know they're being manipulated in the worst way.",The Family Stone
73,jessie-39,A very nice poignant movie...Amusing and sad.... nice mixture.,7,23 December 2005,"We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that. Sara Jessica Parker and a very good cast are very amusing in this poignant movie. It is not your run of the mill Christmas or romantic comedy movies. It has some really good points of interest. The entire cast including Diane Keaton who is wonderful, Craig T Nelson, Luke Wilson, Rachael McAdams, Dermot Mulroney and the others have great chemistry. Recommend this movie for the entire family.

74,mirwais-orbit,Good till that awful bizarre scene!,2,10 April 2007,"The movie starts well, good story, a complex family, a methodical woman and a guy trying to prove something for his eccentric family. It's something that really happens between a modern family and its gold child's conventional fiancé. Sarah Jessica Parker is brilliant as that successful and methodical woman afraid to meet not only your fathers-in-law but also a dozen of brothers-in-law eager to make her nuts in a point to give up marriage.It's like Meet The Parents for the girls: a lot of drama instead of comedy; Diane Keaton playing Robert De Niro's role; Sarah Jessica as the strange one and a lot of happy endings.The movie goes fine and then something just happen. It's like car tires skidding somewhere in the middle of New York city. That horrible and totally unnecessary bizarre scene where Diane Keaton shows those HUGE pair of breast cancer scars compelling her husband to touch it like saying ""tell me that you still want me and how gorgeous I still look!"" it's just CHOCKING! It's the worst scene I've ever seen in my entire life. There are so many ways to make a touching and tender scene using that intention that I can't help but wonder WHAT is that terrifying scene doing in that kind of movie?From this point to the end you start seeing the worst romance movie in Hollywood history and at the same time the most impossible things to happen no where but Hollywood!

It's depressing and The Stone family are a bunch of a-holes who treat one of the sons fiancée like crap from the moment they meet her. For no apparent reason. Diane Keaton and Rachel McAdams are both b*tch*s.Diane Keaton has breast cancer and is terminally ill. And we're suppose to care, but because of her behavior we could not care less.Merediths so called fiancée won't lift a finger to defend her and protect her from his disgusting dysfunctional family. And when Merediths sister shows up the family all like her but keep treating Meredith like crap. And the fiancée falls in love with the sister and goes after her, like if that is okay. And of course Meredith falls in love with one of the fiancées brothers. This can be seen coming a mile down the road which is bad writing.The movie goes on and on and on for about 30 minutes too long. And the final scene a year later when the sisters have switched partners (yeah because that happens in real life) and the queen witch Keaton is finally dead, could easily have been cut out of the film.And the half deaf gay brother and his black boyfriend are annoying as hell. Especially because they're only there to humiliate Meredith just like the rest of that disgusting family.I'm surprised this was directed by a man.

77,thefan-2,Rachel McAdams is the jewel,5,21 December 2008,"We were chatting the other day about the movie ""Married Life"" and how much we love Rachel McAdams in it, and gradually we realized that we love Rachel McAdams in everything we've ever seen her in. My daughter even went so far as to call McAdams her favorite actress ever. And then we saw her in this embarrassing clunker and it all came back -- she is literally the only good thing in it. And she is very good indeed.The movie, alas, is not so good. It's filled with clichés, farcical, pseudo-emotional. It's a chick-flick-wannabe and it fails even at that. All of which makes McAdams' performance the more amazing, being set, as it has to be, against a cast of hopelessly bad actors trapped in a terrible script. I mean, you know when the pater- and materfamilias are Craig T. Nelson and Diane Keaton (who, naturally, is diagnosed with terminal cancer halfway through) and when one of their children is both deaf and gay (haven't those two minorities suffered enough?), and one of the characters - it doesn't really matter which one - is played by the unwatchable Sarah Jessica Parker - well, then you know you have serious problems.But Rachel McAdams, who is forced to transform from acid-tongued meanie to repentant goodgirl, somehow manages to shrug off the unpleasantness and deliver a performance so convincing, so professional, that it brings tears to your eyes at precisely the moment when the less critical members of the audience are reaching for their third hankies.Merry Christmas, everybody.",The Family Stone
78,bob-rutzel,Disappointing,4,7 May 2006,"The Stone family gets together for a Christmas holiday. Meredith (Parker) is brought to the family affair by Everett Stone (Mulroney) who is going to propose to her. The rest of the Stone family do not like Meredith and she does nothing to help her cause.If this was originally shown during a Christmas time I am sure many were disappointed and hoped that Santa, at least, would put some fun into their lives. Let's face it, there was no story here. This was the Sarah Jessica Parker as Meredith show. Everything centered around her and she did okay with the role except to make it funny as it should have been. The only laughing sound I made had to do with allergies and mushrooms regarding a meal Meredith was preparing. That was it and it was good and spontaneous.Except for that one scene, Parker needed to make her character more comical, but she played everything else too straight and like the Stone Family, I detested her too. I kept asking myself, as I am sure the rest of the Stone family did also, what does Everett see in this woman? She puts her foot into her mouth every time she opens it. And, she is so serious about everything, just not funny-serious. The acting was good, just not funny to keep an audience, and it needed to be funny.Oh, there were some sub plots that could have been given more air time, but this was the Meredith show and we only glimpsed some other problems. One gay son with his gay black friend and they want to adopt a baby; Sybil's (Keaton) terminal illness; daughter Amy (McAdams) who is leading a lonely life; and Ben (Wilson) the Bohemian looking son seeking a direction.Movies that introduce too many characters in a very short period of time in the beginning of the movie, have little chance of being successful. The story jumps around from this and that character too fast and the audience has no choice but to try and keep up, not knowing which character to really focus on and ""what were their names again?""

Fortunatelly I wasn't proved wrong.The fact is that this movie is very well balanced, very well directed and very well acted. Sarah Jessica Parker plays perfectly the role of the uptight and embarrassed bride to be, that meets the family of her fiancé for the very first time. The family doesn't like her as she doesn't exactly fit the profile of their ideal bride.The situations that the female protagonist is called to face are embarrassing and maybe even extreme, yet very realistic. And that is the success of the movie. It is happy, sad and engaging, in a way that feels real.The rest of the cast helps very much in this direction. Especially Dermot Mulroney who gives another excellent performance as the groom to be and the parents played by Craig T. Nelson and Diane Keaton. Craig T. Nelson is phenomenal as the father and Diane Keaton is in one of the most memorable roles of her career.I can't imagine anyone who wouldn't enjoy 'The Family Stone'.

81,tex-42,A Movie Not Sure of What It Wants To Be,5,30 March 2006,"The Family Stone is a messy movie about meeting the family. This movie concerns Everett bringing home Meredith, the woman he wants to marry, to meet his family, the Stones, over Christmas. The Stones are blue blood New England liberals who everyone supposedly loves. However, they decide that Meredith simply is not right for their son/brother and proceed to treat her like dirt. We are not just talking about snubbing, we are talking about full on nastiness. Nothing she does is right, she says all the wrong things, etc. It gets so bad that Meredith calls up her sister to come and join her. Also, there are a number of side plots going on as well. Sybill, the mother, has cancer and apparently not much time left to live. There is also the deaf gay brother in an interracial relationship who is looking to adopt a child. Then there is the pregnant sister who is waiting for her husband to come join them at her parent's house. Next there is the mean-spirited vaguely slutty sister who hates Meredith the most, and the do nothing slacker brother who seemingly has a crush on Meredith. It is at this point that the movie veers wildly off a cliff. Everett proceeds to fall in love with Meredith's sister in about a day. Meredith falls in love with Everett's brother in the same day. It is never explained why it is fine for Meredith to be with the other brother, but not Everett. Then we flash forward a year, Sybill is dead, the baby is adopted and everyone is happy to be together for Christmas.The main problem with this movie is not with the cast, but with the plot itself. There is simply too much going on, and too many cast members. The movie seems to want to be a romantic comedy at some points, but then switches gears and becomes a drama. The characters are not well fleshed out, why give Everett so many siblings if most of them are not given much of anything to do? Essentially this is a movie that is disjointed and sloppily put together. It is okay to sit through, but falls apart if given the slightest scrutiny.",The Family Stone
82,boyinflares,A terrific gem of a film,9,2 June 2006,"""The Family Stone"" is a terrific gem of a film, with a talented cast. At first glance, it may seem like a typical romantic comedy, but it is so much more. It's not entirely a comedy either, as there is a lot of real life style dramas going on with the Stone family and their partners. Interestingly, the majority of the film is set over a very short period of time as well.The premise is simple, Everett Stone (the handsome Dermot Mulroney) is taking his girlfriend Meredith Morton (a surprisingly good Sarah Jessica Parker) to meet his family a Christmas. The only problem is, Meredith is nothing like his family, and even before she arrives she is an outcast, as the family know she is coming along, and Everett's younger sister Amy (the always-amazing Rachel McAdams) has met Meredith once, and it didn't go well, so the Stone's have a bad impression of her. As typical family get together's at Christmas go, this one's not without it's moments, and (almost) everyone gets a chance to shine. It is often the smaller, quiet moments that are sometimes better than the big scenes also. Things progress with Meredith and the Stones', and Meredith's sister Julie (the lovely Claire Danes) arrives to help, only things get more complicated. After several events, Christmas ends with a few changes in store for the Stones.One of the world's best, yet underrated actresses, Diane Keaton, plays the eccentric Stone family Matriarch, Sybil, and as usual, Keaton gives a very fantastic performance. Craig T. Nelson doesn't get a lot to do as her husband, Kelly, but is very good nonetheless. Luke Wilson plays brother Ben who finds his life changed in a major way by the arrival of Meredith, Elizabeth Reaser (one of my new favourite actresses) is so underused in this film and doesn't get a lot to do, but she is so amazing as sister Susannah. Tyron Giordano is terrific as brother Thad who happens to be deaf and gay. Brian J. White plays his boyfriend Patrick. Big applause to the writers / producers etc and the actors for having 2 normal gay characters in a mainstream film that are not simply there for comic effect or to get the audience's sympathy. An interesting debate is also raised around the dinner table about homosexuality, again something brave in a mainstream film.Overall, a fantastic film that almost anyone should be able to enjoy, you're bound to find at least one member of the Stone's who you can relate to in some way or another.",The Family Stone
83,JankiSharma,Ordinary and pleasant,8,26 December 2005,"This movie is all about a family. It's about parents and 3 brothers and 2 sisters. It's about parents who cherish their children irrespective of their flaws. Irrespective of their personalities. Irrespective of who they bring home as their life partners. A couple of scenes will stay in my mind for a long time. The one at the table where the discussion is centered on gays. Dianne Keaton and Craig Nelson as the parents of a gay son did an extraordinary job at displaying emotions. Another favorite scene of mine is when Rachel McAdams is sleeping on the couch next to her sister who is watching television and Craig Nelson remarks that he likes her sleeping like that. No nastiness. No rude remarks. No arguments please. Like a typical father. Another scene is when everyone in the family gets a beautiful Christmas gift from Sarah Jessica Parker. Their reaction is very touching.Claire Danes is truly the stage beauty. She looked confused and uncomfortable when she was asked to try on her sister's ring. Sarah Jessica Parker , the uptight sister, too uptight for the Stone family, was jealous when her sister Danes was liked more than her by the Stones. I was never a fan of Luke Wilson especially after Alex and Emma. But he was tolerable in this movie as the brother who was drooling over his brother's girlfriend. Dianne Keaton should be given Oscars every time she signs a movie. She is extremely talented and is very good in this movie.Rachel McAdams was good in The mean girls, The Notebook and now this movie.

Every possible cliché about racial, ethnic, cultural, and social classification that define difference as normative, status quo, or conformity is added in this story as if there was a check list of issues the screenwriter wanted to be sure and include like a recipe being followed. Thrown together is a dash of: gay, deaf, African-American, WASP, liberal,conservative, yuppie, upper-middle class, incest, bed-hopping, cancer stricken, nature/nurture, brothers,sisters, boyfriends, husbands, wives, grandchildren, expectant mother, ma (Diane Keaton) and pa (Craig T.

Into this situation is added the uptight girlfriend, Meridith (Sarah Jessica Parker), of the eldest brother(Dermott Mulroney) who is so repressed that she can not spend the night with him under his parent's roof. So open-minded is the ASL signing Stone's who have no problem with a deaf gay son and his black lover who are awaiting to adopt an infant, but can't find patience or tolerance for girlfriend, a suit-wearing professional who won't stop talking and incessantly clears her throat while she barges into the family dynamic. Is this the new American nuclear family?When Keaton reneges on her promise to turn over her mother's wedding ring to son,Mulroney, he sulks off to his bedroom, sans the ring and his almost fiancée. She's busy slugging back shots with middle brother, Luke Wilson at the local bar. Mellow brother is a pot smoker who sees the real ""freak"" in Meridith and wants to unleash it. Add to the confusion is the detour of a friendly walk Mulroney took with Meridith's easy going younger sister, Claire Danes, who is more his cup of tea and the film becomes changing partners for the night.This is a terrible screen play that has several big name stars whose presence is meant to give credibility to the inane script, and thus funding by a studio. Shame on Diane Keaton, Craig T. Nelson, Dermott Mulroney, Clare Danes, Luke Wilson, and Rachael McAdams who are all made fools by the film that should have been shelved as an insult to intelligence.

Don't' tell me how boring it would be if we were all the same! I cannot believe how rude the family Stone were to this poor nervous idiotic girl from the big city. Mother in particular, was keen to put the boot in, describing her as ""that woman"" who will inherit the family heirloom wedding ring if she marries the presumably eldest son, who is not a huge catch anyway, any more than the ring - totally devoid of loyalty to the girl whom he has just hurled into a viper's nest, and eager to get on over-friendly terms with her sister, who also seems to lack concern over her sibling's distress. Hold on there- this must run in the family, because the scruffy brother, who IS concerned about her welfare takes her out, gets her drunk off her face, and obviously ends up married to her (without the ring). I kept waiting for the funny bits - comedy to me implies laughter - but I was squirming with embarrassment for poor Meredith or raging against the family for most of the film. Disbelief was the strongest emotion.Anyway, it all ends up happily - mum dies, so everyone is nice to each other and dad found a tree for the next Christmas. Families, eh?",The Family Stone

Even Rachel McAdams who I love is such a pain in the @ss in this movie, and I guess she is supposed to be. But after 40 minutes I can't stand to listen to another argument amongst the dysfunctional family.When Everett (Mulroney, which by the way is my name ""Everett"") takes his over talking, uptight girl friend Meredith (Parker, in a very bland role) to meet his family for Christmas. His parents (Keaton and Nelson), his annoying sister (McAdams) and his stoner numb-skull brother (Wilson). But the meeting of the two does not go according to plan when the family offends Meredith and leads to some over done and almost rushed dialogue. The last act just doesn't fill in and it seems the characters are taking these drastic moves in relationships over the course of say 3 days. We really don't get to know them but before we do they change non-stop. First they are nice, then yelling then crying it's just way too much and Bezucha has no control over this screenplay.

87,samseescinema,a stand-out addition to the ever-lengthening list of Christmas films,8,18 December 2005,"The Family Stone reviewed by Sam Osborn rating: 3 out of 4 With Christmas comes Christmas movies; and, for the most part, these annual outings are typical holiday duds. So imagine my surprise with The Family Stone. It's a Christmas film with scope beyond raucous family gags. It bothers itself with honest and sobering realities of family, deciding not to solely rely on tickling our funny bones, but delving into why Christmas is, at its heart, about coming together.That's not to say The Family Stone is devoid of on-rails formula. The most obvious of these formula traits is the film's premise. Everett Stone (Dermot Mulroney) is bringing his new girlfriend, Meredith Morton (Sarah Jessica Parker), to meet his family for the holidays. Of course, we all know what's gonna happen: mass hysteria between family and newcomer, mounting to climactic relationship issues, and a resolution spent around the Christmas tree with long-lasting family ties. It's a well-trodden formula; but as with any formula, the heart must lie in its characters. Writer/Director Thomas Bezucha understands this, and has written his characters to work as a dimensional family. The Stone family is deliciously convincing. But they aren't written as another kooky family for our ""normal"" protagonist to get tangled up with. In all reality, with The Family Stone, Meredith is the kooky character. She's justifiably strange. But this dynamic of realistic family life is truly what gives The Family Stone its heart. We can see the deep, turning cogs of the Stone family and let ourselves fall into their warm, infectious banter.It doesn't hurt that Bezucha assembled a forceful cast for The Family Stone. With Claire Danes, Sarah Jessica Parker, Diane Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Dermot Mulroney, Craig T. Nelson, and Luck Wilson, Bezucha's only worry should have been giving each of these actors their chance to shine. Luckily, his script allows for development with each player, again allowing his film to take a deeper look into family inner-workings. But this also makes it hard to single out any of the supporting performances. They're actually all quite impressive. Keaton again improves upon her comeback, following up 2003's hit Something's Gotta Give. Nelson reprises his endearing father role from The Incredibles, this time donning the peaceful professor persona instead of spandex superhero fittings. Luke Wilson, Rachel McAdams and Claire Danes all pull in equal amounts of holiday cheer as well. The stand-out, however, is Sarah Jessica Parker. Most T.V. superstars stumble when breaking into film because they're cast as essentially the same character they played in their previous T.V. spot. Jennifer Aniston has repeatedly run into this dilemma, reprising the tired, easy smile of Rachel from ""Friends"". But Parker's Meredith Morton is certainly different from her Carrie Bradshaw of ""Sex and the City"". Meredith is uptight, business-oriented, and completely unprepared for the frantically mellow atmosphere of Everett's large family. Her contradictions to his world are palpable. When I read through the Golden Globe nominations, I was at first shocked by her inclusion in the Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy noms; but after seeing her Meredith Morton, I realize the Hollywood Foreign Press was completely justified in their decision.The Family Stone is a stand-out addition to the ever-lengthening list of Christmas films. Its script is smart enough to allow the pace to slow, and take a break to indulge with family realities. Without giving away too much, The Family Stone knows that giggles and blushes aren't the only emotions of the holidays. It knows mortality and pain, and deals with them humbly, not wishing to flaunt them with melodrama. And although the family's romances often lend themselves to idealisms and sentimentality, the characters have heart enough for us to mostly look past these and truly enjoy the family.",The Family Stone
88,marissas75,Talented actors have fun with a familiar premise,7,17 March 2006,"The premise of ""The Family Stone"" sounds a little shopworn: Everett Stone brings his uptight girlfriend Meredith home for Christmas to meet his large family, who instantly dislike her. Even worse, the trailer reveals most of the plot's complications. However, this premise has been used so often because it reliably provides opportunities for comedy, drama, and insight into family dynamics. ""The Family Stone"" proves itself a better-than-average example of the genre because of its talented cast and reasonably intelligent script.Sarah Jessica Parker's presence ensures that Meredith always remains sympathetic, even when we can also perfectly understand why she irritates the Stones. The various Stones-- Diane Keaton, Craig T. Nelson, Dermot Mulroney, Rachel McAdams, Luke Wilson--make the most of their roles, and, more importantly, they really do start to seem like a family, not a random collection of actors. The only actor who fails to make an impression is Claire Danes, who can't do much with the underwritten role of Meredith's sister Julie.""The Family Stone"" is not a groundbreaking movie, but it goes beyond the fish-out-of-water clichés that its plot might suggest. It finds the emotional truth, as well as the humor, in Meredith's situation. Plus, it's extremely evenhanded: all of the characters are flawed but likable, and in a climactic argument at the dinner table, both Meredith and Sibyl make valid points. Reviewers on this site have accused the movie of pushing a liberal agenda via its sympathetic portrayal of an interracial gay couple and a semi-bohemian family--and of pushing a conservative agenda via its portrayal of the Stones as hypocritical liberals who pay lip service to tolerance but are prejudiced against people like Meredith. Personally, I'm not sure if ""The Family Stone"" has any agenda, other than to cast good actors in a holiday comedy-drama that doesn't insult its audience's intelligence. And it succeeds pretty well at that.",The Family Stone

Each relationship on its own could have been more interesting if more time could have been spent with each but that would have required at least twice the time allowed. Each character was interesting but the hope of involved relationships was lost when we were forced to move on to someone else's. I don't want to get started on a relationship and then put it off until later just so I can be exposed to someone else's story.Good: Characters, off and on emotional moments and individual acting.Bad: Scene merging, character timing and/or inter-relations, directing",The Family Stone

91,leilapostgrad,Austin Movie Show review -- perfect X-mas movie for Grown-Ups,9,18 December 2005,"Finally, a Christmas movie for adults! (And no, I don't mean porn.) The  Family Stone is about adult children coming home with their significant  others (whether new or old) to spend Christmas with their parents and  siblings. The Stones are a cool, casual, progressive, and close family.  When oldest brother Everett (Dermot Mulroney) brings home his uptight,  superficial, high-strung, pretentious-but-insecure girlfriend Meredith  (Sarah Jessica Parker), the family does not approve of her, and they  let her know it.  Up until this point, it's all laughs and giggles, but when we learn  that Everett's mother Sybil (Diane Keaton) has breast cancer, serious  laughing turns into serious crying. But the best thing about The Family  Stone is its perfect balance of comedy and drama, because life is  equally funny and painful.  The most awkward, embarrassing, and hilarious scene is at the dinner  table on Christmas Eve, when Everett's gay and deaf brother Thad  (Tyrone Giordano) talks about adopting a baby with his life partner  Patrick (Brian J. White). Meredith asks the men if they're worried  about the baby growing up to be gay. When Sybil tries to make a joke  out of it by saying that she wished all of her children would've been  gay, Meredith royally sticks her foot in her mouth by saying, ""You  didn't actually hope for gay children, did you? I mean, you wouldn't  want to make life any more difficult for the child, would you? I mean,  knowing what kind of life they're going to have."" Wow  let that be a  lesson of what NOT to say at your future in-law's dinner table.  This is the Christmas movie I'll want to watch every year. I've grown  out of Frosty the Snowman, and I don't think I could handle another 24  hours of A Christmas Story on TNT. By the time you're in your twenties,  Christmas is far from magic. It's really just about surviving our  family's insanity, and that's exactly what The Family Stone is about.",The Family Stone

And trust me, even before the end credits roll across the screen - ""Niagara Falls!""I mean, come on here folks, The Family Stone is a holiday film built like a armored Battleship but easily makes swift turns like a sleek PT Boat.

This is truly a ""all hands on deck"" classic holiday endeavor.So what's not to like about this holiday themed film? To be completely, brutally honest: Nothing! It's all good. No kidding. The Family Stone consciously looks like a straight forward comedy, and it succeeds. Yet, it's also a heart breaking drama. And I must say the two themes compliment each other quite nicely.No spoilers here, as always, but I will reveal that there is a running gag about one of the characters where the more they try to ""fit in"" the deeper they dig themselves into a hole. The sensitive screenplay by director Thomas Bezucha establishes several subplots around one central fact: ""There's nothing like spending the holidays with your family. And for better or worse, in the end, family is all that really matters.""",The Family Stone
93,Movieguy_blogs_com,This is one of the few films I have seen where the ending really makes up for the poor beginning.,6,17 December 2005,"In 'The Family Stone' Sarah Jessica Parker plays Meredith Morton, a well-mannered yet uptight woman who is meeting her fiancé's, Everett Stone (Dermot Mulroney), parents for the first time during Christmas. Everett's family is a little more liberal than what Meredith is used to and do not exactly welcome her with open arms. She thinks everyone hates her, so she calls her sister, Julie (Claire Danes), to come down and her with this emotional crisis.This move starts out really lame. Meredith might be a little odd, but is now way a bad person. Yet almost everyone in the family seems to gang up on her. Right when the Stones are about to accept her, something else has to happen that ruins it. However, as the movie progresses, it actually gets a lot better. It becomes a heart-warming tale that brings everyone together. It is funny how fate has a tendency to do that.This is one of the few films I have seen where the ending really makes up for the poor beginning.

94,twilliams76,"Family, holidays and outsiders ...",7,13 July 2011,"The Family Stone is actually one of the rare Hollywood ""family goes home for the holidays"" films that merits respect, appreciation and admiration. We seem to get these films every year ... and they always tend to be the same film with different titles.In Stone, Dermot Mulroney's Everett Stone (My Best Friend's Wedding, J. Edgar, About Schmidt) brings his tightly-wound fiancée, Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker - Sex and the City, Footloose, Ed Wood), home to meet his liberal family for the holidays.The ""stone"" of the title is the family's last name; but is also the engagement band Everett is expected to ask his mother for over the holiday. As Meredith is uptight and NOT the best communicator (see her treatment of Everett's gay, deaf brother with a black boyfriend played by Ty Giordano -- The Next Three Days, All About Steve, Untraceable), she doesn't get along or fit in with the Stone family after she makes mistake after mistake after mistake ""trying"" to be nice to them (ahem ... the ""trying"" part is the problem -- JUST be nice!!) -- which helps with the family-side of the argument: ""No ring for her!"".Diane Keaton (Father of the Bride, The Godfather, The First Wives Club) and Craig T. Nelson (The Incredibles, Poltergeist, The Proposal) play the parents -- him more mellow and her more high-strung with her own burdens/secrets to bear -- while fellow siblings Luke Wilson (Old School, Legally Blonde, Charlie's Angels) and Rachel McAdams (Sherlock Holmes, Mean Girls, The Notebook) try to make the best of the situation -- him by playing nice and her by allowing Meredith to self-destruct. To throw a wrench into the relationships/dynamics of the film, Meredith's sister (Claire Danes - Little Women, Romeo + Juliet, The Hours) is brought in to help diffuse the situation (a little too late).This isn't the typical dysfunctional family film because this family isn't dysfunctional at all ... they mesh and it is the outsiders who are telling them how to live that creates most of the problems. The film has its bits of comedy and it is also surprisingly touching as its dramatic elements add considerable heft to the story's proceedings.It is nice seeing Parker play dramatic again and it was a relief to see Keaton toned-down and less manic. Believable family on film is very hard to depict on screen; but The Family Stone does it here (the only other film this convincing in recent years is the Steve Carell film, Dan in Real Life).This is a good holiday film; this is a good family film ... this is a good film, period.",The Family Stone
95,cwrdlylyn,"THE FAMILY STONE : Good, But Not As Fun As You'd Think...",6,15 January 2006,"THE FAMILY STONEIf you go into this movie expecting a good time, harmless laugh... you're sadly mistaken. Though it's a little too long and unbalanced, at times THE FAMILY STONE is a bittersweet, funny, endearing, and in many ways terribly sad movie. Trailers for this film were incredibly misleading in portraying the film as a lightweight fish out of water story, but THE FAMILY STONE has more meat on it's bones.The story sets in motion when Meredith Morton (Sarah Jessica Parker) joins her boyfriend Everett Stone (Dermot Mulroney) to spend the Christmas Holiday with his family. Immediately upon arrival, the uptight Meredith is battered to pieces by the liberal Stone family... and she must suffer the incredibly smug and rude attitudes that radiate from the mother (Diane Keaton) and youngest daughter (Rachel McAdams).Firstly, Keaton and McAdams play insufferably smug and self-satisfied women in this movie. It was disappointing for me to see how truly unlikeable these characters can be. However, their motivation is that they just don't think Meredith is the right match for Everett... and they'll stop at nothing to let him now.Adding fuel to the fire, Keaton's character Sybil is dying of breast cancer. Little by little the family comes to realize this and they must cope with this tragedy while they balance the joy of their last holiday together and the mess that has been created with Meredith's introduction.Sybil's disease is a center-point of the film... and it's truly a depressing story. Through the cattiness of the Stone women, we also see a fierce bond shared by every member of the Stone clan. They are unlikeable to the outsider, but amongst themselves their love is so incredibly apparent. And to watch a family that truly loves their mother suffer to cope with her death is incredibly difficult to blend into a comedy.In regards to what the film pretends to be in commercials, the film does not work. But when looked at without any previous perceptions... it is a strong, but flawed piece. THE FAMILY STONE managed to get some real emotional reactions out of me, and certain elements of it are constructed very well. The ensemble works brilliantly together and the performances of Keaton and Nelson (as the father) were spot on.Overall, I didn't like that the movie seems to lie about itself in previews... but aside from that, it kept me interested and had me caring about the characters. So despite it's poorly balanced comedic/drama line... I still thought it was a decent film overall.... C+ ...",The Family Stone
96,rogerdob,Totally forced comedy ( or is it a drama?),2,24 December 2005,"I was hoping to see a heartwarming and satisfying Christmas Film. However, what I got was a totally forced comedy that left me wanting my money back. All the comic and dramatic situations in this film were forced to happen by creating unlikely and unbelievable set-ups. The most awkward situation was the couple who was not only hearing impaired but also gay AND interracial. This relationship was there so the director could make a BIG POINT later in the film. The only time I felt anytime type of emotion was when they showed a clip from ""Meet me in St. Louis."" I longed for the days of truly well-made Crhistmas films.And please, can Diane Keaton play any character other than Diane Keaton",The Family Stone
97,jax713,Stone cold,1,10 July 2006,"A bad script brought to a simmer by very good acting does not a good movie make. The events and interactions of the characters are beyond comprehension in this story which shifts continually between comedy, tragedy, and keystone cops pratfalls. It's difficult to imagine being able to find a group of people this rude, this conniving, and this judgmental who would treat a guest so badly while presenting a facade of family. Keaton's character is the only one who has a reason to behave badly while most of the rest are so caricatured as to render them nearly unwatchable. This movie tries way too hard to pack in every emotion in the dictionary by offering up new plot lines every 5 minutes and in doing so practically suffocates you with its tick list of social, moral, political, familial, and sexual commentaries. It's a movie so in love with itself that it essentially leaves the audience behind to fend for itself. It looks like the director/writer thought this would be his only film ever and he had to get in every possible storyline. A remarkable cast is the only saving grace, all of whom deliver a collectively strong screen presence no matter what they are called on to do. I'm surprised they didn't all just pass out from dizziness, twirling this way and then that way, then this way again. Sarah Jessica Parker deserves special mention for doing a particularly outstanding job with a character in a constant state of humiliation. Like me, she must have had a stomach ache by the end of the film.",The Family Stone

One was the shameless use of Keaton's impending demise, especially the stupid sick scene when she made her husband touch her excised breast, and the other was the supposed-major-catalyst scene at dinner when Parker ranted and raved like a lunatic redneck about gays. This was completely out of character for her. But, for that matter, so was the over-scripted supposed hatred of Parker by all the children in the family. They were all extremely loving and nice people and so they followed the script but the script did not match their character. It was just too-feel-good at the end to be true.

Lovely Ensemble playing all round: this film is slightly predictable, but with the chemistry between Claire Danes, Dermot Mulnroney, Sarah Jessica Parker and Luke Wilson, who's carping? There are some fine moments of acting: there is a scene around a dinner table. All the cast are good, although Diane Keeton, Craig T.

Their family is all about accepting everyone for who they are and making them fell like they belong. I think everyone in one time or another has experienced bringing a girlfriend or boyfriend to meet the family and see if they approve or not.As Meredith try's to become part of the family, everyone has thought it difficult because no one can comprehend or figure out really why Everett is with her. Some people don't know who they are or what they are interested in, particularly being in a relationship. The family judges Meredith without even giving her a chance and Meredith is forced to call her sister Julie (Claire Danes) to make herself feel not so alone. Your parents help you out throughout life and expect you to have everything you want out of life, but most important accomplish more or have a better life than they saw theirs.

101,mike-925,Too Sly A Family Stone For Some Tastes,7,2 January 2006,"Family Stone opens with a forty-something couple arriving at the young man's family home for Christmas. The woman is Meredith Morton, the man Everett Stone.Diane Keaton is the Mother Sybil, Craig T. Nelson is Kelly Stone her husband. Owen Wilson's brother Luke is Ben Stone, the hippie Berkeley student. There are five Stone children altogether, one of them married and pregnant, and her mean sister Amy is played by Rachel McAdams.The Family is waspish looking, their house a Victorian. They live in an unnamed New England State. But if they're wasps, their attitudes aren't very conservative. There is a partially deaf gay son home with his black live-in partner. The two are trying to adopt a child. The cruel sister Amy carries a handbag with NPR stamped on it. Waspish or not, they're stereotypically liberal. Still not convinced? Father Kelly Stone and his hippie son Ben go out and smoke a bowl of gage in a nearby ballpark. Mrs. Stone tells the uptight, astounded Meredith that daughter Amy ""lost her cherry"" to a local high school kid in her teens.So what does that make the awkward intruder Meredith with her pulled- back-into-a-bun, dark brown hair and her business-like, uptight black skirt?Frankly, Meredith strikes me as Jewish conservative. She's a stereotypical professional business woman, who helps Everett (Dermot Mulroney) solve an investment banking problem in the big city. Parker is Jewish in real life and she plays the part Jewish though it is never stated that she is Jewish in the film. Its as if Phillip Roth's Goodbye Columbus has been turned on its head. Instead of the outsider coming to criticize the Scarsdale family of the rich Jewish American Princess, the Stone family has turned the tables and will criticize the awkward very Jewish Parker when she enters their realm.Meredith gets in trouble right away by being too businesslike when the family is so obviously laid back and relaxed, though they are overly caustic and critical. They're trying to kid her but she's not taking it well. Her ""otherness"" is disturbing this mainstream family.So they pounce on her. She reacts, moves to a nearby ""inn"" and finally, in desperation, calls her sister Julie Morton (Clair Danes) to come help her against this vicious family. Meanwhile, the entire clan has privately concluded Meredith is wrong for Everett. The instant this judgment is made we know Everett will now fall for Julie Morton instead. Meanwhile, the audience has been cued that Ben likes Meredith, so we know where that plot device will lead also. Everything is resolved already, right? We're only a quarter of the way through the movie. Actually, everything isn't resolved. Cruel Amy doesn't have a current beau and we haven't brought Meredith around to liking let alone loving Everett. We need a series of slapdash events and some thirties Hal Roach hokum to get this movie moving. Meredith makes a breakfast entrée and Everett tries to get his mother Sybil's heirloom wedding ring for Meredith, then slips an engagement ring on Julie's finger instead and it won't come off without soap. What a time for an audience in bed with husband Kelly to find out Mrs. Stone has already had both breasts removed while an earlier husbandly hint that she may die is slowly confirmed to the rest of the family. Meredith has also managed to wreck her rental car in the Stone front yard.Clair Danes has scored big in many movies in recent years. She saved the Hours and I read she is great in Steve Martin's Shopgirl. Though she clearly has the least to do of anyone in this ensemble film, her part as the sister is the best in the movie and she nearly runs away with it all. But not quite. She simply does not have enough to do to steal this movie. Luke Wilson's Ben Stone is the best acting I've ever seen him do. Perhaps the problem has been that Wilson has usually written his own part for a screenplay that he has also directed. Freed of all that here, Luke Wilson has finally gotten a chance to act.I don't like the cliché family stuff, and I dislike the obvious 'funny stuff' which is funny like the alleged laughs in romantic comedies that are not funny. The Family Stone is a serious family drama with an overlay of romantic comedy to sell this vehicle to an audience in the mood to be entertained. Without the overlay, it resembles too closely a stiff TV drama I once saw, set in a typical American home at Christmas with a dying Ed Asner playing the father. There are casting problems. Dermot Mulroney is getting too old to continue playing eligible young bachelors. He's 43. Parker is 40. Casting people this old as young couples seems like throwing a bone to a boomer audience unwilling to admit its age.Finally though, the story passed the one test most important to a movie: The script contains enough surprises to keep the audience in the dark about most of what is to happen next. If you don't see many films these days, you'd be surprised how few movies manage this.",The Family Stone

They just took one look at her and decided she was no good. I felt had they developed this part of the story better the movie would have made more sense. So she's uptight. She was clearly trying very hard to be respectful of them, ie; sleeping in a separate bedroom, brining them all gifts....and they treated her atrociously. I felt they were extremely immature and rude, and even though she made some off color comments she was put on the defense from the very beginning. It was painful to watch. I felt very sorry for her. I didn't think it was funny. I thought it was cruel. I don't feel it was ever made clear why this family acted this way and why they disliked her before even meeting her.There were jokes throughout, but I never laughed once.

The characters lack even the remotest resemblance to real people. The setting is derivative and banal. Quite what Diane Keaton was doing in this farrago I can't imagine.

Nevertheless if you just want to be entertained by a predictable, happy/sad, multiple romantic comedy/farce, enjoy this film.What is best is Rachael McAdams who in recent films has shown a tremendous range. Least used talent was a waste of Claire Danes considerable abilities in a ridiculously truncated romantic interlude. I personally prefer Sarah Jessica as a blonde with a little more weight. I don't think I will ever be able to see her as anybody but Carrie Bradshaw.Merry Christmas!",The Family Stone
111,RobinCook70,The No-Hope Family,1,5 May 2006,"The casting was great, but the family-meet-the-potential-newbie-member and let's-toss-in-some-snow-and-a-Christmas-tree DOES rankle the chain, especially when brothers and sisters swap future mates under the family roof ... uh, did I say ""family?"" With this in mind, I now feel better that Sarah Jessica Parker's character insisted on staying in a separate bedroom than her future husband's family home and subsequently went to a motel. She should have left town.I think the main reason for me that this movie was so awful is that every character in this movie was so dreadfully and disgustingly dysfunctional and the film offered me nothing to hope for with no chance whatsoever to even like ANY of the characters. Some attempt was made to give emotion or a glimpse of insight, but those attempts were very shallow and yanked away like a soiled tablecloth. If the intended thrust of the movie was to totally dislike having a family, then it fully succeeded. Parker's acting was very well done ... perhaps too well done. At times it appeared that her acting was so well done that the other cast members couldn't deliver their lines ... as if they wanted off the set asap. As a result, it seemed everyone was forcing themselves to deliver their lines so they could leave this movie quickly.If the sibling mate swapping had been left out, this movie could have worked out better. There was no credible romance or passion ... lust or love ... involved as well. The mere thought of more dysfunctionals getting together with other dysfunctionals made my entire body cringe at the mere thought of saying to myself, ""Omigod, they'll make dysfunctional babies too!"" Summarily, if you are a ""hopeful family type"" of personality like me, then I recommend not watching this movie.",The Family Stone

The entire family are awful nasty people, PC nutters with righteous morals, the worst kind. The mother is awful.Original review belowIf you can get past the politically righteous moral high ground, it's a touching film. I don't know what they are trying to portray.If you cannot listen to all sides of a point of view, no matter how crazy and how ridiculous, in a open way, then you get this. If nothing else, leave it out of a Christmas film.Simply put, if they had just focused on how families deal with Christmas, left all the other, better than thou bull, it could have been good.Cheap, could have been classic.",The Family Stone
113,eXtreme23,A good surprise of a movie,7,4 June 2006,"The Family Stone is a story about an annual gathering of a New England family. Before the holidays are done, relationships will unravel while new ones are formed, secrets will be revealed and the Stone family will come together through its capacity for love. This movie had some great characters. Sarah Jessica Parker,Rachael McAdams, Luke Wilson, Claire Danes, Dermot Mulroney and Diane Keaton. Each of them have their own story in this movie and this is what I really like about it. This family gathers around every year just in time for the holidays. Everett (Mulroney) is bringing his girlfriend Meredith (Parker) to his parents' house and he wants the rest of his family to meet her. The only person who really knows about her is Amy played by the upcoming star, Rachael McAdams. Amy doesn't like anything about Meredith, she always complains about everything she does. Meredith does feel nervous about meeting everyone but from the very start, she knew that no one liked her. She would so many embarrassing things that would make the family hate her even more.I really like Rachael Mcadams, she's my favorite character in this movie. After seeing her in the thriller, ""Red Eye"" I knew that she will be getting better roles and doing better movies. I really liked her in this movie and I know that she will have a wonderful future.I don't know why but this family reminded me of my uncles and aunts for some reason, I'm not sure. But this movie isn't really laugh out loud, it may make you snicker or laugh but not out loud. I just liked this movie for how it is. It has a special meaning to it and the ending made me like the movie even more.I did like this movie. It's funny, has some drama and has a good story. So if there isn't a good movie for you to watch or rent, this maybe a good choice. If I had to give it a score out 10, then I would give it a 7.5 out of 10.",The Family Stone

These bohemians live in a big house and drive Volvos. How did the dad afford all this as a college professor?! Must be some fancy New England Ivy League school.Anyway, she goes and doesn't fit in as all the forced characters show up, including--get this--a gay, deaf son with a black boyfriend. Come on, writers. Switch to decaf! And then there's the catty back-and-forth with the younger sister, who zzzzzzzzz....Sorry. I dozed off.

115,creator301,Weird reviews here.,1,21 December 2020,So on one end you have great reviews by mostly middle aged women and then you have more middle aged women reviewing poorly because the family was mean to SJP. Her character sucked and you were supposed to hate her so I completely disagree. That doesnt mean the movie was any good though. Random 2000s chick flic crap. Unbelievable at every turn and after about halfway someone is crying hard about every two minutes and they just give up on even trying to tell a story.,The Family Stone
116,rddj05,Solid Performances Can't Save This Film,3,3 August 2007,"The Family Stone is one of those films that you imagine attracted an all-star cast because it looked much better on paper, than it would eventually look on film. It's first problem is that it doesn't know what it wants to be. It is certainly not funny enough to be considered a comedy, and yet packs in more tear-jerking moments than any film I can recently remember (ok, except maybe Crash). The problem is that none of these moments are earned. We don't get to spend enough time with any of the characters, or find out enough about them, to particularly care when the director tries to hit us with another ham-fisted sentimental moment. The film also moves at a glacial pace. This is an example of a writer/director being a bit too precious with his own material. There are huge pauses after each attempt at a joke, almost as if the director wanted there to be time for the audience to get the joke, or to laugh. Alas, when we don't, it's painful. If it had been an attempt to look at dramatic comedies in a new light, it may have passed, but instead it throws in every romantic comedy cliché imaginable in the last 20 minutes. Most of which are somewhat absurd. Unfortunately, some great performances can't save this film.",The Family Stone

Claire Danes looks great too. Diane Keaton's character is at the head of this nutty family...despite that, I watched this movie waiting for something to happen & I had to stop watching when Sarah Jessica's character was being vilified at the dinner table.

118,SillyPuddy,everything but the kitchen sink,4,14 June 2006,"This film had so much potential in that it was well filmed and had a talented, appealing cast. Then left wing Hollywood took over and tossed all kinds of ""non-traditional"" family stuff at us. Son was deaf and had a gay partner who was black. Oh and then the mother has breast cancer. These are all secondary issues to the main plot of the strained romance between Parker and Mulroney. Geez. Talk about manipulative. The worst part is that the whole brother switch was done before and with more humor in ""While You Were Sleeping."" Diane Keaton played a role that was totally against type. The only character that makes this watchable is Luke Wilson.",The Family Stone
119,catfarmer1358,Dermot,7,14 December 2018,I don't know why I keep coming back to watch this every Christmas season. This movie is almost unbearable to watch in the first have but gets better in the second half. Sarah Jessica Parker is so annoying in the movie. The best parts are probably Dermot Mulroney and Luke Wilson. I will say that despite its flaws the movie does have a lot of heart which might be why I come back to watch it every year.,The Family Stone
120,dennis_chiu1,One of the Best Christmas Movies of Recent Years,10,13 September 2009,"The Family Stone is one of the very best Christmas family films of the last 10 years. The main characters feel cut from the cloth of real life. The plot is a bit forced towards farce. However, if you knew my extended family through marriage, the plot was only slightly forced.The performances were great. Particularly Craig T. Nelson, who gives a quiet and powerful performance that involved the issue of the sexual orientation of one of his sons. Sarah Jessica Parker is amazing playing against type. Claire Danes and Diane Keaton portrayed fascinating and amazing women. The entire ensemble cast was fantastic.I wonder how much of this film, written and directed by Thomas Bezucha, was inspired by real life, because so much of it resonated with everyone in my extended family that watches it over and over again. There is truth at the heart of this story that lingers in the soul.(BTW - It seems to me that those reviewers, who thought the family was ""terrible"", must think Sarah Jessica Parker's uptight, snobbish, and ignorantly homophobic character was a hero, instead of a mess.)",The Family Stone
121,GrimmBrother,A terrible depiction of family life,3,24 December 2006,"The Plot During The Stone family's annual Christmas holiday weekend, a son brings home his self-centered, uptight girlfriend who talks too much, with plans of proposing. The Stone family instantly gives her a hard time. Overwhelmed by the hostile reception, she begs her sister to join her for emotional support, triggering further complications.The Pros The film has a few witty lines but nothing too memorable. Rachel McAdams' ""mean girl"" character is probably the best reason to watch this film, as there is nothing else that is really interesting, although the acting is rather decent.The Cons The film seems overly long and it is very boring. Family fights at home are more interesting than this rubbish. The plot may sound interesting, but once you start watching this you'll want to turn it off. What's worse is that everyone classifies this as a comedy when it is no such thing. There isn't a funny scene at all, just awkwardness sand stupidity. Sarah Jessica Parker was utterly annoying as well. Not only that but it is predictable too.The Final Word Don't even bother with this film. It is a poor imitation of family life, which doesn't come across well on screen.",The Family Stone

I am NOT a Diane Keaton fan, but the supportive cast made this movie fun for me. A couple of things were a bit over the top for me; one, is when Everette falls for his soon to be sister-in-law (Julie) in a matter of hours after meeting her, and two, Rachel McAdams's character falls in love with Brad after a year's absence from losing her virginity to him....now come on! I will say this: everyone did a fantastic job acting their parts, and I've not enjoyed Diane Keaton in a movie since she made ""Reds."" Luke Wilson, Craig T. Nelson and Sarah Jessica Parker are wonderfully talented actors. They have what it takes to make a movie work. Overall, I enjoyed the plot, the diversity of characters and the conversations among all of the characters as well.

Having decided they will dislike her even before she arrives, the plot writers seem not to have realised that if she is so appalling before she arrives for one brother, the family should feel equally appalled for another brother.The saddest thing about this film is that rudeness to a guest seems to be acceptable when the family defend their own bohemian beliefs .It is truly not worth watching.Had I been the girlfriend I'd have beat a hasty retreat and been glad of a lucky escape!''Here happy Xmas ..have a nice life ...have your ring back ...BYE ...''",The Family Stone
124,Nezz,A solid and fun way to start the year '06 of film,7,14 January 2006,"It always bewilders me when you see clips and trailers for a film and it's presented in one way and then you end up seeing it and it's vastly different to what you expected it to be. The Family Stone has been marketed so freely as some sort of frivolous piece of slapstick comedy that when the layers start to be drawn it sort of comes as a bit of a surprise.The strength of the film is the way the dynamic of the family is developed. Each character is given some time to grow on screen with all of the actors up to task. Keaton, Parker and McAdams have all garnered mention from a number of the reviews by both critics and posters on this board and they're all really good, particularly McAdams (but seriously in her short career so far has she ever been bad?), however, it was Nelson who was the one who stood out for me. Obviously The Incredibles has done something for his film career and here's hoping with what we got to see here that he's given more opportunities.Somewhat predictable, in the end it doesn't really matter as we're swept along with the way the family Stone progress through the trials and tribulations of the Christmas period. Other favourable factors included Giacchino's appropriately festive score and the sensibility of the director and writer, Thomas Bezucha, to stay just the right side of sentimental over-kill and in-your-face preachiness.A solid and fun way to start the year '06 of film.",The Family Stone

126,motta80-2,Delightful Christmas treat for adults to escape wizards and witches,9,7 November 2005,"A thoroughly refreshing film. The Family Stone is most reminiscent of Jodie Foster's Home For The Holidays, Parenthood and similar family gathering over a holiday films but is far superior.What is misleading is that at the start (and at various points along the way) it checks off the cliché boxes with aplomb: angry difficult youngest member - check; spoilt grandchild - check; reliable oldest daughter with absent husband - check; lovable rogue brother - check; younger homosexual brother check; inter- racial relationship - check; disability - check. Yup, going in this appears to be just another formula piece. Surely, it can't be any good.And yet, it is. The performances help tremendously: Luke Wilson is the most likable he's ever been; Rachel McAdams continues to shine; Diane Keaton is on top form as usual; Sarah Jessica Parker has never matched this performance; etc, etc. However, the script is actually superbly handled. Despite the clichés the film is sweet and good-natured without being saccharine. Each character is fully formed (with one notable exception) and the dialogue rips along with vigour.There are many occasions when you know exactly where the film is going but that doesn't matter because its a delight to spend a couple of hours with this family. Anyone who's ever had a big family gathering whether there own or tagging along with a partner (and it needn't be on the scale of this one) will find something they can relate to enjoy in this intelligent holiday treat.It is, however, let down by Claire Danes character. Danes herself is fine but she has nothing to do, she serves no purpose. And worse her character is involved in a romantic subplot that never feels earned, that is thoroughly unconvincing and seems forced. It seems as if this must have been a bigger story that might have been cut down in the editing to get the time down but at about 105 minutes the film doesn't overstay its welcome and more of this story would have helped make the film a holiday classic instead of just the enjoyable holiday diversion it is.Worth watching as an escape from magic and mythical beasts this Christmas but will be best enjoyed in front of the fire with the family at future Christmases.",The Family Stone
127,sugar_daddyo,The Family Stoned,2,13 May 2006,"This is your family; this is your family on drugs. I am not giving it a 1 rating simply because I think there was one thought provoking scene, like what not to do as a parent of adults, and I can actually think of more than 10 lines to say about this movie. As for the spoiler warning, this movie does not need it because if you can't figure out what is going to happen in the first 30 minutes, you are probably stoned as well. In fact, getting stoned would have been a better use of time than watching this schlock.But on to some more sober comments. We are left to believe (and why this was never simply stated) that Meredith is a successful banker from Manhattan/Bedford. Yet despite her success in the business world, she acts like a lost puppy at the Stoned Home looking for someone to scratch her belly and make her leg jiggle, ""Doesn't anybody love me!"" I guess few things in life are worse than being spurned by your boyfriend AND his hippy/stoner brother.It is obvious that Hollywood is legitimizing deviant behavior at the expense of conventional wisdom. We can all feel good about the deaf, mute gay brother and his black, gay lover who adopt a black baby, while we gleefully push and twist that knife deeper and deeper into the WASP establishment's back. Just look at how hateful Meredith was at the dinner table. However, combining this with the sibling swapping at the end has more in common with the inbreds of Appalachia and Jerry Springer's guests. I always lose a few brain cells when I watch Jerry, and I know I lost more than a few after this movie. Plus there is a jolting reminder that your parents really do have sex, as much as you want to delete it from your mind. On second thought this is your family on an acid trip!If you are thinking that this is some sort of brilliant combination of ""Meet the Parents"" meets National Lampoon's ""Christmas Vacation"", it's not. You'll wish you put an ice pick through your eyeball after watching this on Christmas!",The Family Stone
128,peteranderson,A Good Film! (Contains Spoilers),8,24 December 2005,"Contains Spoilers!I enjoyed this film! A good film and a god effort. The genre of this film was drama and comedy. And a perfect comedy drama it was. The comedy was certainly their from fantastic one liners and from the plot itself with a funny outline of Sarah Jessica Parker going to meet her boyfriends family for the first time. Great one liners, fantastic comedy situations and really funny elements. The drama made the film be very moving also. Many near me were crying when certain dramatic moments occurred such as when Diane Keaton's Character passed away. The dramatic story lines which occurred happened to a high level of drama and the comedy which occurred happened to a high level of comedy, so therefore the film was good because it hit its genre and target audience very well. The acting was superb. Diane Keaton was great, if she doesn't win an award for her performance it will be criminal. She was extremely funny and comical when appropriate and extremely dramatic and moving when appropriate. Overall a great actress, probably one of her best roles. Rachel McAdams has yet again improved with time. In my red eye review I said she was good and will be offered better roles in future as she was good in Red Eye, she was even better in this as the stroppy young adult, very funny. All the actors and acting were and was amazing apart from Sarah Jessica Parker who I didn't think adjusted to the role as well as she should have. Bar minor problems like that a good movie. But overall a good movie. Highly successful in what it set out to do. An 8.",The Family Stone
129,asalem182,A Mixed Stone,7,21 February 2006,"The Family Stone was a mixed bag. It had great acting, laugh out loud scenes, and heart breaking moments, but in the meantime, I felt it didn't know what it wants to be, some of the characters were stereotypes we've seen a hundred times before, and I thought some of things happening were totally unbelievable.The film tells the story of uptight businesswoman Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker) who meets the parents of her boyfriend Everett Stone (Dermot Mulroney) for the first time during the Christmas celebrations. From the get go, The Stones don't like Meredith, so she calls her sister Julie (Claire Danes) to come back her up.The picture didn't know whether it wants to be a slapstick comedy, or a heartfelt drama. One minute we see pratfalls, the next we wee people crying and talking about the freedom of sexual orientation. These fast mood swings really hurt the movie, as it was at its best when it kept the same tone for more than 10 minutes; I was laughing out loud at the Chritmas morning scenes, and I was really touched by the scene between Sybil (Diane Keaton) and Kelly (Craig. T Nelson) in the bed.The movie had a lot of characters, but unfortunately, only half of these characters were interesting. The best character was Sybil, the loving and strong mother who keeps all the family together. I also liked Everett, the man who wasn't sure of the decision he's going to make. Anyway, there also some stereotypes like Meredith and Amy (Rachel McAdams), the annoying sister who was just there to hurt Meredith. I felt Susannah (Elizabeth Reaser) and her daughter Elizabeth (Savannah Stehlin) were in the picture just to add a cute little girl to the mix. And I think the film could have used more time to give us a better idea of some characters like Julie and Ben (Luke Wison). But it's always a good sign when you wish a film was longer; Frankly, I was entertained throughout the film.The Family Stone had a great cast, with some actors giving their best performances in a long time, and I'm surprised no one from the cast was nominated for an Academy award. Diane Keaton was terrific as the mother, and her first and last scenes in the movie are truly heartbreaking. And although I'm not a fan of Parker, I thought she pulled of her role quite well. In fact, I think Danes is the only cast member who gave a so-so performance.So, I'd recommend The Family Stone, but with a cast like this, I can't help but think this film could have been much better.",The Family Stone
130,billmarsano,"Utterly false to life, desperately plotted",3,28 December 2006,"Although it would be hard to actually SPOIL this thing. OK, it had a couple of good lines and a couple of funny scenes, but not enough. Most of the performers were attractive-looking, but almost all were jerks. The Smug Mom: when you have to pull a fatal illness out of a hat to make her tolerable (with a half-hearted try at saintly), you're desperate. When one brother falls for his fiancée's sister as soon as she walks in the door, you're not only desperate but obvious--it's so clear that his brother is going to fall for his soon-to-be-ex-fiancée. This isn't plotting--it's housekeeping. Everett is a weak little priss (women who fall for stiff like him are doomed to a lives of getting sozzled at the country club). He gives his fiancée almost no support. She becomes so frazzled that she--get this!--invites her sister to come help her out! On what planet does that happen? Just asking. Equally obvious: the filthy sister who's supposedly a teacher (but who looks and acts more like a high-school mean-girl-in-training, age 15) is going to have her problem wrapped up prettily, but Bezucha first does a terrible thing: he violates formula, which here requires that she first get her comeuppance, preferably at the hands of Meredith (there are BOOKS about this). There's a flirtation with that: drunken Meredith invites 'the guy who popped her cherry' to the big Xmas dinner. Formula requires that this lead to a terrific donnybrook (certainly better than the lame 'battle' betwixt the 2 bothers) before everything ends well, but Bezucha doesn't know how to pull it off. He hints that it's going to happen and then leaves us hanging. It's OK, even good to violate formula, but ONLY if you Make Something Of It. Having Brad and the bitch shyly make cow eyes at each other at the front door just doesn't cut the mustard. Similarly, uptight Everett and uptight Meredith really are made for each other; why does Bezucha pry them apart? Loose-as-a-goose Ben and the other sister are likewise, so why does Bezucha pry THEM apart. Well, this is a m ovie in which very little happens, and unless Bezucha does those ridiculous stunts, NOTHING will happen. But if they're going to fall for their total opposites in less than 1 minutes, could we at least have a LITTLE character development squeezed in, a telling incident? No. Not here. They fall irrevocably in love simply because Bezucha tells them to. The pregnant sister without her husband--what's she there for? What the hell's Dad there for? The two gay lovers aren't a couple but an excuse for some cheap jokes, as is the fact that one is deaf. Please, people: the shout-at-the-deaf gag was done, done DONE for all time by Garrett Morris on Saturday Night Live--30 years ago! Did Bezucha really think he'd made something new out of it? Nah. All of this nonsense plods and stumbles along in the hope that no one will notice what it really is, which they will if it stops long enough for anyone to regain consciousness. These are not real people, just cardboard cut-outs mouthing mediocre gags. As for the question is Sarah Jessica Parker ugly?--the answer is no. She's a little bit pretty and can look really smashing when she's well dressed, because she wears clothes with great style. Unluckily for her, she was dressed here to be uptight and mainly looked cold and old. I mean older than her actual 40 years. She should sue. She also looked bad in ""Failure to Launch,"" opposite Matthew McConaghey, the world's sexiest corpse. With him for a leading man and an equally lifeless script, she ought to be looking for a part in the next Star Wars. In a just world, both of these are straight-to-airplane movies. But the world is not just and HBO is desperate for product.",The Family Stone
131,justicewillprevail,It's life... Abbreviated,7,1 January 2006,"Have you ever tried too hard to be someone else? Ever had a bad case of verbal diarrhea? Meet Meredith Morton, the new girlfriend meeting the family for the first over Christmas, who is stricken with this malady when visiting the Stone family. There is one scene in particular that is a riot, where she puts her foot so firmly in her mouth, it comes back out the other side.Cynic, slacker, stud, homosexuals; the cast of characters are an interesting bunch. As far as the story goes, there are simply too many clichés to be believed and it's frustrating that the pace is slightly uneven but hey, isn't life equally unpredictable? There are flashes of brilliance that make this film work, mainly a strong performance by Diane Keaton as the mother hen who hides a dark secret. Indeed, I believe that there are characters that everyone can relate to: two who are conforming to a dream of an ideal which binds an otherwise free spirit, others who are non-conformists who revel in being different.On the flip side, as mentioned earlier, all these events happening in one place at one time is slightly ridiculous. So if you simply cannot bear to see any errors and inconsistencies in a movie, please avoid this like the plague. Relationships develop and end with amazing speed and sometimes you are left wondering, can there truly be no hard feelings? Once you get over that hurdle, you are left with a diamond in the rough. An ambitious plan that threads a fine line: to be more believable, the script would need to be an epic that traces the dynasty over a long period and the audience would fall asleep, so compress the time line and this is the result. I gave this a 7/10 just for being different from the norm. In the age of instant gratification, the director chooses a more introspective approach, as opposed to ""Meet the Parents 3"". If you come from a big family, or have a large extended family, you'd probably appreciate this show more than most. This show is not really a laugh-fest, it is a compendium of all the inside jokes you'd find at a family gathering, not for everybody especially if you're looking for slapstick.",The Family Stone
132,Love_Life_Laughter,Funny and Sweet - my Go-To Christmans Ensemble Movie ** Contains Spoilers,10,5 January 2017,"Here it is, 2017, and I am writing a review of a movie released in 2006. Perhaps it is because I lived for 20 years in the Boston area, so many of the nuances ring true (Bedford is, after all, considered a high-end suburb) but I just love this movie. I must have watched it over 20 times and it never fails to delight. I guess you can call it my personal ground hog day. Let me count the ways I love this movie - 1) Not a note rings false - ensemble casting at it's best. And the actors seem to know it - they appear to be enjoying themselves. 2) Incredible talent across the board. 3) Watching the Meredith character shed her false rigidity to even the point of believing herself a full-fledged skank, while whining about it all of the time, is one of the funniest portrayals I've ever seen. You can see why John F. Kennedy, the man who could have practically any woman, chose Sarah Jessica Parker for a relatively serious fling. She is an intelligent, sweet hoot. That is all there is to it. 4) The rest of the performances are equally fabulous. That area of Massachusetts (the way Western part), is rather unique. You would have to grow up there, like I did, to really appreciate it I guess. The campus depicted there is where I saw Gwynneth Paltrow perform Shakespeare live on stage on the cusp of becoming famous, and where the front desk told me that Paul Newman was in the B&B. An intellectual Hollywood East of a sort. Not one detail of the movie rang false, from the Volvo to the bags of food from Whole Foods. Thank you for this fabulous gift that keeps giving - the quirky ensemble movie serving up a large helping of both laughs and pathos. I will enjoy it for years to come. For those who don't get it and can't see past the skank factor, this movie is about a loving family in crisis, in particular, in denial that they are about to lose their matriarch to cancer. The ""good"" son is unconsciously using magical thinking, trying to be super-good by wearing the tie, the suit, and bringing home the conservative (he thinks) fiancé. The irony is that the fiancé herself is a bit of a ""freak"" (non-conformist) and that she herself discovers this at the same time that the family comes to terms with the imminent loss of their beloved mother. A psychologically astute, funny and moving film.",The Family Stone
133,Ashlevine,Well done!,8,27 May 2006,"There are many stand out performances in the film including the brief appearance from Claire Danes. Two performances in particular, Sarah Jessica Parker who plays a very believable role as the tightly wound women clinging on to meaningless style of life and Diane Keaton's dying mother role that she delivered with the grace of a great actress. Through the film you can't help but wonder why are you so able to look at the insanity of other people's lives but fail to see your own. The film is touching with solid moment of really quality story telling. This is the type of film that is so rare from Hollywood. No car chases. No guns! No special effects. Only thing present in the film is great acting and wonderful story telling. Bravo!",The Family Stone
134,cineasten89,a wonderful family story that takes place in Christmas time,8,4 January 2006,"The family Stone are unlike other families that you've ever met. In that family, Kelly and Sybil are the parents of five children - Everett, the oldest who is played by Dermot Mulroney, who comes home with a new girl friend, Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker), who everyone in the family immediately start to hate, Thad (Ty Giordano), the gay and deaf son who with his partner Patrick (Brian White) want to adopt a child, Ben (Luke Wilson), the laid-back brother who doesn't care what anyone thinks about Meredith, Susannah (Elizabeth Reaser), the only of the siblings who is married, but even if she is, the marriage is somewhat troublesome, and she has a daughter who is about ten years old and a baby is on its way, and finally, the youngest and most rebellious sister of all, Amy (Rachel McAdams). So, of course, when Everett brings Meredith home for Christmas, a disaster is predicted... Just as it seems to getting worse, Meredith calls her sister Julie (Clare Danes)to come and make a good impression. Love and trust keep the family together as some secrets are told. All simply, this movie is a feel-good movie, and perfect to watch during Christmas time, but can be watched anytime during the year. You will just love Diane Keaton's very different mother, unlike her role in ""Father of the Bride"" or any other movie she has been starring in during the years, Rachel McAdams' aggression about Meredith and Sarah Jessica Parker's business woman Meredith who is very unlike her Carrie Bradshaw in ""Sex and the City."" However, even if it is such a great entertainment, the ending may be a bit stuck out but yet good. This is surely one of the funniest and most entertaining movies of 2005.",The Family Stone
135,PortugalOle7,Predictable and busy.... but enjoyable,7,30 September 2006,"There seems to be a Christmas family comedy every year and most of them strike out because they are very ""blah."" The Family Stone provides many different little plot twists which is a switch from the predictable Christmas comedies about family dysfunction and banter. It provides a great cast with Diane Keaton, Craig T Nelson, Luke Wilson, and of course Sarah Jessica Parker.However, the film quickly tries to throw all these different plots at you, as if they ran out of ideas. It also turns very serious and somewhat into a drama after the first 30mins. From there the comedy is sporadic. Of course I find nothing wrong with the drama aspects because let's face it, life isn't always laughs. This film tries very hard to have the best of both worlds in terms of making you laugh and cry. I'm quickly reminded of one of my favorite Christmas comedies, Jodie Foster's Home For The Holidays, which achieves both so well. There's also the sad mother illness plot line (ala Stepmom).In the end the actors are enjoyable, even the irritating(effective) Sarah Jessica. The film is enjoyable as well but it leaves something to be desired because in certain parts you say to yourself, ""Didn't I see this one already?""",The Family Stone
136,bostonlatin,I can't stand it anymore,2,1 June 2006,"Political Correctness reigns in Hollywood, billed in the previews as a romantic comedy, the Family Stone turns out to be a character study of a bunch of annoying liberals.Diane Keaton playing the most smug, elitist mother on the planet. The kindly dad who still smokes pot with the old kids. The other 2 slightly less annoying daughters and two great looking sons. Casting was a bit strange with children aged 28 - 41 in real life playing people, I guess ages 20 - 32. In the end, most people will feel more sympathetic to the unlikely Sarah Jessica Parker who had to put with this family from college town, East Coast ville.Hollywood gives us: Crash (we are all racists), Lord of War (we are all evil gun runners), the Constant Gardener (we are all evil industrialists), Syriana, Good Night and Good Luck, and American Dreamz (fame suck up wannabes) I know I missed a few here from 2005/2006.Oy vey, give me the kid's cartoons like Over the Hedge.

137,fedtho,Serious points made to attack and defend this movie / Comment ratings show intriguing trends,8,31 December 2008,"For reasons so subjective I don't' feel like discussing them, I loved this movie. I caught it on TV on a December 31st and cried a lot, as it just kept addressing issues that were of extreme relevance to me...Now: I was particularly struck by the contrast between the pro and contra comments. I forced myself to read some of the ""negative"" comments (containing the recurring formula ""worst film I have EVER, EVER seen"" in their title), and I had to admit that these comments made perfectly valid points on several issues all through the movie that were hard to defend. I had chosen to push aside these issues so I could enjoy the movie. I could also say: I had been struck by most of them myself, but it didn't prevent me from diving into the story and characters.Then i began to look at the ""Was this comment useful to you"" ratings, and I realized something remarkable: roughly put (I didn't do a study of every comment), while the positive reviews got about two thirds of ""yes"" (yes, this comment was useful to me), the extremely negative ones almost invariably got about fifty-fifty of yes' and no's. Meaning strongly negative opinions (some of them outright hateful) got at least half of their readers on their side. At the very least, that made me think that there had to be something seriously wrong with this movie, and that still, I had managed to ignore it. I also realized that there were issues related to the U.S. of which I, as a European (German living in Switzerland), wasn't aware, but were very real and obvious in the States.I apologize for not ending this with a conclusion that makes even a bit of sense: I didn't find any. Except a renewed confirmation of how subjective perception can be, depending on the mere MOOD one is in. When I watched this picture, I was in an absolutely non-critical, non-putting-into-perspective mood, only concerned with emotions and with what I could relate to within the boundaries of my personal life. So all the while I was watching, I extracted exactly what I needed out of what I saw, not an ounce more. I feel like having had a glimpse on why *anyone* can embrace *any opinion* at some point and feel he is absolutely right and sincere about his reasons. Kind of scary.",The Family Stone
138,jreinhardt-1,Don't bother with renting - go see the Manson family,2,23 June 2006,"I don't understand why Hollywood can't get it through their heads that this is not a normal American family. In all my years I have never run into a more dysfunctional, mean spirited, judgmental family unit in my life. We start the story with the family gathering around to welcome their eldest son, Everett (Dermot Malroney) home with his new girlfriend, Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker) home for Christmas. Immediately the audience hears the hate coming out of the youngest daughter, Amy(Rachel McAdams). Already the remainder of the family decides they do not like this new girlfriend (Meredith). Everett brings Meredith into meet his family & is happy to introduce her to them. The look of disdain on the families face is easy to spot & of course Meredith sees it as well. While talking to the mother, Sybil (Diane Keaton) in the living room - Sybil rolls her eyes constantly while Meredith talks about how she met Everett. I would hope that any other good American family would not treat a guest in their home with this much hate. This family would probably have turned Mother Teresa away. Meredith & Everett go up to take their luggage to their room & Meredith protests that she doesn't feel comfortable sleeping in the same bed with her ""Unmarried"" boyfriend in his parents home. She asks to sleep elsewhere. Which puts their youngest daughter, Amy out of her room. When I talk about youngest daughter I of course am referring to a girl of at least 21 - 24 years of age, but acts all of 12. Instead of the family understanding how any normal person might feel uncomfortable in these circumstances, they ridicule her. A big emotional eruption happens during Christmas dinner. Meredith asks Sybil to explain a comment she made about wishing all her sons were Gay like her youngest son, Thad. Meredith is trying to say that she doesn't understand why a parent would wish this situation on a child when the child would go through ridicule & cruelty in the world. The family erupts & yells at Meredith. Then the mother has to make the Gay son feel warm & cozy again, like he's 5. Didn't this kid ever get any flack out in the real world? He's deaf, gay & in a relationship with a gay Black man. Good thing he must have been raised at home & never went out into the real world. Meredith seems like she might be a person who could take a while to get to know, but this family doesn't even try. With the exception of Ben, (Luke Wilson) who seems to like everyone. Meredith feels so uncomfortable she moves out to a Bed & Breakfast. Soon she asks her sister Julie, (Claire Danes) to come help out. Meredith needs a friend. The problems however get worse when this family welcomes Julie with open arms but continues to give Meredith the cold shoulder. All the while all this is going one you find an underlying story. The mother seems to be ill. Of course this could be the reason for this families meanness - I hope there isn't another family like this. God help the guests. Things proceed on a predictable course when Everett finds himself more attracted to Julie then Meredith. Ben finds he's attracted to Meredith. So you can only imagine the rest of the story. The end warms up a bit after mom has died (oops). Don't worry you'll probably walk out long before this portion of the movie.",The Family Stone
139,lukalele,Painful,1,1 February 2008,"One of my pet gripes is films that don't give the viewer any credit whatsoever. This definitely falls into that category for me. What is this film trying to be? I was never quite sure. It certainly never lives up to it, whatever it is. A humdrum mess of painful, exaggeratedly clichéd, one-dimensional characters badly thrown together with some trite, unfunny slapstick and shallow 'romantic' and 'tragic' moments (which border on offensive for anyone that's been through such tragedy) might be more acceptable if the characters were at least remotely believable in any way, but they're not. There's no one to like or care about here, nothing for the talented ensemble of actors to work with at all. The dialog is so bad it'd be funny if it wasn't pretending at times to be so smart and insightful and socially relevant, especially the scene at the dinner table. By the time the film got to it's ridiculous epilogue, reached only after having to sit through scene after scene of the characters being so horrible to each other both to their faces and behind each others' backs, I had a hard time believing there was any of them alive by the end. And we're supposed to believe that this is such a close-knit family that they just can't accept an outsider into their lives? Oh, except if she's cute and educated and well-traveled and blond and bubbly but she's not perfect, no... she falls charmingly off the bus when we first meet her. Let's try to forget the fact that she'd betray one of her own close family members without a second thought. By the end not only are we supposed to accept all the backstabbing, two-timing and horrible exclusion with some laughably sickening, seemingly sensitive moments in between that are supposed to leave us in tears but seem so out of place that we've had to sit through... no, we're supposed be happy for them and the way things end up and the film is supposed to leave us with a warm-fuzzy happy/sad feeling but all I was left with was a feeling of rage and the need to eject the DVD and use it as a Frisbee. Aside from the epilogue we're also supposed to believe that they go through these life-changing moments (mostly at each other's expense, no less) in the space of twenty four hours, except for the characters that aren't horrible, but they're so boring and insipid you wonder why they're there at all.I've always made it a point to see every film I start to the end. This was the biggest challenge I've had in a long time. Everything this film's trying to achieve falls dead flat. Starts off bad and just gets worse.",The Family Stone
140,reeseslightning,Worst Holiday Movie I've Ever Seen,1,25 December 2012,"Holiday movies are supposed to make you feel good. That is basically their only job. From classics such as Miracle on 34th Street, It's a Wonderful Life, and A Christmas Story to newer stories like Love, Actually, Elf, The Santa Clause etc., - they all have several common factors:Love: whether it be friendship, family, or another kind.Feeling: They never take themselves too seriously. Whether the plots range from various interacting story lines, a man recounting his adventures as a child, or just a silly notion about an overgrown elf; none of these take themselves too seriously. They know exactly what they are - holiday movies that make the audience feel good.Characters: The characters must be likable! What is the point if the audience has no one to root for? At first glance, this movie would seem like a gold mine. The casting is some of the most talented actors in Hollywood. But it isn't. In fact, it's downright horrible. None of the common factors that I said above are present in this movie. There is not ONE. SINGLE. Likable. CHARACTER. Yes, we all relatives that are embarrassing but I guarantee you that if a family acted that way, no one would bring their partner home. The pacing of the movie was terrible. One moment one couple is in love and the next they're in love with each other's siblings. There are simply too many unlikeable characters in one place all bumping into each other with nothing worthy to show for it. The Stone family is also one of the most hateful families I've ever seen on screen. They are downright cruel to Meredith (Parker) from the start and are relentless in their pursuit to tear her down. They are akin to a pride of lionesses hunting down their prey. It's terrible to watch.Um, excuse me, what part of this movie is supposed to fill me with holiday cheer? Or any kind of cheer for that matter? I never laughed at any time and the only note worthy scene is the dinner table. Many people have said that this movie was written by uptight republican conservatives. Have they not seen the cast? 9 out 10 of them are known for their liberal views. But I'm just as lost as anyone as to why any of these actors would want to be in this god awful movie. The only reason I'm even giving this one star is because of Elisabeth Reaser of whom I am a major fan. Do yourself a favor and avoid this at all cost. It will not only kill your holiday spirit, but I'm pretty sure even Scrooge would be embarrassed that he pales in comparison to the Stone family.",The Family Stone
141,JimSDCal,A good Christmas comedy/drama,7,18 December 2005,"The Family Stone is a pretty good combination of comedy and drama. While it is an ensemble piece, the main members of the ensemble are Everett Stone, the somewhat yuppie son of the free-spirited Stone family, and Meredith Morton, a very up-tight business woman whom the Stone family takes an immediate dislike to. Meredith makes her predicament more tenuous by coming across as borderline racist and homophobe. In a game of Charades, for the film ""The Bride Wore Black"", for a clue for black she points at gay son Thad's black boyfriend Patrick. Later at dinner she further offends the Stones by opining that no parent would willingly want a child that was gay. After these incidents Everett begins to wonder if Meredith is really the woman for him. He has asked his mother to be given ""the family stone"", his grandmother's engagement ring to give to Meredith but questions whether it is her that he should marry. This is the crux of the story, but there are subplots concerning the health of the mother, Sybil Stone and the romantic prospects of brother Ben and sister Amy. By movie's end the proper romantic pairings are made, and this is shown the next Christmas which shows how happy each child is.",The Family Stone

Basically a family of stereotypical liberals (and if these are liberals I am ashamed to call myself one)are forced to welcome a new addition to their holiday celebration, Sarah Jessica Parker who plays an awkward conservative. Somehow the son, Dermot Mulroney's character turns out to be I guess he is also conservative I don't know that's why he's dating Sarah? Anyway there's a deaf, gay brother with a black boyfriend, there's a college student daughter, and DIane Keaton says something about hoping her children were gay, I don't know it hurt my head to watch.

144,barbie800,One Huge Mess,1,10 July 2006,"This movie ranks up there as one of the worst movies I've ever seen. First off, it's just one huge mess. It goes between trying to be funny, then trying to be serious, and then trying to be sad. I loved Sarah Jessica Parker in Sex & the City but I'm sorry, she was terrible in this role and couldn't act at all. Her character was so stiff. She reminded me of a robot. Her words didn't flow from her mouth and even her hair style was terrible. I didn't really like any of the other characters either. Getting to the plot, you would not even think that Meredith and Everett were a couple. They showed no emotion or spark between them. The thing that really got me was when Meredith calls her sister Julie for support. Julie arrives and Meredith says like 5 sentences to her the entire film. Then, Everett falls in love with her the same day he was supposed to propose to Meredith? Then Meredith falls for his brother? What the heck? I also did not understand the significance of the mother having breast cancer either. It was like there were too many different things going on in this movie that just didn't tie together. This movie actually made me mad. It made me mad that movies like this are actually made, actors get paid for doing them, then us as the viewer have to suffer through garbage like this because we don't know any better. The only good thing about this movie? Claire Danes. She looked beautiful and at least she could act. Other than that, stay far, far away from this one.",The Family Stone
145,stephen-dhondt,Meet the parents who are home for the holidays instead of having sex in the city,5,7 January 2006,"I want to be brief about this film, but I need to have 10 lines so ...1. the film is inhabited by stereotypes, not characters. there's the loving but ill mother. The strict but kindhearted father. The inappropriate sister. The doped up brother. The successful but hating life brother and his uptight big city desperately-needs-to-get-laid-good-wife. Oh, not to forget deaf gay man and his black lover ... At one point I thought Jerry Springer was gonna walk in and we were going to witness a big b*tch fight ... sadly Jerry refused to participate in this film.2. the director is also the writer. Which is only a good thing if the writer/director has a clear vision of what his film should look like. Clearly this guy doesn't quite know what he wants his film to be. It's either a bad drama or a bad comedy. Let's just call it a bad 'dramedy'.3. the acting ... OK, the acting is pretty good all over. Especially from Rachel McAdams (who suddenly seems to be in every film I see) she has played so many different characters over the course of her last few films that I actually might accuse her of having some real talent. She's followed closely by Diane Keaton, who's actually on auto pilot in this one, but still manages to deliver a believable mom.4. wow, never thought I could write so much about this film.5. to sum it up: rent this on Valentine's Day with your girlfriend, so you can later explain to her why you won't be taking her to meet your parents any time soon.

It starts off quite well with an interesting development of some of the characters, then gets bogged down in the middle. With the arrival of the other sister it is very funny in places. There is a problem with the film that may be localized. It seems badly edited with many unexplained bits. I also question if the ending was cut in Israel because I cannot remember an ending of 12 months later having seen the movie less than 72 hours ago. The scenery (and the snow) were quite beautiful but not one actor stood out as great (I confess to being a Diane Keaton fan) but it is certainly not the ""worst film ever"" quoted by another writer.

148,ysic2,This movie will have you screaming days later.,1,1 September 2006,"If you want a movie that will have you screaming a day later (like myself) then watch this movie. This movie is so frustrating.It starts off being like movies showing the family Christmas scene that portray a perfect loving family how everyone is so loving and adorable. Though, a little fake, you are still feeling this will be a warm hearted movie. No way! Meredith Morton (Sarah Jessica Parker) and her boyfriend Everett Stone (Dermot Mulroney) are heading to his parents home for Christmas- you know to meet the family.Meredith is pretty nerved racked about it. It's a big thing after all. She's a little bit tight and could do with relaxing but the family after hearing from Everett's sister Amy (Rachel McAdams), that Meredith is stuck up and also after witnessing Meredith's preferring a handshake than a hug to Everett's father, in no way tried to get to know her but just judged her straight away that she was stuck up and not worth knowing. The two worst characters are Amy and the mother (Diane Keaton) who didn't even try to get to know her, and definitely didn't try and make her feel welcome, this was left to the father after Everett told his family to stop being so rude for the umpteenth time, and said he was most disappointed in his father. The sister Amy while playing charades gave Meredith one that was so mean ""Brides wear black"" and then accused her of pointing to the black boyfriend of one of the brothers. Not only this, Mrs Stone and Amy make Meredith feel like it is the biggest crime as she didn't want to sleep in Everett's room as she thought it would be awkward and wanted to respect the family. Sorry, but I can understand that.Next the little girls decide to draw over Meredith's really good white heels in pink right in front of the family who say nothing. Meredith grabs them doesn't say anything and goes to her room. Again, the family are shocked at her.And Mrs Stone, when Everett ask his mother for his grandmother's wedding ring as promised, blatantly refuses saying she couldn't give it to ""that woman"". Meredith does suffer from a confidence problem and trying to please people and maybe not having the social skills like her sister, she is not easygoing, does need to learn to hold her tongue, and speaks without thinking but the family in no way respect Everett's choice or give Meredith a chance. I would hate to have this family as my own. Meredith then decides to stay at a hotelWell, Meredith decides to bring her sister Julie (Claire Danes) for encouragement. Oh, my goodness, big mistake. Okay, another way you get the picture of Meredith is her tightly pulled back hair and being immaculately dressed, compared to the lovely blonde sister Julie with her hair out and looking stunning and her casual but stylish clothing, and guess what Everett falls for her! I should mention this is straight after the fact that he just bought an engagement ring for Meredith. In fact the whole family falls for her. She is easygoing, more their style of person. Julie in no way tries to support Meredith, so poor Meredith is left to feel more alone and feels more insecure. Meredith tries to be helpful by offering to make a lavish breakfast, rather than thanking her and saying that it is really good and sweet of her, it is straight into, Everett's brother Ben (Luke Wilson) can't eat mushrooms.Everett and Julie, after one night and one conversation, (while out looking for Meredith after she ran away after a horrible row with the family  okay Meredith in the wrong with that one) Everett puts the engagement ring on Julie's fingers (to see what it would look like on- yeah right) and pretty much proposes to Julie.In the meantime, we capture Meredith totally drunk with Ben Stone as he takes her to a pub to calm her down. Meredith says to him ""I just wanted people to like me"". Next morning she is found in Ben's bed, and guess what happens, the father walks in looking pretty peeved at her. Meredith does a really sweet thing on Christmas day by giving them each a special present, an enlarged picture of Mrs Stone with Amy as a baby and the family start to like her. About time! Well, it doesn't last long before Everett says he wants to talk to her privately, she thinks it's to propose, (after seeing the ring on Julie's finger who can't get the ring off!). Meredith doesn't want him to ask, whether because she doesn't love him or because she thinks she slept with Ben Stone, but Everett says he proposed to Julie. Meredith says she slept with Ben whom points out that nothing happened. Meredith then says ""Why doesn't anyone love me?"" and Everett fights with Ben.Meredith then apologizes to Everett for everything. Everett says no I apologize and says nothing else. Why did she apologize? No more footage given of the sisters to talk it through, you know hello, I am about to steal your boyfriend/fiancé, is it okay?? but Meredith doesn't seem to feel anything about that. Meredith then snuggles up to Ben and it seems as though everything is dandy with her. Too convenient I say, they don't even suit, but he does seem to loosen her up a bit (with a bit of alcohol). I am not saying that that Everett would've worked but they really painted Meredith to be the only problem in this movie. And yes, Julie and Everett get together and do we say this a feel good movie???",The Family Stone
149,restin_him,Great acting Directing but bad story!,3,16 May 2006,"First I want to say, every actor in this film was fantastic. I thought they did a great job and really portrayed their characters well (which was part of the problem with the film). It was also a very well done film. It looked good and had a great atmosphere.The problem with this film is the story. We start this story off by learning that poor Meredith (Parker) is nervous to meet Everets (Mulroney) family. Immediately we see that this won't be easy thanks to Everets sister Amy (McAdams). Soon (like 5 minutes after meeting Meredith) we see that Everets family not only dislikes her but hates her. Eventually Everet even gives into hating the women he desires to marry. Eventually Meredith is so hurt she gets a room at an Inn and calls for her sister (Danes) to join her as moral support.Quickly we side with the nervous and misunderstood Meredith and begin to hate the Stone family (with the exception of brother Ben played by Wilson). They are mean, spiteful, and all around disgusting to Meredith making you wish the boiler would blow in the house while she is at the inn. Add to this a horrid love affair between Everet and Merediths sister and you get pretty sickened by these people. However everything ends up OK with Meredith accepted and in love with Ben while her sister hooks up with Everet.Personally this made me sick. To think that one can so quickly dismiss what was love (everet) and then have Meredith be OK with it. Add to this that Meredith spends the entire movie apologizing for stuff others have done and they NEVER apologize to her. She gets them all teary eyed with a beautiful gift and NO one at all says they were wrong, or sorry, or she was treated unfair (Amy does sniffle something at her but that is it).One can not just treat people like filth and then whip it clean with a good laugh on the kitchen floor. All in all this movie showed a disgusting image of relationships and how one can be a horrid person with no consequences as long as you spill food and have a good laugh over it.",The Family Stone

I turned it off after 20 minutes and figured I'd watch a really bad movie, so I started watching ""Last House On The Left."" But then, I thought of something and returned to it...Sure enough, as I writhed through the next hour and twenty minutes, I came to discover this horrible catastrophe was so bad it was good! Like looking at the Grand Canyon, my brain had to forge all-new neuron pathways in order to comprehend its immensity and grandeur as a cinematic disaster.And my brain needed re-forging.Imagine my delight to bear witness to a major Hollywood ""holiday comedy"" that was so utterly uncheerful and achingly unfunny that it seemed to scoff at the entertainment experience itself.I cackled with burgeoning glee as I watched major actors grapple with hopelessly unsympathetic and rudimentary characters trying desperately to stay with a flaming train wreck of a script.I roared with approval as scenarios careened wildly out of the realm of probability and plunged into the abyss of absurdity.I felt my heart soar as comic plot points seemed to disappear into the ether, while somber subplots emerged unceremoniously from nowhere to add a leaden sense of gravitas to the mess.I stared in slack-jawed awe as I watched Sarah Jessica Parker struggle to act like a drunk, Dermut Mulroney try desperately to show emotion, and Craig T. Nelson try to do the subtle quirky thing, all the while wondering what form of emotional turmoil the writer was suffering from when he wrote Rachael McAdams character. All in all, the only thing missing was the running commentary from the Mystery Science Theater 3000 guys.",The Family Stone

I would have left with my girlfriend/boyfriend. if my family wouldn't stop being rude. My sister would have been smacked in the face. The actors are good. Good enough to appreciate the fact this takes place at Christmas.AND, the Julie character is a completely dense character! She should have stood up for Meredith and have followed her out to the car, etc. And, not put on a ring. To sit most of the time looking dumbfounded was just to have the face of Clare Dane showcased.A contrived attempt to pair Everett and Julie!!! And, the Stone family welcomes her from the get go. Was obvious the script writer was going for switching the sisters.",The Family Stone
157,Cinesnatch,Was Expecting Worse,6,29 June 2006,"I went into this film with an open mind and low expectations. Afterall, it was a Hollywood holiday film for the family; it didn't have great potential. Apparently, my preconceived notions allowed me to enjoy myself. The screenplay is episodic at times, but the writing is decent and the performances are surprisingly fresh. Sara Jessica Parker has the enviable task of playing a fairly unlikeable character, but carries it off well. She plays a woman meeting her boyfriend's family for the first time. Everything pretty much works against her favor. Keaton, as usual, is in her element and Rachel McAdams is a lot of fun. The ending is trite and predictable, but I enjoyed most of the action leading up to it.",The Family Stone
158,ClassicMovieFans,"A good, warm film about relationships",9,3 September 2006,"Mrs. Stone (Diane Keaton) was the well-loved mother of four. It was a few days before Christmas. Her daughters Amy (Rachel McAdams) and Susannah (Elizabeth Reader) were already at home awaiting the arrival of their brothers Thad (Tyrone Giodarno), Ben (Luke Wilson) and Everett (Delmot Mulroney). The siblings were close, well brought-up, liberal, open-minded and all adored their parents.In come Everett's girl friend Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker) and tension set in. With Meredith's uptight and serious manner, the Stone family had problems showing hospitality. Nothing Meredith did could improve their impression, especially Mrs. Stone's and Amy's, and things kept spiraling down the wrong path. Worse still, Everett wanted to claim the family stone, grandma's ring, to propose to her. What everyone saw wrong in Meredith, Everett ignored until Meredith's sister, Julie (Clare Danes), was called in and the truth finally dawned on him.The movie is appealing for the closeness of the Stone family. The Stone family is one to be admired because love and respect abound. They were against Meredith's values which would surely jeopardize the unity of the family and more importantly, made Everett unhappy. They accepted Julie as readily as they rejected Meredith. Yet Meredith did one thing right. Her Christmas gifts to the Stone family made melted their hearts.I highly recommend the movie. The casting is excellent. Rachel McAdams (Notebook, Wedding Crashers) is attractive as ever and plays the uncompromising sister well. Luke Wilson and Tyrone Giodarno are perfectly convincing as brothers with a good heart. Clarie Danes as the lovable Julie often steals the scene. The outburst scene at the dinner table is well-captured. I also like the comical and hilarious touch when Meredith is rejected (twice!) and ended up with a roar of laughter, including Meredith herself, among the women. The philosophy about love throughout the film is consistent  you never know who's the right person until you meet him/her; once you do, you should go for it and let bygones be bygones. The only not so plausible plot is that having lost one's love, true love can turn up so soon. This is a Christmas love story with a fairy tale ending.",The Family Stone

It may not be your family, but it is indeed a real uppity/oddball family-with all its faults, joys and sorrows.If you gave this film a poor rating, I urge you to try viewing it once again. As a film, it is a wonder--the script, direction, photography, music, set-design, and the ensemble cast is among the very best. Each role is pitch-perfect! The holidays are such a complex time for many of us. This film pays a most unusual respect to the realities we face in the age of today, within or without the family unit.I guess I love this film most because it captures truth in a way that touches me deeply. It is about a few of the life encounters which all humans experience one way or another, and reveals our most private moments with unusual insight, humor and compassion.And, as with any great film, it has much to reveal with each viewing.Enjoy!",The Family Stone

The copy on the DVD says its a ""deliriously funny comedy."" Yes, it does have some humorous moments in it, and it's light in nature despite the sad things going on like the revelation that Diane Keaton's character, the matriarch of the family, is going to die. I almost didn't watch this because I wasn't in the mood for a ""hilarious comedy."" To my surprise, and pleasantly so, it was a well-constructed drama (with comedic elements) but a far cry from laughing out loud. As a matter of fact, I didn't laugh once during the entire film, but I loved it. I thought the characters were well drawn and I cared about them.This is all very subjective. I laugh at things others do not find funny and have hated films that many loved (""Intolerable Cruelty"" and ""Anchorman""). And I have enjoyed films that other people enjoyed (""Meet The Parents,"" ""Bringing Down the House"").This is a thought-provoking movie, but not so deep that it makes your head hurt. I would definitely recommend it, but in my subjective opinion, it's far from a side splitter.",The Family Stone

She did not fit in at all-her performance was awful. Diane Keaton was wonderful as usual, and there were some funny moments with Rachel McAdams who I loved in The Notebook and Mean Girls. SJP was so wooden and stiff and her character was a cold hearted B****. I wouldn't have cared had we never seen her character again after the first 2 scenes-the dinner table scene was awful as well-her comments were clearly racist, bigoted and homophobic.Aside from the 1 casting mistake, it was a very good dramatic film with some sweet funny moments.

I grew up in a family with five children, and I thought the family dynamic between the cast members was spot-on perfect. The story flowed like a well-written piece of music. The house was amazing too, it was like a character itself. It looked so much like a home. I wouldn't call the family dysfunctional, myself. They seemed like a real family, with the squabbles, infighting, silliness, and all the love behind it. They made me want to be a part of the family.It's a comedy, and Sarah Jessica Parker is a real fish out of water through most of it, but there's so much more to it. A very poignant movie. It will make you laugh, make you cry. So if you like a movie that plays to your heart, this one will.",The Family Stone
165,jora_dyn,horrible film. maybe a star for effort....,2,29 April 2006,"I was expecting so much more from this film based off of the trailers and promotions. But I guess this movie really goes to show that just having an amazing cast cannot save a film.The timing was bad, the humor had some occasional moments but they were few and far between. The premise seemed to be a sort of Meet the Parents type story, but then just went berserk. I suppose in some of sadistic type way you actually enjoy the family's dislike of Meredith. She really does seem like an easy to hate type of person.The writing was terrible, the story was erratic and impractical, and lets not even go on with the character development... because there was none. Basically it seemed like this movie decided it didn't need character development, instead it could just bank on the previous roles that are associated with the cast.Everyone in the film just kind of played another version of themselves from their previous movies/TV series. Sarah Jessica Parker reprises her role as Carrie from Sex and the City, only this time her name is Meredith. She is taken to her boyfriend, insert the Dermott Mulroney character of your choice (whether it be him from My Best Friend's Wedding or Wedding Date...), home for the holidays. There she meets his family. Which includes Rachel McAdams as her Mean Girls character, and Luke Wilson in a sort of blend of his role from Home Fries meets Royal Tenenbaums. Top it all off with Diane Keaton as the matriarch of the family which we've seen countless times... oh and also a guest appearance from Claire Danes being the Shopgirl...The relationships lack any feeling at all, and thus any believability, leaving you feeling absolutely nothing in the end. Well maybe a burning sort of hate and discomfort. One that makes you need to go out and write a review about just how bad you felt this film was.Ugh, even as I sit here writing this I'm thinking I may have rated it too high...",The Family Stone

Every person in the cast makes this worth seeing, but extra hollers go to Sarah Jessica Parker for NOT being Carrie Bradshaw and to Rachel McAdams, who once again, plays a convincing mean girl. Not only are the relationships believable (a bit smarmy at times, but nothing overly nauseating), the unraveling of the story that happens makes this not just about the holidays but about relationships, family and life. Btw, can we PLEASE make sure Craig T. Nelson shows up in more movies? He and Diane Keaton were amazingly believable and I just adore this teddy bear of a man!!",The Family Stone

Totally missed it at the cinema so I was wondering if it was as bad (or as good) as friends had told me. The film starts of quite funny. Family meets SJP, amusing, yes. After the first half hour the story sort of loses it way and Dermot seems pretty bored with the whole acting thing. I forget how Clare Danes gets involved, but by this time I was ready to start reading SKYMALL and decide what I didn't like from Frontgate and the Sharper Image. But I continued to listen and watch (mostly) the film and realized that the actors were all playing parts that they had played before in other films (except Rachel McAdmams perhaps). Dermot was playing the part he played in ""Best Friends Wedding"", Luke Wilson was the same as he was in ""Legally Blonde"", and they do it very well, but the writing really was predictable and in some parts, pretty poor. So in conclusion, I missed out on 90 minutes of sleep by watching this film, pity I did.",The Family Stone
168,dzhaviland,"Come on folks, this is Christmas Schmaltz at it's best!",8,26 December 2020,"So many reviewers hate this movie because, I think, they assume it's supposed to be an intelligent drama with moments of comedy. Instead it's about a flawed group of people who love each other dearly . They overstep each others boundaries constantly, but yet, their shared history of their mom's/wive's cancer, lends a heavy emphasis to her and the rest of the family making sure all of them will be happy and ok when she's gone. IN steps her oldest son who brings home this uptight, fully lacking in humor or self awareness woman, yet there is a vulnerability and sensitivity to her that only slowly appears. Until it does, the family hates her. Her sister shows up, oldest son falls for her, his brother falls for the uptight woman who is now flying her ""freak flag"" and still behind it all is their realization it is the last Christmas they will all be together as their mom is losing her battle. The unrealistic love relationships are not and should not be the real focus of the movie. It's what makes a family, the love that endures through flaws and struggles.

169,StuntsForFilm,A good movie,7,4 June 2006,This movie wasn't publicized very well at all but was a really good film if you just enjoy it and don't try to over-analyze the script. It's easy to get enthralled in asking 'Why is the son gay?' and 'What does that have to do with anything?'. Just sit back and enjoy Diane Keaton who was remarkable and carried the weight of the film. Mulroney and Danes had great chemistry together. The film will tug at all your emotions from hate to laughter and is appropriate for most all ages. I get the feeling that Director Thomas Bezucha just let Keaton and Nelson go most of the time since they have each worked on more films than he has seen. This was only his second film to Direct or even work on for that matter.,The Family Stone

I realize that doesn't mean an appalling movie, but it made me feel uncomfortable, angry and upset.The mother (Diane Keaton) acted like a spoiled queen, and her husband (Craig T Nelson) a weak consort. Naturally an urban young woman coming into this established rural New England home was going to have a rough ride, but the family should have been the ones trying to smooth the way for her; not putting road bumps along her path. Of course the mother's later-disclosed illness might excuse some of her behavior, but I received the impression that we were seeing her true colorsher illness merely amplifying them a little.As for her statementand other family members' understandingthat having been delivered of a gay son, she wished that all her children could have been born gay or lesbian; would she have felt the same is he'd been born blind, or with spina bifida, or with Down syndrome, or, or, or...What a wicked or stupid woman she was.Incidentally, I have never been a fan of Sarah Jessica Parker, but I thought she was superb in this movie.",The Family Stone

The director could have left you craving or wondering at the end, but instead, lets us in all the way.

With a cast like this, how can it be bad? I admit, I had pretty high expectations, and I was not at all disappointed.""The Family Stone"" is about a man, Everett (played by Dermot Mulroney), who brings home his girlfriend, Meredith (played wonderfully by Sarah Jessica Parker), to meet his family for Christmas. From the start, the family hates her, no matter what she does to try and convince them to come around. There are also many other smaller story lines involving the other family members, and some serious dramatic moments in the film. At the end of the day, it is about the importance of family, and approval by family.As I mentioned above, the entire cast was amazing. Diane Keaton, of course, gave much depth to her character. Sarah Jessica Parker was amazing here, and I respect her for taking a role like this, that is so against type for her. Rachel McAdams, who is quickly becoming one of the best actresses out there, while underused, was also amazing. She had some of the funniest lines in the film. Luke Wilson, playing Ben- the brother, gave one of his best performances ever. The rest of the cast, including Craig T. Nelson, Dermot Mulroney, and Claire Danes were also wonderful.I think ""The Family Stone"" is one of the best movies that has been released in a long time. I had comedy, drama, but most of all, it was smart. It was so refreshing to see a film made and possible aimed at adult people. Too many movies today, most really, are made for teenagers. The dialogue was intelligent here, and it never felt as though the filmmakers thought the audience was stupid.

179,hardcoresocrates,Wow. Floored. Amazing.,10,1 December 2005,"This is one of the better films I've ever seen. Top 5 on my list of all time. Easily.I'm afraid of sounding like a Fox exec or something, because I'm the first to write something, and I'm about to gush about this movie. Look up my history for some kind of legitimacy. Never has a film made me laugh so hard one second and cry so hard in the next. At several points, the film knocked the wind out of me in a funny moment and made me gasp with anguish on the next inhale. It is the perfect combination of the family comedy and character drama film. A film that could have gone indie, but instead went Hollywood enough to guarantee a larger audience will be touched by the film.I'm exhausted on the high of seeing the film and eating some great tacos tonight, so I'll try to break it down as succinctly as possible:ORDER OF BRILLIANCE (starting with the most effective)1. The Structure -- The way these characters are interwoven is brilliant and seamless.2. The Characters -- The people we're made to fall in love have serious faults that, depending on the situation, are hilariously fun or sadly crippling to them.2. The Acting -- This is, by far, the best ensemble performance I've ever seen. I love CRASH, but this ensemble has more group scenes than the one-on-one scenes that dominate CRASH.3. The Casting -- That's different than the acting. The balance was brilliant. Lovely to see Diane Keaton as the obvious choice for such a character, and lovely to see Sarah Jessica Parker in a not-so- obvious role. Luke Wilson plays sort of an aloof version of his brother Owen. Rachel McAdams; after this year, she's hand down the number one under-thirty actress in Hollywood.4. The Invisible Dialogue -- I don't know if the director telegraphed it to them or what, but the reactions of the actors, timed perfectly by the editor, were as important as the words the actors brought to the table.5. The Reveal -- You learn just enough about the story behind the story to get you curious for the next reveal. Their secrets deepen the characters and the bonds with one another.6. The Cliché Twist -- This being a holiday movie, you're going to expect characters to fall in love with who they're supposed to fall in love with, but these moments' realism and heart behind them turn the potential eye-rolling moments to moments that are sweet, tender and heartbreaking.From opening scenes, I was sucked straight into falling in love with this beautiful family; immediately aware of the distinction between the quirky characters and their unique relationships with one another. It touched me on so many levels. As a filmmaker, I aim to achieve maybe 3/4 of what I saw tonight by the end of my career  and the guy did it all on his second film.If you like solid movies with real characters in real stories, see this movie.ADDENDUM: I never watch trailers, until after I see the film. They inevitably ruin several key moments and revelations, if not the entire film. I recently saw the trailer, and I must say that it has ALMOST NOTHING to do with the real film. It makes it seems like a cute, cliché family film a la Meet The Parents. It is not. This may be why there's some backlash against it; it's a bit of a bait and switch, perhaps. Knowing my tastes, I would have never wanted to see this film, if I had seen the preview.",The Family Stone
180,rlgolden,Comedy et tragedy,7,17 June 2006,"The Family Stone covers three days in the life of the title family, Christmas Eve, Christmas and, briefly, the following Christmas so that it can wrap up the multiple story lines of the plot. One of the things I like about the movie is that this is not in your face as far as the tragedy part, no more than a few lines in a couple of scenes.Sarah Jeessica Parker plays against her type, a stuffy, straight-laced businesswoman and does a surprisingly good job throughout the movie. Luke Wilson is at his best, the laid-back brother to Dermot Mulroney who is called upon the bring Parker down to earth and Mulroney is the somewhat confused suitor who... well, you will just have to watch the movie.Craig T. Nelson also gets kudos for keeping you interested in his character. He plays Diane Keaton's husband and Keaton, one of the best actresses, sparkles. The film doesn't waste any time with character introduction, getting right into the plot but gives you time during the movie to see what each character is about. I took off a point because the movie is predictable to a degree.",The Family Stone
181,smithr1223,My recommendation: WATCH this film!!!,9,27 January 2007,"I genuinely loved this film and, based on reviewers descriptions and the promotion for it, I fully expected to hate it and doubted why I would even want to sit through it for free. What's most important to say here is that the reviewers, and the studio in their promotional work, did a grave disservice to this film and everyone who worked to make it. They should either be fired or ordered to do community service!This film's story is real life, messy, it's beautifully written and well acted. It's one of the best ensemble pieces I've seen in recent years (everyone does well though I felt SJP's performance was the least natural). Yes, the family is cold and occasionally mean to the newcomer, but that's occasionally what happens to newcomers as a family forces itself to flex to include them (we've gamely welcomed brother's wife #3). In reference to those reviewers who complain about Meredith's bigoted behavior, well I've been in homes where a guest has behaved that way, and it wasn't as well handled as it is in this film. I adore how the mother communicates with her son and only wish I'd witnessed that more often in real life. Far from those scenes being in the film to just 'be cruel', it honestly shows what prejudices people have to address regularly, and I love its uncomfortable honesty. I love that the truth is allowed to be the truth, unvarnished, as people find their way in a family and in their love lives.Overall, if you'll let it, this film takes you for a real emotional ride and hopefully will make you think about how your own family welcomes outsiders, will make you challenge your own prejudices, and make you value what you have in your family before the next major life change occurs. I loved it and it's quickly become a new holiday favorite for me...",The Family Stone

Everyone seemed as if they really were a member of the family, the chemistry was literally undeniable. This movie really showed what families can be like over the stressful time of the holidays. It breaks out imperfections, sadness and anger- feelings that you wouldn't think would be conflicted with the holidays, but in real life they do. I really think this movie is just another added classic. If you like holiday movies, or just normal everyday family movies- this movie is for you.I saw this movie for the first time just a few years ago and truly I've liked it ever since.

It's not an easy situation and she's perfectly nice and everybody is painfully mean to her.

I won't go into too much detail, but I promise you'll see it coming from a mile away and it's ridiculous. Utterly ridiculous. And then a year goes by and every ridiculous thing worked out.

184,ShawnM1,It's American psychology and pop culture incarnate.,3,23 May 2007,"This ambiguously amoral and unrealistic film is about self-serving people lacking in basic family values or rational behavior impulsively doing whatever 'feels right'. Persecution of the majority (not that any persecution is right) and complete chaos in the white middle class conscience. We have the divorce rate, incredibly obese and ignorant generations, and police state of a government to prove it. A lack of direction, culture, and good old-fashioned VALUES logically grounded by the world you grew up in. Full-grown adults licensed to act out in whatever way satisfies their 'emotions' and expect to be appreciated for it too.What makes this film bad is that it wasn't really TRYING to be those things. It just happened on accident. I give the film three stars by its ability to even provoke me, as based on the previews I didn't expect it to be even remotely provocative. The only thing it was genuine in was at revealing what completely immature quasi-romantic a*holes people can be. Guy takes girl to meet his family. The girl is hate-worthy merely for being SO uptight and concerned that she doesn't displease them. But the family is really disgusting in their lack of grace. Completely selfish, unsupportive, hypocritical, and self ritchous. I found myself annoyed that I felt any pity for the mom with cancer. I too wanted to get on a bus and go far, far, away, or stay in a hotel, just to get away from all these people. That was the only humor in the film. Based on virtually none of the characters being likable save the girlfriend's sister (played by Danes), the ironic twist toward the end is made even more annoying.We hated the characters, and by the end, hated the director for giving a somewhat happy ending.

186,thebuckguy,An odd film,3,30 December 2006,"This is one of those movies that can't be fairly reviewed without a few spoilers. The film builds from the premise of ""meeting the folks"" and the prospective spouse having to cope with a wacky, but ultimately lovable group of characters. Here, the concept is twisted a little bit by making the folks truly vicious and making the ""girlfriend"" insensitive and unlikable. Unfortunately, the film seems to be missing the kind of subtext that would make this irreverent, ironic or simply dark. Instead, the plot is filled with a collection of clichés and a hodgepodge of performances (some very good) that don't really jell. There's a cancer tragedy subplot, a diversity subplot (gay interracial couple who want to adopt) that uses two characters more as plot devices than as members of the family, there's a mean daughter, a hippie prodigal son, and an underlying set of political conflicts which present a tiresome rendition of conservative versus liberal (the twist here is that the right winger is the outcast). Sarah Jessica Parker seems miscast or at least miswritten as the girlfriend. The part would be better if she'd been written like Ann Coulter, who is insensitive, downright crazy and easily mocked. Ironically, having the character be a harpy would make the happy ending less absurd than the one in the film. Diane Keaton is actually quite good and there's real chemistry between here and Craig T. Nelson. Owen Wilson is fine although his attraction to the SJP character never seems real. The chemistry between Dermot Mulroney and Parker also is absent and one really doesn't get a sense of what brought them together. The mean daughter was actually my favorite, although we never get a sense of why she's so mean--she doesn't seem all that attached to her brother and the void in her own personal life never seems that real. The Parker character's younger sister comes and saves the day, although her arrival never really has much reason behind it and their relationship doesn't seem that close to require her to show up and support Parker. The ""surprisies"" that come at the end can be seen 100 miles away. The film is a good example of how a strong cast can't make up for a weak script and a weaker set of premises.",The Family Stone
187,todigy-1,Near-Perfect Family Movie,10,26 December 2005,"After my second viewing of The Family Stone, I was so glad to have given it another chance to add texture to the initial viewing's understanding. All of the movie stars put in fantastic performances, but the real overriding characteristic of this movie is its message--love and tolerance should override ideology and intolerance. The overarching sub-theme in the movie is that homosexuality does not have to be an item which should stop someone from being loved by heterosexuals. This was a perfect release time for a Christmas classic. I'm personally getting more and more enthralled by Rachel McAdams' beauty and Sarah Jessica Parker's outstanding acting ability. I tried to think of some deficits this movie might have (so as to talk over with my friend Jeanne), but I was left completely without any material.

191,Half_the_Audience,Serious Problems in the Family Stone,4,5 January 2006,"It is hard to know which player is most guilty of throwing the game in this charade of a comedy: the actors, the writer, or the director.In this painfully unfunny portrait of a quirky loving family, Emmett brings his cold and ""formal"" girlfriend Meredith home for the Christmas holiday. The family doesn't like her, she doesn't like them, and we don't know what the two of them see in each other.The performances from nearly everyone are lackluster and stilted, save Diane Keaton as the frustrated and regretful matriarch, and Rachel McAdams as a sibling lucky enough to have grown up with a relatively supportive family but has not found her own place yet. Luke Wilson does manage to portray the prodigal son with his trademark devilish charm. Dermot Mulroney completely misses the mark in his attempt at complexity and devotion to either his girlfriend or his mother.The writing is flat and uninspired, but a talented cast should be able to mine a script for moments that aren't on the page.The direction is either so precise or heavy handed as to not let the actors create characters that interact organically. It's hard to imagine that Sarah Jessica Parker (so authentically neurotic as Carrie Bradshaw in ""Sex and the City"") as Meredith would resort to pushing motivations, indicating, and ""playing"" uptight on her own accord. (I can hear the director now: ""That's not how my sister said it. Try it this way,"" only to follow with a line reading.) Unfortunately we know that both director and writer are the same person, so the finger pointing game becomes less of a challenge.It's a difficult task to present a main character that is unsympathetic and downright unlikable, unless they possess some an endearing flaw or have suffered some mistreatment that causes them to become that way. The Stone's react to Meredith with criticism and judgment before she's even arrived, only to have us agree with them after a few clumsy exchanges, not many of which are believable. Wilson's character tells her not to try so hard. I wish the director had followed the same advice.No doubt, the story is in some way autobiographical, as no one seems to have labored over creating unique ""comedic"" moments, but rather expectorated them as they happened in either real life, or in other mediocre movies. Resorting to slip and fall gags, and those old favorites, shouting at deaf people, and ""I got drunk last night and can't remember if I had sex with the wrong person,"" I heard only two laughs during the entire screening, both generated by the oafish warmth of Luke Wilson's delivery of otherwise incidental dialog.Press releases (and some reviewers) have lazily ascribed the term ""dysfunctional"" to the Stones, but this family appears to operate pretty well inclusive of the ordinary miscommunication we all experience in everyday life. If this is dysfunctional, I'd like to be adopted!The unsatisfying ending is so absurdly ridiculous that Meg Ryan's reaction when discovering Tom Hanks is her online pen pal in ""You've Got Mail"" looks realistic by comparison.At one point Parker's character screams, ""When is someone going to love me?"" My answer in five words: ""Not in this film, dear.""",The Family Stone
192,David65536,I can't believe I liked this movie 6 years ago,1,15 February 2012,"This movie is so awful that I decided to write this after viewing it on TV one day I was sick and awake at 1AM. I am liberal and so I didn't have any problem with the 'stoned' qualities of the family portrayed in the movie. SJP acting is really good and I disliked her character so much when I saw this movie about 6 years ago that I sided with the Stones.But I guess I have left my adolescent mindset and it is clear now how this 'liberal' family is a horrendous set of petty minded people. I could watch only an hour this time and being sick I didn't have too much else to do so that says pretty much how much I disliked the characters.We are supposed to be charmed by the quirks of this dysfunctional family, but the way they humiliate SJP's character -Meredith- is appalling to see. She escapes from the Stones' house and registers in a hotel after calling her sister to come for help. But in the scene when she is waiting for her boyfriend to drive her to the hotel, Luke Wilson's character shows up to give her a coffee in a mug that belongs to his mother who hates her (!!!) while doing this he is insinuating her physically and obviously hitting her, he even tells her he had a dream with her! Then Meredith's sister comes and she is immediately welcomed by the Stones, she seems to prefer them to her own sister anyway. After the sister asks a very awkward question to the gay couple and survives, Meredith feels confident to ask another awkward question failing miserably. But at this point the family is so over the top unlikable that I was on Meredith's side at this point. Meredith is humiliated again and she tries to escape again, but she collides with a tree and in that moment neither her sister or her boyfriend runs to support her. Luke Wilson's character acts as the saver and they end up having a sort of date which end with them sleeping together without sex. When Luke Wilson's goes away with Meredith her boyfriend ends up having a date with Meredith's sister who doesn't seem to care to much about her sister or about being romanced by her sister's boyfriend! There are other points of the plot that are contrived and don't make too much sense if you are non-judgmental with uptight people. Curiously this time I found Meredith the most likable (the only likable perhaps) character in the movie. With all her faults, she was only a snobby uptight girlfriend trying to fit in her boyfriend's family.The epilogue of the movie is unbelievable and only tries to be a feel good moment. I couldn't believe that this movie got so many good reviews when it was just released, but I liked the movie then too so I guess this movie is likable when you are as judgmental as the Stones and think that that gives you a license to be a jerk with uptight people.",The Family Stone

You cast Jessica Parker as the main character who everybody is supposed to love and cheer on...? Sarah Parker was good in one thing. Sex and the City because it suited her style but everything else was horse style... No i'm sorry, that's an insult to horses whom probably are better than her.Then the rest of the cast. Well the problem isn't the cast per say... but they have none chemistry whatsoever. I honestly don't see why Meredith or Everett are together because they clearly don't like each other and Meredith just goes in for being an awful hag as possible.
Everyone are just simply dicks to eachother for no reason which makes me question why they are even a family. 
Sure... every family has their problems but these people should be as far away from each other as possible. The only two redeeming characters are the gay couple because well they don't have many lines and they actually behave like a family should. And well Meredith didn't exactly improve her reputation by being a homophob and a rascist. For a christmas movie that is about spreading joy and happiness, they sure suck at it. 
There's the awful mother (Lois Griffin-style), ""waaay to passionate father that (like Meredith) tries too hard like it's forced upon him, the guy that hits on the fiancee, an asshat of a daugther, yet an annoying child that does nothing but make us cringe, the fiancee to Meredith who is a cheating bastard and Meredith who is a cheating, homophobic, rascist, un-educated bastard.
The only redeeming characters are Meredith's sister who just were at the wrong place at the wrong time (not really, it was planned...), the knocked up daughter, the gay couple and ...nope. Those were the only good part about the movie.When a christmas movie lacks a likeable cast, good writing, chemistry, good charisma, decent well behaved people... then it's not really a christmas movie is it? It' more of a soggy train wreck of a drama.There are plenty of other good MORE cheerful christmas drama comedies, worth your time. This... This is not.",The Family Stone
196,limeberry7,Average predictable comedy drama,4,3 November 2005,"It's very obvious from the start how this movie will go and what the end of it will be. The cast is great to watch but there are no character challenges here really - not that there is a need in that either. It is all good to the certain point when the clichés overwhelm the script so much that you are not even able to take seriously enough to drop a tear for the film's another tragic storyline of a dying mother Stone (Diane Keaton) who has not revealed to her kids that cancer is taking her life and it's it their last Christmas with her.The main plot is simple. A serious well-to-do son Everett(Dermot Mulroney) brings his soon-to-be-bride girlfriend Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker seems to have fallen into the trap of being type-casted as a neurotic yet stylish woman from New York) for his family's approval. She is disliked even before she steps her foot into the house - that is a premise for series of comedic situations when you witness the clash of personalities as well as their insecurities. Think ""Junebug"" but very 2-D. Amy, one of the sisters (Rachel McAdams) immediately makes Meredith's stay practically impossible by being the bitchiest family member while Ben (Luke Wilson), a free-spirited son (and predictably the opposite of Everett) lays his eyes and sees the good in Meredith even though she makes many tactless, sometimes even horrid mistakes contributing to the fact of being disliked by each member of the diverse Stone family. Diverse it is indeed, there is also a deaf gay brother and and his African-American boyfriend planning to adopt a child - they are a subject of one of the pivotal scenes in the movie when a little bit of a political message is brought up and it shows that The Stones are worthy of their last name by sticking up for each other and also there is pregnant sister (a character that is absolutely unnecessary and is in the movie to fill ""the more- the merrier"" cliché of family films). Claire Danes plays the easiest role of her career - Julie, Meredith's sister, who arrives to support her sister in a difficult time of trying be liked and predictably finds love in the family. Avoiding to reveal too much of the movie that gets sappier and sappier towards the end and runs out of comedy too soon, I would like to note that overall the film has a positive and kind message but we have seen it all before.",The Family Stone

Probably sinks to the level of ""Ground Hog Day"" for absurdity. I wanted to see a comedy. Instead, I was assaulted by a ""family"" of rude, inconsiderate ingrates who took an immediate hatred of the Merideth character without any reason provided by the writer or director. The Diane Keaton ""mother"" character should have been taken out and shot for her immediate dislike of Merideth and the motherly knowledge that her son's marriage to this woman would ultimately end in disaster. All this without knowing anything about her. Where did that come from? All in all, this is a poorly written movie with an ill-conceived plot line. The plot and character development (what little there was) left me wanting so much more. The only plus was that Merideth stuck it out with these ingrates and didn't flee back the the Big Apple. And then she hooks up and stays with the brother? Come on!!! Anyone in their right mind would have taken the first bus, train or automobile out of town as soon as possible.

I expected a lightweight comedy, based on the trailers, and instead it was a very effective tear-jerker with comedic moments. I think it was poorly marketed.The characters weren't entirely realistic -- what family would not try to be a little less chilly to a prospective daughter-in-law? What sister would hear her sibling smashing up the car outside and remain seated at the table? Still, I could accept them and believe them. And although the ""gay scene"" at the dining room table has been mercilessly picked apart in the discussion groups, I think it worked. It was clear that SJP's character didn't MEAN to be insulting, yet it also seemed reasonable that the family would be insulted by what she said.Diane Keaton was especially amazing, but that's no surprise. I cried like a faucet at the end, as she watched the snow.

Another actress may have been able to salvage this, but she probably would have needed to bring her favorite writer! Why any of these actors took on this script amazes me. Diane Keaton's character is unbelievable in a sense that I have never met a mother with such lousy character. The ridiculous plot that unfolds doesn't even bother me as much as the premise. From minute one, the SJP character is unlikable...then she encounters a family that is worse! By the time they sit down for Christmas Eve dinner, I am squirming in my seat, only to be topped by the most uncomfortable dialog one could imagine - trite, silly, moronic, painful, pathetic, you name it. Just not plausible or remotely enjoyable. At this point I wished they would all go away, separating themselves from each other forever. Except for Luke Wilson's character, your typical Luke character, he is the only moment of light in the film. Even Claire Danes' character is a clichéd nuisance, but compared to the rest, bearable. They should have re-wrote the entire script after casting and had Luke & Claire run off together away from these lousy people! (Craig T. Nelson can drive).

Slacker brother Ben (Luke Wilson, giving the performance of his career) takes her to bed.

No real person would ever behave this way.4) The climax of the movie is a wonderful ensemble scene, with different people arriving and getting involved in working out their various issues.

204,korodim,I should have listened to people who said 'Don't watch it',1,31 December 2019,"Honestly, this is a very bad movie, probably the worst I have ever seen, although I was prepared that it would be a weak one. I expected some lighthearted fun, with some family drama and stupid conversations. You know the type of movie that goes in the background while you bake your Christmas cookies, but this movie managed to underdo this. So many questions in my head: The synopsis says that Everett's family is eccentric and outgoing. Eccentric means that they smoke pot together? Or that one of sons if deaf and gay? Oh, so outgoing. Other than that the family hates her for the first sight, but no reason is mentioned. Okay she is a weirdo a bit, but they do nothing to welcome her. Also did Everett not prepare her for the visit, what his family would be like? Everett rarely helps her in weird situations, except for being angry with his own family.
Who was some of the people in the family, many were not even introduced. Luke Wilson's character was very shallow too, like when he was standing next to the car in a PJ and his 'joystick' hanging around? Why was this necessary? And why did Meredith give Diane's picture to the family as Christmas present? To me it seems a very personal gift, not something you give to someone who you never met before. I did not get why it was necessary to add Diane Keaton's breast cancer to all of this weird and weak plot. Was this supposed to bring the family together? Honesty, I would have been happier if the whole movie was like the kitchen scene, when Meredith spilled out the breakfast and people fell in the kitchen, seriously this slapstick-like scene was the best in the movie.

I think they portrayed it perfectly.From a person that have been in a dysfunctional family all my life i can say this movie is on point.As for comedy... There is some in this movie, but i think the broader part of this movie is a drama about how some family's just don't function all that well.Some times its refreshing to see a drama where everyone is not perfect, where you see that yes people have issues. For that i think this movie is a great one for that.I have as said watched this many times and i still love it. And hate it cause it reminds me of the dysfunctional family I'm in, but you know what?

Nelson set to Judy Garland's rendition of ""Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas""), but the epilogue that takes place in the last five minutes of the film completely redeems it as a serious piece.Anyone who has lost a parent, especially a mother that loved Christmas, will have a VERY difficult time watching the end of this film. Yet it doesn't bog down into sappy emotion but instead reflects the fact that life continues on. The early cues of Amy as, essentially a young Sybil come full circle at the end as Amy, wearing one of her mother's beloved rings, places her mother's favorite ornament on the family Christmas tree, and shares the film's most heartfelt kiss reflected in a photo taken of Sybil when pregnant with her.",The Family Stone

Worse, within the first 10 minutes they completely telegraph how this movie is going to turn out...So in the end what the viewer gets is a fist full of clichés and no surprises at all...And what the suits have to do is market the movie deceptively enough with the hope of recouping expenses. But what is left is a mess of a movie that only disappoints when it had a chance to inspire...",The Family Stone
212,Oroloro,What film is about....,9,28 November 2005,"This is a sentimental and delightful holiday tale of family....but isn't that exactly what you'd expect from a holiday film? The story hold would hold up even if it weren't set in the holiday period. The story is about a large family gathering at Christmas with secrets revealed and lots of love to go around. What I liked most is how well the ensemble cast works - each character blends wonderfully and is superbly cast; each actor gets a moment to shine...the story moves forward and unfolds well with laughs and tears. Sarah Jessica Parker does a great job creating a nervous quirky character that becomes more at ease with herself - I think it's her best work (I never really like Sex and the City) she is funny, warm and totally inhabits the character, who evolves before our eyes. A fun film and worth seeing. The cast includes Dianne Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Dermot Mulroney, Craig T. Nelson, Luke Wilson and Claire Danes.All do great jobs to this good story.",The Family Stone
213,acerkc,Condoing sibling swaping,1,12 May 2006,"I really don't understand how people could enjoy this crappy mix of comedy and drama. It is clear that the director didn't know what he wanted this movie to be-a comedy, a drama, a family movie. Whatever his/her intent, it failed on all counts. This movie couldn't be more unrealistic. For all you people out there with families, would it be acceptable if your fiancé hooked up with your sister? Or if your fiancé hooked up with your brother? Considering the high rating for this filth, you people at IMDb consider that event to not only be normal but entertaining as well! And what was the unnecessary stuff about the breast cancer? Come on, that had nothing to do with Dylan McDermott's character wanting to marry Sarah Jessice Parker. Most surprising of all, how could all of this good talent agree to do this stupid script? Please explain it to me how they would all choose to do this ridiculous montage of so many different movies. My wife and I rarely turn off a movie before it is over, and we did with this one0mainly because of the stupid acceptable sway of fiances for siblings. If any of you out there think that this movie is in any way realistic, your families are more screwed up than the Stones. Last, the previews did not depict this movie in any way similar to what the movie actually gave us.",The Family Stone
214,velene,movie with heart but without direction,6,25 December 2008,"The Family Stone centers around a Christmas gathering between a conservative businesswoman and her fiancé's liberal, spirited family full of colourful and distinct personalities.Herein lies the first problem which I felt hindered the overall development of the film: the movie, like a bundle of Christmas presents, had a bunch of subplots hingeing on each character but with which were left massively underdeveloped or just plain unnecessary. This made the climax of the film very frustrating for me because, asides from the main crux of the film which was about to undergo a frustrating conclusion, it was also left in the way of various other subplots which I didn't really care about. For e.g. the pregnant sister. I felt that the movie would have been much more enjoyable if they were to enjoin each character more fully into the main plot instead of half-dipping and half-skimming between their own and the main plot involving Sarah Jessica Parker's character and her fiancé.The ensemble of actors, however, do their best in engaging the material.The main plot was also concluded on a very slapdash and convenient manner, with the flurry of characters falling out romantically and falling for another's (which is bound to cause a lot of emotional and moral disagreements)- being VERY conveniently ended with a scene of havoc and mess which is supposed to end it all. Nope, not really.Personally, based on the conclusion of the film, I did not manage to decipher the message the film was trying to put across. Initially I thought that the looming marriage amid Christmas symbolized an acceptance of true human nature and forgiveness through all the facades that we put on. But the end kind of jumbled it all for me because it seemed to take on a whole new meaning which I was confused by? Of course this point is just a personal preference.The movie can also be just one for laughs and not taken seriously of course. It also helps that Sarah Jessica Parker pulls of an extremely likable and sympathetic performance and wholly engaging. Her character, for the most part, is the one that keeps the film's energy going and kudos to her, as well as the coherence for which the other characters committed to the film.",The Family Stone
215,TonyKissCastillo,"Despite Bait and Switch Trailer, STONE Cold Good Cinema!",8,14 February 2016,"***** This Review May Contain MINOR Spoilers! ***** The Previews of The Family Stone seemed to hold out the promise of a genuinely light and thoroughly amusing comedy, perhaps a bit over-the-top, but focused on the cultural differences between a very liberal family, (giving the impression that the parents were, perhaps, ""Hippies"" back in the 60's) and a super-conservative and tightly wound woman, engaged to one of their sons.The problem is that the film showcased in the theatrical trailer plus the marketing campaign launched to promote it, vs. the actual movie you see in the theater have absolutely nothing in common! Unfortunately, previews sole raison d'etre apparently is to get people into the theater. It doesn't seem to matter in the least to these people if the expectation generated by the short is totally out of sync with the experience given by the film.Thusly, it is easy to understand the plethora of reviewers who were livid with these bait and switch tactics! At its core, Family Stone is much more of a serious film that attempts to underscore the importance of cohesive family life, and how family unity can overcome obstacles that initially seem insurmountable, such as sharing and then getting over the pain of the loss of one of their own.The cast is remarkable. Sarah Jessica Parker, Luke Wilson, Dermot Mulroney, Claire Danes, Diane Keaton, Rachel McAdams and Craig T. Nelson. Almost all of them renowned actors, who conform a superb ensemble cast. If you enjoy family dramas with a healthy dose of comic relief, Family Stone is far and away better than most films of its kind 8*STARS....ENJOY/DISFRUTELA!

216,dan_ryan,All Families have baggage,8,20 November 2015,"After reading some of the reviews this film appears to be like Hillary Clinton. Either you love it or you hate it. I certainly don't care for Hillary, but I did enjoy this movie. Never was a big Sarah Jessica Parker fan but thought her portrayal was top notch. Diane Keaton was good as always. Craig T Nelson also gave a good performance. Claire Danes has a somewhat minor part. Rachel McAdams is delightfully catty. Had never heard of the protagonist, Dermot Mulroney prior to watching this. Much of the plot is not especially believable but for goodness sake it's a movie. Is there no such thing in love at first sight in Hollywood? Having some dysfunctional aspects in both sides of my family made this enjoyable to watch. If you're Ward and June Cleaver you might not enjoy this film.",The Family Stone
217,mhags33,thought the movie was very flawed...,4,1 January 2006,"I thought this movie was pretty crappy and filled with inconsistent story lines and was pretty awful. Aside from some of Luke Wilsons lines and scenes, and an attempt to be a heartwarming story, i thought it was pretty crappy. Here is what i had problems with...1. The family, for no reason, hated Sarah Jessica Parkers character off the bat. the sister was the only one who met her to that point, and she apparently hated her then too. kinda strange to hate someone you never met so much.2. Luke Wilson was stalking her from the beginning of the movie...most brothers wouldn't really pursue a brothers soon to be fiancée. he might say she was hot (i think she looks like a witch), but it was odd to see him go after her like he did. although he was funny at times and the only character i liked in the movie.3. This isn't a knock on gays, so don't get all offended. But, the gay brother even told him not to marry her...out of all the people who should be sympathetic and supportive of his situation would be the gay brother. Who is he to judge who his brother is going to marry, when his brother has accepted him and his lifestyle without question. that was very inconsistent...if that followed any logic, he would have been the one to support him.4. The sister comes to town, and they all love her right away for no reason, and then when SJP leaves upset, she doesn't go after her. She sits there, with a family she just met, basically strangers, and doesn't chase her sister to console her. She is sitting there playing with the baby in a room full of strangers that HATE her sister...that was very odd too..5. the main guy was going to marry SJP, and out of nowhere, he decides on a whim that he wants to bang her sister. for being so convinced the whole movie that he wanted SJP, he takes quite the 360 the other way a little too easily if you ask me. one conversation while looking for his almost fiancée, and he changes his mind. stupid.6. that scene where he is walking back past the statue after the bus leaves...he arrived there in a car his dad drove, then all of a sudden the car was gone and was walking home in the cold..that was pretty dumb too...the movie tried to be heartwarming and sweet, but was just pretty inconsistent between funny lines from Luke Wilson. some of the awkward moments were kind of funny, but overall, i thought it was a poopy movie. i don't even go to movies and analyze them much, but there were so many easily flawed moments, that even i picked them out. I'm glad the movie was free for us or i would have been pretty upset if i had to pay $17 for that...",The Family Stone
218,menabar89,unexpected Movie,7,8 January 2006,"This movie captured the essence of family value and what its like around the holidays. The movie was based on good events and the characters handled them well. For example, there were times where your eyes would tear up, then moments where everything was just a big joke and you couldn't stop laughing. It was all fun but had a serious twist to it. It also captured how much family is really about. The story was good because of the family portrayed. They were a wacky family who loved each other very deeply. i would recommend it because it was a good moral to the story. Also it taught what it is to be yourself and let go for once just to be carefree.",The Family Stone
219,csabarish,Flawed piece of movie-making with some inspired performances,6,18 April 2006,"Let me start by stating what according to me makes this film good. Brilliantly played characters. I am using the term characters because these are not a bunch of convenient stereotypical roles clubbed into a formula. Each character has its likable and unlikeable traits which makes them seem real. The uptight girlfriend is not mean, she is just what she is. The mother is doing what she thinks is right. Father is just trying to be right. All the actors play true to their characters and are worthy of praise. Kudos though must go to SJP and Diane Keaton. These actresses do need to prove anything to anyone about their acting prowess, but the fearlessness with which they tackle their roles is mesmerizing to watch. It was so easy to go over the top and miss it. But not these experts. And yet the film somehow does not seem right. It took me two days to realize why. At first i thought the awkwardness was because of what i had expected it to be. The promos suggested it to be a typical family comedy. Well the family part is correct but comedy... i am not so sure. I think the director did not want it to be a comedy but something warmer. Yet he did not want to turn it into a weepie. This may be the films undoing. But according to me it is the absence of a central character that is troubling. At first you think it is Meredith... but hey is it not Sybil? Or is it about how their relationship grows? If one of the characters had narrated the story it would have been better. But that is my opinion. And of course no one can deny the fact that the film is heartwarming and entertaining. To put it simply, well worth watching.",The Family Stone
220,dizzjay,Unfocused Mess,1,19 May 2007,"This film has an abundance of acting talent. I thought Sarah Jessica Parker was brilliant as the uptight Meredith. But that abundance actually translates into too much. This film didn't know what it was about and tries to deal with so many issues that the characterizations that drive the story are lost.Basically, the favorite son brings his inappropriate fiancé to meet his family for Christmas. There are two important relationships developed in the film, between Dermot Mulroney and Claire Danes (his fiancé's sister) and between Sarah Jessica Parker and Luke Wilson (Mulroney's brother and his brother's fiancé). Clare Danes gets one scene in which she tells a long story about a totem pole in Alaska to show Mulroney falling in love with her. Sarah Jessica Parker gets one scene to change from a tense, insecure career-woman into Luke Wilson's relaxed party girl. It not enough and the relationships are therefore unconvincing.Mixed in with the change of partners scenario is a mother dying of breast cancer who deflects emotional moments with inappropriate laughter and talks about the man who popped her daughter's cherry. There is another son who is deaf, gay, in an inter-racial relationship, and is adopting a child. There's a daughter pining for the guy who popped her cherry. There's also Elizabeth Reaser as a pregnant daughter who really has no place in the movie at all; she could have been left on the cutting room floor and no one would have noticed (her performance was excellent, just not necessary in an already crowded cast).The editors did their best to pull all this nonsense into a coherent story, but ended up truncating the important parts and leaving us with an unfocused mess.",The Family Stone
221,TheTimeLady,"I laughed and I cried, and I enjoyed it.",10,4 April 2009,"One point I laughed too much. And it wasn't meant to be funny. The bit after Meredith (the bighead) 'insults' Sybil (the left thinker) by saying 'The world is hard enough, and you wouldn't wish that your children would be gay', or something like that, and Sybil flips, Kelly says 'Sybil,'and Sybil says 'Don't Sybil me,', I literally rolled on the floor with laughter. I have no idea why I find it so funny, every time I watch it, I have to rewind it and watch it again! I enjoyed The Family Stone as it had my favourite actress in it and had a good plot. With the legdendary Diane Keaton as fiery matriarch Sybil, Rachel McAdams as youngest daughter Amy and Dermot Mulroney as eldest Everett, I loved every minute of it. The only three people I found annoying were Sarah Jessica Parker, Claire Danes and Craig T Nelson. They really annoyed me and I don't know why. I think it might be because every one else seemed to be a bit different to a normal family, because Meredith (SJP) is just like my brother's girlfriend and Kelly (Craig T Nelson) is almost the same as my cousin's dad.

The situational family humor was there, albeit somewhat trite and predictable as the story unraveled. But the movie lost us quickly by the comprehensive use of politically correct characters in a plot that made sure to present amorality as normal and acceptable in a Christmas family setting, while offering samples of rudeness, crudeness, lack of values and poor judgment as the way to solve interpersonal problems of one kind or another.

225,sj1840,"Touching, Funny Comedy-Drama About The Ties That Bind",10,24 July 2006,"""The Family Stone"" is one of my favorite movies-a touching, funny comedy-drama about family, love, and acceptance. The film is not afraid to be unique and original as it mines the complexities of family togetherness and the petty resentments that emerge among tight-knit adult siblings, their parents, and the ""outsider"", the oldest son's chilly, uptight girlfriend, played in an inspired, award-nominated performance by Sarah Jessica Parker. Her struggle to gain the acceptance and respect of the family Stone provides the setup for the story in which she, the Stone parents(the wonderful Diane Keaton as the outspoken mother and Craig T. Nelson as the quiet, compassionate father),and their five adult children (Dermot Mulroney, Luke Wilson, Rachel Mc Adams, Ty Giordano, and Elizabeth Reaser)spend three eventful days together over Christmastime. In these three days, characters grow, bonds are reaffirmed, and secrets are revealed as Meredith and the Stones learn some powerful lessons about forgiveness and the healing power of love.The ""Family Stone"" is by turns both hilarious and achingly poignant, both because of its pitch perfect observations of family dynamics. Parker's performance is the true standout, but there is not a weak link in the entire cast, with Keaton having one particularly powerful moment when affirming her love and acceptance to her gay son.""The Family Stone"" is a rare find amidst the mindless eye candy that characterizes most studio films these days. It is a film unafraid to show adults loving together, growing together, and standing with each other in times of sorrow and joy.",The Family Stone

However, I enjoyed everything else, most of all the Direction. I really appreciated the way he gave us the information on the characters, it wasn't being spouted off in excess dialogue, it was being shown and hinted to in conversations so that your mind and imagination could do the rest.

The focus of the movie is on Meredith who is about to meet her boyfriend's family. The film follows the antics that Meredith suffers whilst trying to survive the visit. pretty much like any other m-t-p movie.But it offers more, the characters of the family members are well defined as a whole. The relations of the family are so well expressed that the movie is as much about 'the family stone' as it is a meet-the-parents movie for Meredith.The discussions are real topics and the actions and reactions, while not always applaud-able, are just as real.The situations border outrageous but still believable all up to the end which ends in a typical Hollywood fashion that's why i gave it an eight (but other than that, this film is perfect.)",The Family Stone
229,ddagg2,Ignore the plot and focus on the message,7,26 December 2005,"I left the theater after seeing The Family Stone mildly entertained but more disappointed than anything else. I had high expectations based on the cast and what I had read about the film prior to its' release. Why then the disappointment? The cast was great (Keaton magnificent, Parker, Wilson and McAdams funny, Mulroney gorgeous) and I did laugh and was moved. The problem was with the construct. Specifically. too many balls being juggled to the detriment of the film as a whole and(as mentioned frequently)a hackneyed plot.However, after getting home and thinking about the film and why it failed to live up to my expectations, my opinion changed for the better. Yes, the plot is convoluted, but I don't think that is the point of the film. The story is simply a device (in this instance a contrivance) to speak to the issue of family. That is ultimately what this film is about, not who winds up with who, or who has what disease; but the role family plays in our lives.Bezucha is asking us to look at the family dynamic and how it can be both empowering and restrictive. This family is dealing with a huge problem and it is closing ranks. trying to preserve the dynamic in the face of imminent change. How people react in this situation is what the film is speaking to.As a member of a large family, not unlike the Stones, I think the filmmaker got it right.

234,Rocky-UK,Unstable Bizarre Christmas Offering,3,11 December 2005,"The Family Stone is this year's latest Christmas Themed offering. Sarah Jessica Parker has left her Manolo Blahniks behind to become the detached and icy Meredith who goes to visit her boyfriend Everetts (Dermot Mulroney) family for the first time over the Christmas holidays. The film begins as a typical family comedy situation with great potential, unfolding similar to the National Lampoon series but it then transforms into something rather more bizarre.The only member of the family to have previously met Meredith is younger sister Amy (Rachel McAdams) and the event was painful enough for her to plant the seeds of hatred into the rest of the family which compromises of hippie parents Sybil and Kelly (Diane Keaton and Craig T. Nelson), older sister Susannah (Elizabeth Reaser), brother Thad (Tyrone Giordano), his boyfriend Patrick (Brian White) and younger brother Ben (Luke Wilson). The family's frosty reception becomes too much for Meredith so she sends for her sister Julie (Claire Danes). As Julie joins the family, it appears to be love and first sight between Julie and Everett. Over dinner that evening, Meredith becomes confused by Sybil's statement that she wished for gay children and her comments come across as both racist and homophobic so she is ousted from the table and the family itself as Everett finally turns on her. The event is very tense and highlights problems within American society. Meredith runs from the house with only the younger brother, Ben following. He takes her away from the situation to the sanctuary of the local bar where they strike an honest bond. Meanwhile Everett and Julie have decided that they should go and look for their beloved but they meander around town like it's their first date and seem to fall in love. Hang on a minute we thought Everett loved Meredith and wanted to marry her. What's going on? The bond between the two sisters was never established so this leaves us feeling very uneasy about the new union.The film seems to really loose the plot, literally. We never find out why Meredith is the way she is and doesn't seem capable of emotional bonding. The subplot of the mother's cancer is cringe worthy as this is marketed as a Romantic Comedy - Christmas - Family film. In the end normal order is resumed with the pairing of more equal matches but I ask you would you really pair up with your sister's ex-boyfriend or ex-boyfriends brother? I think not.Save your money and go and rent out Love Actually, a far superior film.",The Family Stone
235,alma_halliwell,Could have been nice but ....,6,1 May 2018,I watched it twice. First time I don't quite remember and I think it did not leave any special impression on me. However the second time I could have liked it but I just cannot go over the idea that brothers 'switched' girlfriends. It is so sick. In the beginning I sympathized with Parker's character. I thought his brother was just being nice towards her and their night out at the bar was just an innocent attempt to relax her and take a bit of burden off of her back. However what was happening simultaneously with Everrett and Julie didn't make sense at all. I am very into romantic movies and I mostly like movies that people give bad ratings. But this one I must agree with majority. First of all I don't get it why they liked each other. That was apparently firs time for them to meet so it makes so little sense they fell immediately. On top of that Julie came as a support for her sister and she clearly stole her boyfriend. Basically sick and wrong. The reason I gave it 6 stars is the family gathering and holiday spirit. All in all I wouldn't recommend it since there are much better romantic movies.,The Family Stone
236,sarmoti_tiger,Horrible film about horrible people,1,7 April 2006,"Everett (Mulroney) takes his ""uptight"" city girlfriend Meredith (SJP) home to meet his family for Christmas. His family turns out to be the biggest bunch of fake, hypocritical, horrible and judgemental people you'll ever meet and have decided, even without meeting Meredith, that she's unworthy of any hospitality.Let's think - boyfriend brings you home to meet the family  anyone would feel nervous. However, when Meredith greets the family in a slightly shaky voice, it is only further proof that she's not ""free-spirited"" enough to join their happy clan in the hills. I'm not sure why exactly the family did not like her but I THINK it may have something to do with the fact that she was super polite and tried to be respectful. I mean, no doubt, the family would have accepted her in a sec if she pranced through the door, ripped her clothes off and asked them to join her around the fire to smoke pot.The horrible sister Amy (McAdams) says she hates Meredith because Meredith once took her to a nice restaurant and she also likes to clear her throat. Let's remind Meredith to bring Amy to a back alley for dinner next time and keep the phlegm gargled at the back of her mouth. The mother (Keaton) joins in the fun as is also, horrible; Ben (Wilson), the hippie brother falls for Meredith at first sight (so we can assume that his love for her is shallow and only physical) and starts hitting on her despite the fact that she's his brother's girlfriend. Etc.There's also the gay deaf brother who has a black boyfriend. This very brother tells Everett straight on ""please don't marry her (Meredith)"" although he has known the girl for less than 24 hours. You'd think he'd understand the importance of being supportive and non-judgementalMeredith eventually calls her sister Julie (Danes) in for help. Julie is the opposite of Meredith - she's free spirited and is probably the president of the ""save the whales while climbing Mount Kilimanjaro"" club (She falls off the bus and she doesn't even care!!). Everett falls for her at first sight (so again, we assume this is only physical because he knows nothing about her). Way to go Everett, fall for your girlfriend's sister on the day you plan to propose to her!! Immediately, the family flocks to Julie like flies to a carcass while Meredith is helping with dinner and is lonerised in the corner. At the dinner table (and this is the scene which made me so upset for Meredith that I ACTUALLY cried), Julie asks the gay brother questions about what race he wants his adopted child to be (since he's in an interracial relationship). Julie touches on the issue of race and everyone smiles, giving it the ""that's a very good profound question"" nod. Then Meredith brings up the topic of homosexuality, asking if he thinks it's going to affect the child. OK, maybe she didn't phrase it well but it was obvious she was NOT being a homophobe (If she WAS homophobic, would she be eating dinner with 2 gay men AND spend the entire afternoon with the gay black guy in the kitchen??). Meredith is surprised by the fact that the mother says she ""wished all 3 of her children would be gay"" and the family immediately labels her as the disgusting narrow-minded a-hole (yes and the father even yells at Meredith). Funny that, When Julie asks, the family sees her as being ""curious and interested"" but when Meredith asks, she's ""offensive and rude"".Naturally, Meredith runs out in tears. Ben runs after her while the BOYFRIEND just sits there. Julie doesn't look too bothered either and instead of seriously looking for her, the two end up having a pleasant little walk in the snow, talking about their dreams and goals. It's disparing that Ben, the brother who's known Meredith for only a couple of days seems to be more concerned about her well-being than her own boyfriend and sister. Everett even has the audacity to ask Julie if she wants to ""go get a coffee"" while Meredith is still missing!!! Meredith spends time with Ben, get a coupla beers and suddenly turns ""free-spirited"" (she lets her hair down!! REBEL!) Then we know what happens, they end up in the same room (though they don't sleep together) and Everett realizes he loves Julie. Everett tries to get Julie to try on the wedding ring he intended to give Meredith. When Julie kinda refuses, he almost forces it onto her finger...romantic. I find it even more disturbing though, that as a sister, Julie didn't go up to Meredith and say something like ""dude, your boyfriend is totally hitting on me"". Instead, she starts to feel that she also loves this strange man that she's just met the day before (though there is no indication of any type of relationship development between the two. Finally, everyone confronts everyone and then follows the typical, everyone starts fighting, they all fall down and start laughing out loud together and then it seems that all the meaness from before is forgotten and everyone becomes best friends forever.Meredith ends up with Ben and Everett the a-hole ends up with Julie the a-hole. Meredith seems to be TOTALLY OK with that and neither the sister or Everett seems to feel bad at all (note, the two began flirting with each other while Meredith was still going out with Everett). Who cares, Meredith will have the joy of telling her nephews and nieces ""I, your auntie, slept with your father"".And inbetween all of this, we find out the mother has breast cancer. So there's a lot of crying from the family, then a lot of meaness, then a lot of crying, then a lot of, you get the idea. I'm still confused as to how the cancer bit fits with the ""romantic comedy""",The Family Stone

238,ijeomas,I can't believe I watched this again...,1,1 January 2021,"...and to the end, SMH! When my younger sister asked for a good movie to watch, my older sister recommended The Family Stone. I begged to differ. My sister convinced me this was a good movie, so I decided, why not. Well, as the saying goes, always follow your first mind. I wasted 104 minutes of my life that I cannot get back.This movie in summary and simply put is... guy brings is stiff executive girlfriend home for the holidays to be insulted, mistreated, degraded, and humiliated by his dysfunctional family. He barely defends her, she stays despite the foolishness; however, calls her sister to come to her aide. Boyfriend professes his love for girlfriend in hopes to get grandma's ring to propose, mom refuses his request. A few hours later, boyfriend picks up girlfriend's sister from bus station and immediately falls in love with her.
Fast forward >>>> boyfriend trades girlfriend for her sister and his brother takes girlfriend as his new love interest. So, basically stiff girlfriend is not good enough for one brother but magically perfect for the other. Unrealistic, unbelievable, and downright a waste of time. The movie had no purpose other than to murder 104 minutes of my life, again.",The Family Stone
239,ndrapela,"Homosexual Heaven, but movie-goer Hell",1,9 August 2006,"Clearly conceived, born, and bred in Hollywood (the bubble-insulated, self-focused, freak capital of the world) this movie is based upon the profound issues of the liberal, Los Angeles psyche...those that of course have nothing to do with reality.But there are plenty of other of reasons to pan this dung heap...1. You could see where the script writer was trying to go, but each scene was so transparently contrived that it was distracting. I'm guessing the script writer was about 19 years old, or at least had that maturity level. It is unrealistic, childish, and painfully predictable. After 10 minutes, you know where it is going and how it will end.2. However, the story actually looked good next to the directing, which was I would say completely AWOL. The movie had over-ample references to smoking weed, and I'm sure that's what this director was doing before, after, and during each take. The movie was a sequence of disjointed clips with no continuity which made it feel awkward as a whole. Scenes which were evidently meant to be poignant came off as pathetic and staged. And speaking of staged, the blocking must have been worked out by the same people who did ""Gunsmoke"".3. The damn movie just made no sense in that there seemed to be inside jokes between the characters that the audience was not privy to. The viewer just sits there and wonders what the heck each reference or side look is supposed to mean. It didn't help that none of the characters was developed, believable, or had any depth.4. Since there is one (1) deaf character in the movie, the entire cast is required to sign out everything they say for the whole movie in sign language. Not only is this political correctness gone mad, but it is extremely irritating and distracting to have to watch this the entire movie!5. Have you ever been in the middle of a movie or play and suddenly felt that you are the object of an obvious propaganda attempt at social change? When this happens to me, I find myself feeling resentful and pushing back the other way. This is what this movie does. So not only was I disappointed with the movie, I was disgusted. In this movie, heterosexual = evil. We of course have the requisite, token, gay characters (who are always the heroes in these movies). But this movie goes a step farther and makes each gay somehow ""disadvantaged"" in order to win audience sympathy: Black, deaf, it is really pathetic. Also, these gay characters are (unlike any normal couple in the movies or real life) constantly locked in a permanent embrace wherever they appear in the movie so as to somehow say, ""WE'RE HERE, AND WE'RE QUEER!"" Okay, we understand that they are gay characters. Let's move on, folks.Really the only semi-bright spot in the entire movie was the acting of Sarah Jessica Parker. And for me to say that means a lot. But she was so convincing as the bony, neurotic wreck of a woman that it conjured up an emotional reaction to her character. Isn't this the goal of acting? Of course, as the lone heterosexual in the movie who considered homosexuality to be of questionable normalcy, she was the object of all scorn and the source of all the problems in the story. The scriptwriter had her expressing thoughts that only exist in the paranoid, guilty mind of a closet homosexual, and seemed to create a red herring of a person to beat upon savagely.One could go on about the fabricated family characters who exist only in the dreams of a gay-rights activist, but the point is hopefully already made. Wrap it up with the quintessential ""Home Alone""-style buffoonery, complete with Nutcracker music, and you have the ultimate viewer-repellent, loser movie.At least one could close their eyes and listen to Tchaikovsky.",The Family Stone
240,Alissa-10,Great Cast; Atrocious Script,3,3 January 2006,"Perhaps the greatest problem with the movie is the fact that it has such a great cast. The movie tries to include everyone as a major character and fails by making no one a character.No character really has a story. The writers through a script together, and expected the audience to connect dots that aren't there. Not one character is developed. Supposedly they all have a story. It is a pity, however, that the audience only gets a brief glimpse at it.In my opinion, they tried to do too much and ended up doing not enough as a result. None of the actors really got a chance to shine. Rachel McAdams seem to be the only one who pulled off a good performance despite the script and the limitations of screen time.You leave the movie theatre asking why. Why was he meant to be with her? Why did they not work out? Why did they work out? These questions are never answered. I suppose the writers counted on an audience that does not question or think for that matter.",The Family Stone
241,emnizzle_18,I kinda want my money back...,5,31 July 2006,"Okay so, there's a gay deaf brother with a black boyfriend, a dad who smokes pot with his middle aged son, a mother with breast cancer, another son with an annoying fiancé (I don't like Sarah Jessica Parker- this role certainly doesn't help her at all), and a daughter who doesn't do much of anything and they all get together for Christmas.This is supposed to be funny? All they needed was an abortion story and they would practically have an ad for Democrats.I have no problem with a liberal philosophy, but the way the issues were addressed in this movie was just rather irritating and awkward. The premise of the movie being a comedy seemed like just an excuse to try to draw some more people into the theaters. The romance was also extremely thin and I didn't really care about it (also exceedingly predictable).The flimsy excuse for a plot causes the movie to drag from one awkward situation to another with nothing to really captivate a viewer (except McAdams who, as always, does a great job with what she has). The film seems like an excuse to try to push the envelope with issues, but the issues are presented in such a way that seems like ""think liberal, or you hate everyone."" This disengaged me from the movie, and I was thankful for the ending credits.",The Family Stone
242,polner,"Enjoyed this film, despite flaws and wrong marketing angle",9,31 December 2005,"I really enjoyed watching this film. It was bittersweet but definitely thought-provoking and engaging at the same time.The bulk of the negative reviews seem to come from people who thought they were in for a comedy but felt cheated out of that. I did go into the theater thinking it was a comedy but I wasn't that fixed in my expectations. I also don't understand the comments about the family being 'portrayed' in such and such a way and how the actions of the family member don't agree with that portrayal. When I watch movies I pretend to be the invisible observer...no one portrays anything to me other than what I see and interpret on my own. And I thought the family was quirky and plausible, which made it very entertaining for me to watch them 'in action' so to speak.For me, ""The Family Stone"" was more of a snapshot of how a family spent Christmas and allows the viewers to leave with whatever interpretation they want.",The Family Stone

Real, interesting characters you'd want to know, maybe sometimes want to choke, but still can't resist. I didn't think the writer could pull this off so well (i.e., the relationship switch), but he did. Fantastic dialogue, original and memorable. Sarah Jessica Parker had no problem leaving ""Sex and the City""'s Carrie in the closet to play this new role and Diane Keaton didn't disappoint either. In fact, nearly everyone in the movie brought it home. Not a slow scene in the bunch and a fresh twist on the dysfunctional family brought together by the holidays. Definitely not just a chick flick, but something for everyone. I think most will embrace this movie, especially during the holidays.",The Family Stone
245,loracbau,Loved it! Terrific,9,28 August 2006,"This is a gem. I loved it. Another 'new' Christmas classic, it's a story about a family, all their interweaving stories, as individuals and as a family. It's about acceptance, love, forgiveness, how to stay a family despite difficulties, how to face reality, truth. It's about family. I wish I had a family like this, yet the characters were not perfect, nor is the family. If you are bigoted you may not like it, but one of the sons is gay, but that is not a major theme. The theme is family, and love. Because the family stone is its heart - the heart within each member of any family. Even though all the 'children' are grown, they still need their parents, and need their family, even if they only get together as a full family at Christmas. Basically it challenges the audience to think about how you handle the differences within a family. How do you accept these differences? How do you stay a family.Great acting, just wonderful.",The Family Stone
246,mmeltzer-1,a family sizzles with varying degrees of passion over an array of well set up discoveries,9,29 December 2005,"Lot's of eye candy here. Beautifully composed shots. I always like it when an artistic director can avoid catching high key fever and not slap together a nauseatingly distracting palette.Anyway. The reveals were so well set up and delivered, I got multiple laughs along the way at least a few times. I remember thinking the writer must have remembered reading Aristotle's Poetics in weaving the story together.The actor's delivered! It could be a 10, but I got so caught up in the opening camera movement it spun my mind to wa-ondering well into the kitchen. It felt like a nice mini narrative, but like I said, my mind skidded off elsewhere. So, I was not prepared for Sarah's character's Mulroney's reveal. She played that character with such richness. I never saw ""Sex in the City"", nor am I inclined to, but that body of work must have come in handy in fashioning the performance. I am not saying that the other actor's did not deliver rich performances (I cried at both ends of the spectrum.), but she took me for a wild mouse amusement parkeride! I have to say that Luke's character's dream was, if not a transcript of a real one, carefully and intelligently constructed with more than a little understanding of Freudian psychology.This is one jam packed film. It's tight. Tom Bazooka! You da man.PS I saw 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" the other day and, there's one scene with Kate and Spence duking (dooking?) it out to a classical music score that Spence reveals is playing on the family stereo when it suddenly stops as he removes the record. I mention this only in wondering if this movie might did not have some opportunities for that kind of nuance.",The Family Stone
247,car-24,Liked it,8,5 December 2005,"I don't normally enjoy romantic comedy ""chick flicks"" but I saw this one recently and liked it. It's like you took a syrupy romcom and added a little grit and smut to keep the male audience members interested. I usually despise Sara Jessica Parker, but liked her in this movie, because she plays an annoying bitch and I suppose the director just told her to ""act naturally"". One niggle -- I think the film asks some questions which it forgets to answer. For example, SJP says some supposedly bigoted things at the table (or perhaps, one could argue the family was too touchy) but we never find out if she cares one way or the other about the deaf gay son and his black boyfriend.For that matter, you could argue that Ben Stone falls in love with Meridith's sister Julie a little too easily. The blunt instrument of the mother (brilliantly played by Diane Keaton, someone else I normally don't like) telling her husband that their son doesn't really know what he wants is meant to foreshadow Ben's change of heart, but that didn't really work for me.This is writer/director Bezucha's first major work, and he's young, so I suspect his future work will be tighter and more believable.",The Family Stone

249,jelad612-1,Uneven and unfocused,7,10 May 2021,"I have seen this film a couple of times over the years, and I really wanted to like it because of the talented cast. In the end, though, this movie falls flat because it can't really decide what kind of film it wants to be: is it a heartwarming Christmas film? A slapstick comedy? A serious social commentary? It tries to be all of these things and misses the mark on them all.The cast is large, and for that reason we don't get to know all of the characters well. Claire Danes and Sarah Jessica Parker are not believable as sisters. They don't really share any scenes where they connect at all, and they seem more like two strangers. The Stone siblings fare better in that department, although the older daughter really isn't developed as a character at all, and the younger daughter is mean with no motivation.The biggest flaw for me, though, is with Dermot Mulroney's character Everett. He and Parker don't have much chemistry together, and you never really know how he feels about Meredith. He seems to spend most of the movie either miffed or pissed off at her, and he falls for her sister WAY too fast. There's a sense that he is only proposing to Meredith to show his mother that he's not going to be alone after her death, but the film never really makes that clear.There ARE some good individual scenes and some good acting, but overall the film leaves one cold.",The Family Stone

253,jimroman,Not a Christmas classic,5,5 November 2005,"""The Family Stone"" delivers some huge laughs, all the more fulfilling because they're grounded in some dark back-stories. All cast members sparkle; their performances surpass the material they must deliver. Slow to start, ""The Family Stone"" is overwrought. It's a film that might have been better had the screenwriter Thomas Bezucha not directed it too. He's saddled Sarah Jessica Parker with an impossible role. It's great to see her tackle this unfamiliar character, but another director might have encouraged a more believable and humorous performance from her pivotal role as the chief antagonist. Putting the heavy-handed farce elements together, the audience remains three-steps ahead of the characters on screen, though that doesn't detract from their entertainment value. Once everybody's assembled for Christmas in Connecticut, this cast has a ball. As straight-man Dylan Mulroney's slacker-brother, this is the best work Luke Wilson ever put on film. Rachel McAdams is a joy as the sister with a reason to be peeved, Craig T. Nelson is a revelation as the gentle patriarch, and Diane Keaton continually surprises. Claire Danes brings great charm to the film's least-developed character. The remainder of the cast sparkles just as brightly, with some charming surprises. But the film is charming to the point of cloying, right down to the sappy soundtrack, overwrought with harps and strings. Although Bezucha's written obvious archetypes, the diverse gathering he assembles at the Christmas table makes a welcome display of new-fangled family values. As the director, it's unfortunate that he's compelled to dwell on the mawkish elements of his story when a lighter hand might have given us a delicate Christmas charmer. With its mood-swings from bathos to farce, audiences won't make ""The Family Stone"" an annual Christmas ritual.",The Family Stone

But as I watched I found myself being disheartened again by Hollywood moguls using my money to promote homosexual lifestyles. Without warning, the movie pretended that homosexuality is a normal and acceptable lifestyle. Moreover, the movie promotes that it is acceptable for homosexual couples to adopt children. Since there was no hint of this in movie previews, I must categorize this film as another Hollywood propaganda piece - and the underlying motivation for presenting it to the American public.This as well as a few other lame plot developments - such as Sarah Jessica Parker getting snockered to lose her inhibitions - left the movie seriously wanting.There were some good scenes. Though the issue at the dinner table was ""Why would anyone wish their child to turn out homosexual, given all the hardships they would endure?"", the scene was realistically acted out.Because I paid money to see a non-controversial and light-hearted film, I feel cheated.

To me this film just played off my many stereotypes of families and the constant changing family dynamic. One thing that keeps puzzling me is the character of Ted the gay son who is deaf, is dating a gay African American. How in the world did this ""gay"" ""black man"" so easily assimilate into this crappy family dynamic when they all have been so horrid to Meredith ""Sarah Jessica Parker"". Then start swapping and one night makes everyone fall in love with someone else....

When she finally lets loose, she ends up confiding in her boyfriends brother instead of boyfriend! it made no sense regarding to why Emmett put the ring on Meridith's sister Julie's hand. they only met that day! how could they be in love? and then at the end , all u see is Emmett and Julie walking in together. nothing special.THIS WAS A DEPRESSING TEARJERKER. i was not impressed!PERSON #2: I liked the movie. While it wasn't funny, it was poignant and the focus of Merdith trying to fit in really showed us the main story of how the family was reacting to different things going on in their lives, and took it out on her. Like Amy and her ex boyfriend, and Luke Wilson's character being an oddball. It really showed a different side to each of the actors talents and I thought it was very refreshing. The movie won't be a classic and could even be considered forgettable, but if you want a melancholy movie to really make you appreciate your family then go see this.

261,JeeezyPetes,Awful writing... decent acting,1,14 July 2012,"Knowing fully well this review will probably never be read I still feel the need to say something about this movie. It took me a long time to figure out why it had such a high rating and the only solution I can come up with is it's star studded cast and the actors actually do a spot on job of portraying people with absolutely no human qualities. If you're reading this you've probably already been bombarded by the horrible themes in this movie but just in case you somehow missed the page after page of bad reviews I'll fill you in.1) The entire family is atrocious flat out. They have no redeeming qualities, they're bigoted, narrow-minded and selfish.2) The movie paints a horrible picture of liberals. I have to assume the screenwriter decided to take the old cliché where the free-spirited girl goes to meet her boyfriend's conservative parents, 180 it and probably believed he was God's gift to man when he did it. What he failed to realize was that people do not dislike the old conservative family because they're conservative, they dislike the family because they're bigots.3) The characters are unrealistic and all relationships they have with one another are not well established. I found myself asking a hundred times who is Everett? Why doesn't Parker just leave? How can a family call itself functional when they slip further and further into a sea of immorality? 4) Danes and Mulroney drift through this movie. They have by far the most useless and underdeveloped characters ever.5) This movie is sickly incestuous and clearly proves the screenwriter knows absolutely nothing about love or even what an actual relationship looks like.6) Toward the very end of this movie the screenwriter seemed to realize that the monsters he created were in fact monsters and decided to give them an out. Keaton's character's excuse for being an absolute troll throughout the movie was by far the weakest and least believable of them all. I'll spare you the spoiler and just say the only way her excuse for being so horrible to Parker in the movie would have worked was if she literally had ESP.7) The movie also touches on the issues of race and homosexuality and once again is way off the mark. The general belief appears to be that unless you cover your ears and scream blah blah blah and pretend that people aren't different you're a bigot. Furthermore anyone who actually has an iota of sense and acknowledges that being gay is more difficult than being heterosexual must also be a bigot. Apparently no one brought up that pretending the world is colorblind is just replacing ignorance with more ignorance.8) The saddest thing was the screenwriter could have easily revived the film if he had just for a second had the characters learn from their mistakes. Instead the moral seems to be that when a group of people bully you for being different you are supposed to conform.Most of the acting however is spot on excluding one or two exceptions. Parker touches our hearts, McAdams is an absolute witch, etc. However due to the awful screen writing I can't give this movie anything better than a 1. I apologize to the actors who actually gave something to this movie, but really you guys should have known this was going to be a flop.",The Family Stone

After we left the movie, we tried to make sense of the character development and the storyline. It really is a shame because with some script rework, a new director, a little recasting, this could have been a masterpiece.",The Family Stone
265,ng_juan_hann,Only for the weak,2,9 January 2006,"It was a horrendous attempt at making an emotional movie. All star cast, but bad lines, bad acting, improbable storyline, unlikeable characters, and what do you get? The family Stone. Sarah Jessica Parker's role was so completely OTT, and the family so 'nice' that it was almost laughable. Mama Stone having cancer had nothing to do with anything except to induce a few tears from those who have reverse valves on their tear ducts. Dermot whoever was literally the worst actor there besides Sarah. He's like Keanu Reeves with Botox injections: completely expressionless. Nothing in the movie makes sense. The reverse pairing-up of Claire Danes and Sarah could be seen a mile off, and it was complete cr*p anyway. No memorable lines. No GOOD lines. No lines at all in fact. Just consists of Sarah making a fool out of herself, Dermot trying to look macho (and failing) and everyone else giving her a hard time. And the ending, the tearjerker: Mama wasn't there anymore. I'd find it easier to cry at Bush's funeral than shed a tear for this lump of rock.Don't waste your time. Rachel McAdams is the only reason I'd watch this stinker.",The Family Stone

Another thing that upset me and ruined me a feeling of Christmas and New Year's magic is the connection between Everett and Julie. Like ... what that ???? From this movie one may conclude Meredith loved Everett. She would not trying so hard in this desperate family if she didn't love him.

267,d_onei,"Some touching moments, but they tried too hard overall",2,20 August 2006,"I found this script to be predictable, the characters unbelievable, and the plot tedious.1. It seems like they tried to find every liberal stereotype, and put them into one family. The college professor,neurotic mother, recreational drug user/film critic, the gay son, the young activist. I just felt like they tried too hard to create a liberal family and overdid it.2. Where did Dermott Mulrooney's character fit into this family? He seemed to be the conservative one of the group.3.Sarah Jessica Parker's character was decent by concept, but they did seem to explore the character very well. Why would a woman who is so uptight that she won't even sleep in the same bed as her boyfriend in his parents, make the comments about homosexuality that she did. The whole scene was hard to understand, and a self conscious person like her would not have said anything about it. The whole scene seemed like a director with an agenda.4. For the life of me, I could not figure out why they disliked her to begin with. It seemed they were awfully judgemental about her; from the moment she walked in the door.5.The love rectangle ruined any credibility this movie had, and turned it into a bad soap opera.The mother having cancer angle I did get, but its pertinence to the story was not executed well. My mother is a breast cancer survivor, who downplayed the seriousness of her illness so as not to worry us kids. I understood that all the kids seemed to know that their mom was sick, and the emotion when they brought those feelings to the surface was good. The scene with her and her husband in bed was also well done. They rest of the movie seemed to make this powerful angle an afterthought, and really just detracted from it.The movie was a waste of the talent of the cast",The Family Stone

Don't get me wrong there were a few funny moments, but for the most part the film had a much darker tone. The were underlying relationship problems between some of the family members as well as with the girlfriend and boyfriends. The Mother was dying and it really ended up being a pretty sad movie. I definitely cried during it. I thought the movie was good. The cast was a bit weird, but the worked. I liked Luke Wilson's character I thought he was really funny.

A disjointed, under and over acted not quite comedy that doesn't even sort itself out by the end of the movie. How is Everett even remotely attracted to Meredith? Sarah Jessica Parker overplays the vicious bitch from hell so much that there is no way Dermot Mulroney's character could ever like her in real life. I hate to say this, but Luke Wilson was the best actor in this movie. I can't even write a good review of this film it was so cobbled together. Be warned, the trailers are very misleading, they are all of the funny scenes from the movie. There is nothing but uncomfortable drama left. And it isn't that dramatic.

Sarah Jessica Parker is perfectly cast for the role of Meredith. Diane Keaton and Craig T. Nelson make the perfect parents for this little ""dysfunctional"" family. This movie has quite the star-studded cast. I personally think Luke is a better actor than Owen, but that may just be me. I thought it would be all about the Meredith/Everett romance, but it is more about the Stone family coming together over the Christmas holiday.

Well, I finally rented and watched it. I was prepared to be really annoyed by some of the actors and actresses, but they all surprised me by playing their roles so well that I was drawn into the movie and watched the characters and not the actors. It was a lot more thought provoking and fresh than the ads ever insinuated. While some of the plot lines where predictable, the humor and portrayal was new enough to make it a really good movie. It was a great mix of humor, drama, and romance and I highly recommend this to males and females alike. PS: Luke Wilson was hilarious.",The Family Stone

There are a couple of hokey scenes, but for the most part this was a *thoroughly* enjoyable film all around. Diane Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Luke Wilson, Sarah Jessica Parker, Brian J. White and Craig T. Nelson are especially stand-out, with Claire Danes, Dermot Mulroney, and Tyrone Giordano filling out the talented cast. If you've got a whacked out family, you'll feel right at home here for the holidays. If you don't, sit back and enjoy what it's like for the rest of us every holiday season!

In addition, just like all my other reviews I love to see a good ensemble cast.Finally, don't watch this movie expecting to see a comedy and don't try to laugh unless you feel basic conversation is funny. Just watch it as a drama and be surprised by some of the humor. It's not a cute movie. It was very nice to see two of the brothers cry when they found out their mother was going to die.

Sure it was ""endearing"" and ""heartwarming,"" but it was every moral I've already seen in every Christmas movie. Sum it up-Chaos, but the Family sticks together. The mother was the only part of the movie that made me think about the moral. Otherwise, I found the movie to be boring and predictable. When I rented it, I thought I was going to be getting a comedy. In my opinion(that may be disagreed with), the ""funny parts"" maxed out at slipping on food in the kitchen. It seemed all to be an attempt to top off every other Holiday movie. ""The Family Stone"" wasn't all bad, the switch between couples was surprising and something new in a Holiday movie.

This movie tries to portray Sarah Jessica Parker's character as the narrow minded ""conservative"". This movie did just the opposite and showed the liberal ""loving"" family to be completely intolerant of anyone different then them. You cannot help but dislike most of the Stone family. The plot is utterly far fetched and not even in a good entertaining way. The one character you are not supposed to dislike (Meredith) was actually the most ""likable."" The dinner scene with Meredith asking a genuine question about homosexuality was so over the top I was rolling my eyes. The reaction of the family was unreal and ridiculous. Who acts like these people? This movie at times felt like a propaganda piece. There were so many mini plots that were just not the least bit believable or even tried to be.I cannot believe that actual good talent signed on for such a wasted lame, unbelievable, cold script. Diane Keaton is a good actress and does a good job in everything she is in. Unfortunately, her job was to portray a character completely unsympathetic and annoying.

She was so artificial but only because she was not so accustomed to people and to social gatherings . she was very uncomfortable in the presence of a large group of people or in the presence of strangers whom meant a lot to her or whom opinions' would matter. she was uncomfortable in job interviews also and whenever she wanted the approval of someone .

The character development for all the roles was virtually non-existent, and when development did occur it was only in split-second changes that left the viewer wondering ""How'd that happen?"" Not only do you come in to this movie feeling like you must have missed the first half, but the multi-plots continue throughout (I kept rewinding it, wondering if I had missed a scene or conversation that would lead into the scene I was watching), making you feel as if you are being bludgeoned with the plot, instead of being swept along with it.This movie needed to be at least six hours long to properly develop everything that's going on - Maybe they could remake it as a miniseries? - but in only 103 minutes, The Family Stone is doomed to disappoint.",The Family Stone

It pushes for some controversy issues in the current society and shows the writer point of view about them.Thomas Bezucha has spent 5 years writing this movie and may be that's why it's such a well written one.It seemed to me that the writer has pondered about how to mix drama and funny in a way that it gets dramatic but not much and it's hilarious throughout. The ending leaves you thoughtful and sad. It makes you go home and embrace the people you love and share your Xmas with them more tightly than ever.

286,pjaldo1,Fun and Touching Family Christmas,8,24 December 2005,"The Stone family gathers for a Christmas like none other in this cute and emotional offering from Director/writer Thomas Bezucha. In a nice twist from the conventional ""meet the family"" romantic comedy, Meredith (Sara Jessica Parker) an uptight Manhattan businesswoman meets her boyfriend's (Durmont Mulroney) very liberal family. The family quickly decides that they do not like this very nervous, wound-up woman and more so, don't think that she's right for their son/brother. Sweet moments of comedy and brief but poignant flashes of drama ensue.I liked this film, if not for the fantastic performances from the always-impressive Diane Keaton and the new-ish Rachel McAdams, but also for the story and love that this film possesses. Though quite liberal, this family sometimes has the hard edge that we've seen in previous romantic comedies, usually from heavily conservative families adjusting to the fumbling, liberal new spouse. The Stone family gaffs at Meredith's ""childish"" conservative views and bitingly mocks her from time to time, not candy-coating this imperfect family in any way. I also enjoyed the road this story traveled, taking what could have been a cookie-cutter romantic comedy, a la Meet The Parents and turned it into a portrait of a flawed but true family.On the bland side of the gingerbread cookies, some of the performances were odd. Sara Jessica's Meredith was frustrating and sometimes grating, as Craig T. Nelson's father figure was seemingly distant at times. The film also seemed to be juggling so many characters that a few are left out in the cold, in terms of development. But I must say, some of the negative criticism the film has garnered has nothing to do with the film itself but rather the perceptions one has when coming into the film. The film is not a laugh-out-loud, roll-inthe aisles comedy but it does have sweet funny moments. The film is not a straightforward romance, but it does show the power of love in its many different forms. If you aren't quite that flexible in your movie watching, this may not be for you. If you cannot envision a world in which liberal families love their family as much as conservative families do, then this film may not be for you. But if you are looking for a sweet Christmas movie that empowers the bonds of love, acceptance, and strength, check out the gem that is The Family Stone.",The Family Stone

The characters are so cliché and hackneyed, it is unbelievable. There seem to be about twenty of them (the characters), and throughout the movie they meet, fall in and out of love, fight, whine, act ridiculous and erratic, wallow in self-pity, and are generally just irritating. Through most of the movie I was saying to myself, ""who ACTS like that?"" Most of the characters are so unlikeable that their behaviour makes it impossible to care at all about what happens to them.There hardly seems to be a coherent plot, and what there is of one is a waste of time.Of course, everything turns out super-duper okay in the end.

289,nomad20,Are we supposed to like Meredith or Sybil?,5,30 December 2005,"BEWARE OF SPOILERSThe filmmaker, Thomas Bezucha, can't decide who's the antagonist and who's the protagonist. Everett (Dermott Mulroney) decides to bring home his serious girlfriend Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker) home for Christmas to meet his family. She receives a less-than-warm welcome from the family. When Everett asks his mother, Sybil (Diane Keaton), for his grandmother's wedding ring (which she promised to him for his bride when he was younger), she says no. This is all fine and could make for fine cinema, but read on for the reasons of my dislike.Meredith starts out as the protagonist, the victim of a family unfairly judging her. Sybil and Amy (Rachel McAdams) start out as the antagonists, the ones that are primarily responsible for hating her and giving her a harsh welcome. But then we find out that Sybil has breast cancer in a pitiful attempt to garner sympathy for her. So what we the audience is supposed to think is ""It's OK that she dislikes her son's choice to be his bride and takes it out on her unfairly. She only wants the best for him because she loves him so much and she knows that Meredith isn't right for him. And because she's dying it's OK that she becomes such a royal pain."" I'm sorry, but I'm not buying it.Half-way through, Bezucha decides to temper our feelings of pity and siding with Meredith by making her seem less desirable and making the family seem more acceptable to us. The scene in which he does this is around the dinner table when Meredith questions Sybil's statement that she wished her sons to be gay (one of the sons is gay and very accepted). The family can't accept Meredith's view, and as Meredith tries to explain herself she just ends us sticking her feet in her mouth and swallowing them. While this scene perfectly shows that ""liberal and accepting"" people can be just as mean and intolerant of those with different views, my opinion is that the goal of the filmmaker with this scene is to garner more sympathy for Sybil and her family.My other big problem is with the final scene. The movie just should have ended with Everett and Julie (Claire Danes), Meredith's sister, getting together. Instead it ends with a soulful and tearful ending that shows the family (with Meredith and Julie to show that they have been accepted into ""the family Stone"") preparing for their first Christmas without Sybil. The last shot is focused onto a photograph of Sybil. I hated that. At first Sybil is the enemy, then she's the mother trying to do right by her children, and then she's a saint. Un-freaking-believable. This final scene also shows Meredith giving an ornament to Amy to begin decorating (Amy as the new matriarch) just to show that they get along and are OK with each other. A plot device so simple its disgusting. Also, the gay son character and his black boyfriend are written into the script as plot devices and not as real characters. They exist only for the scene where Meredith asks upon hearing that they are trying to adopt, ""Do you have a preference as to the race of the child,"" and so that she can have that confrontation with the family.Minor other things I didn't like: We don't know where the movie's at. It is in New England, but it is never established (beyond a few town names) where it is. That annoyed me. And some jokes were just hit and miss, so it wasn't a truly funny movie that should be rated higher.This movie wasn't all bad (which is why it's a 5/10). It was funny, Luke Wilson was great as a brother, and Sarah Jessica Parker was delightful. But overall, it just stunk (but I round up with my ratings).",The Family Stone

Luke Wilson, Sarah Jessica Parker, Craig T Nelson, Dianne Weist, Rachel McAdams and the ENTIRE cast really throw out a complete ensemble performance. Much like watching an accident in slow motion, you can see the subtle nuances of what could or should come next. The priceless scene where Luke Wilsons' character explains in a local bar how the painfully repressed SJ Parkers needs to fly her 'freak flag' is a precious moment in cinematic history.In the end, this movie plays incredibly well after the first viewing simply because of the stellar performances.

I have no intention of giving anything away, not even by offering a 'Spoiler Alert' warning. I'll just say that if you appreciate a good grown-up cinematic experience, if you like to laugh and cry at the same sitting, and you like ensemble pieces, then this film shouldn't disappoint. If I had to 'compare' it other films...not in quality or storyline, more the idea of people in confined 'relationship spaces over a short period of time...I'd offer up 'The Big Chill' and 'Home For the Holidays' (Jodie Foster's 1995 film.)

Sarah Jessica Parker is excellent in her role as Meredith, she absolutely nails her character's uptight and obnoxious nature and subsequent redemption. Craig T. Nelson and Diane Keaton have never been better. The Christmas Eve dining room scene itself is worth the price of admission, never has such a tense family moment ever been better caught on film and the whole cast gives near perfect performances. This film is definitely a roller coaster ride from beginning to end . Anyone who has ever been part of a family will definitely be able to relate to this film in ways that are sometimes comic, sometimes sad. This film is a true slice of life, brilliant in it's depiction of a diverse family who all truly care and love each other.

295,mfi84,"Nah... not worth watching, unless you want to see how bad it is",2,26 December 2005,"First half was OK-ish. Then it got too dramatic and the ending just spoiled the overall image of the movie.The movie was bad mainly because they didn't show properly why Sarah Jessica Parker was hated in the family. If it was because she is so prim and proper, and makes a sweet effort to be nice to everyone, and because she clears her throat now and then, then its all just too stupid. The family has a homosexual member, and yet they are this narrow-minded to hate SJP for no proper reason.Everett falls in love with Julie (SJP's sister) after talking to her for just a couple of hours in a particular scene. It COULD happen in real life, but after all that defending (when he realizes that the family hates his girlfriend)it seemed a little too unrealistic. He has been in love with this girl for a long time, and just when he is about to propose, he is blown away by another girl in just a matter of two hours. (And that too the sister!) It didn't seem very appealing too, the way he fell in love with Julie. We could't quite see how Julie fell in love with Everett as well. This didn't seem to fit in the movie well. And what was more stupid i felt was the way Ben and SJP fell in love. Nothing happened between them in the bar, SJP was just drunk and they only talked a bit in the car afterwords. They didn't even sleep together. And they fall in love. It all made the movie seem silly. Everett's mom was probably the worst character. I don't yet know why she hated SJP, and the whole table scene was the worst scene in the movie.SJP's acting was i thought the only good part though. After seeing her character in Sex and the City i should say that her role in this movie was well done.I repeat, not worth watching, unless you want to see how bad it is. no disrespect to the Producers, but it could have been much much better. it didn't end like a normal Hollywood flick, we all would have expected Everett and SJP to get together in the end; in that way there was a difference to the movie, but it wasn't the sort of difference we all would have enjoyed. A few did though. The majority didn't.",The Family Stone
296,sparkle_fade95,A Bright Step Forward,8,19 December 2005,I thought was a good example of a progressive move forward for the family unit. More then that it has the ability to be able to relate to anyone seeing this movie because of the vastly different characters that still call each other family. I thought the political undertones added to its depth and makes it a step above other basic holiday movies. I like to see a film that can blend both the traditional movie role with new ideas of acceptance and advancement we are seeing as a society. Overall it is a solid family holiday movie with a great cast especially Diane Keaton and Craig T. Nelson as the parents watching their kids make families of their own. Also props to Rachel McAdams for great bits of humor and facial expressions.,The Family Stone
297,ifsheonlyletmesleep,A very touching movie.,9,21 December 2005,"Although the movie wasn't quite what I was expecting it to be, it was not the slightest bit disappointing. The movie delivered on so many levels. It had comedy, it had romance, it had sadness, but most importantly, it had a very touching conclusion. The story was executed very well and the acting was superb. I also liked how the movie focused on a few important social topics. You may or may not agree with the opinions expressed in the movie, but they aren't expressed in a way that makes you feel as though you have to make a choice.There is much more depth to this movie than I thought there would be. If you're looking for a typical Christmas comedy, you might want to look elsewhere, because this movie is anything but typical.",The Family Stone

If was far from that and for the life of me I cannot understand why anyone would make this film for release around Christmas unless you were a true Grinch. The problems in this film are huge.First of all, the Stone family is horrible to Meredith - and we are supposed to get to like these people? Her fiancée hardly sticks up for her so we don't like him much either. Later, Meredith makes comments that lose the sympathy that we have developed for her - though I must say she still doesn't come across as badly as the others do in the way she is ganged up on. Her sister shows up and in the course of less than 24 hours, Meredith's fiancée decides that he'd rather be with her - like this is believable. We see no chemistry at all between them. Even worse, Meredith now falls for her fiancée's brother - again, we can see no chemistry. On top of it all, Mom is dying - Merry Christmas! This is a movie about nasty people doing nasty things to each other - if this is your idea of holiday fare you are welcome to it.

People say that Rachel McAdams was the meanest but I think Diane Keaton was. Man she was so rude to her own kids and she wanted them to be gay. I still would have to say though Amy Stone was one mean girl but she was cute. I enjoyed watching the Stones torment Sarah Jessica Parker. Especially Amy Stone. It was funny and some parts but the funniest actor in this film was Luke Wilson. I just loved the way he acted. He is so funny. Best performance goes to Rachel McAdams, Diane Keaton and Luke Wilson. I would rate this movie 8/10 cause i think more could had been added. But the ending was great cause it was sad and romantic and i felt sorry for Amy.",The Family Stone
300,mt0804,Too Much,3,30 December 2005,"I'm not a big fan of Christmas movies because the plot and characters are such a cliché. This film is no exception. The crazy family - they're all here: the out-there brother (Luke Wilson) who is somehow attracted to a woman, played by Parker, that he would not otherwise even consider if he met her on the street, the amazingly handsome brother (Mulroney) who can be talked into abandoning a life-long dream of a visit to a Buddhist temple by the offer of a drink from Parker's uptight, obsessive character, the catty, sister (McAdams), the loving level headed perfect pregnant wife and mother(Reasor) and the most unrealistic of all - a multi-ethnic, gay couple, one of whom is hearing disabled, who want to adopt a child.The plot takes predictable turns - overnight people fall in love, someone doesn't make it to the end, etc. All of this against a backdrop of a beautiful cozy New England home where it snows only when it will add atmosphere to the scene.The film made great lengths to make Parker's character unappealing. All of the other young women in the cast are beautiful - they practically glow, but not her. Everything from herwardrobe, to her make-up to her hair makes her look like a four-star loser - a well-deserved target for all of the verbal poison that is thrown her way. Instead of hating her, I felt bad for her - how the family continually disapproved of her wasn't funny - it was mean.Rent this on video - don't get caught in the stampede at the movies for yet another dose of Hollywood's formula concept of Christmas in America. Don't get me wrong - I know that people act up at Christmas. I just wish someone would commit to make one that does not require us to suspend belief.",The Family Stone
301,shegi1013,subject matter of family stone inapproicated and sleazy,1,31 December 2005,"I thought the actions between the couples that the story was centered around were inapproicated. The creators of this movie try to sell to the audience that this was a love story that we could just fall in love with and that the we would root for these couples. I found myself thinking that this is too much to shove in my face. I could not accept the two sisters getting with the two brothers at the end. It was totally unrealistic that Merith would be cool with her sister getting with her almost fiancé. Furthermore, Merith's boyfriend must not been too in love with her because he fell for her sister as soon as she got off the bus. In fact, he seem very screwed up in the head. If he realized that Merith was not the one for him, how was he so sure in that second of meeting her sister that she was the one. I think this movie was an excuse to explore family members swapping sexual partners. I also think it was a cheap shot to market this film as a light hearted comedy for you to see around the holidays. I got real irriated when the pulled the death card. I did not want to see a movie about someone's parent dieing around Christmas. That is really too painful. I really hated this movie. I just thought the subject matter of this movie was sleazy and the marketing tactics about this movie being a comedy underhanded.",The Family Stone
302,koffeegod-1,This Movie Tries To Have It Both Ways - And Fails Miserably,3,20 November 2007,"I won't delve into the utterly contrived conservative/liberal clichés oozing from every pore of this movie. No matter where you stand politically, there is still plenty about this film to disappoint.First, the plot itself is a tired rehash of the classic ""Son/Daughter brings awkward fiancé to meet the tight-knit yet disapproving family during the holidays"" film that gets made (and remade) seemingly every year. It plays like a mash-up of 'Meet the Parents', 'The Ice Storm' and 'The Wedding Crashers' where a shaky relationship founded in mutual self-delusion encounters family dysfunction. Hilarity ensues.The eponymous ""family Stone"" is the nearly farcical epitome of the stereotypical New England liberal household: The parents, portrayed by Craig T Nelson and Dianne Keaton, are over emotional, self-indulgent, ex-hippie baby boomers who have raised a houseful of equally self-absorbed children. There's the spoiled brat youngest daughter played by Rachel McAdams; the dutiful, international businessman son (Mulroney); the quiet, pregnant daughter (Elizabeth Reaser) with the precocious 10-year old daughter of her own; the laid back, black-sheep, pot-smoking son (Luke Wilson); and last, but not least, the token gay son (Giordano) who's also deaf, in a biracial civil union and trying to adopt a child. I was a bit surprised that they didn't just go all the way and make him a vegan, an atheist, and an abortion-clinic doctor as well. But I digress...The other two main characters are equally 1-dimensional. A severe Sarah Jessica Parker plays the stiff, cool fiancé who has a penchant for sticking her foot in her mouth and Claire Daines rounds out the ensemble as her charming yet clumsy (and clueless) sister.Binding these distractingly flawed characters together is a plot as predictable as it is implausible. Mere suspension of disbelief is insufficient to carry you past the numerous and inevitable ""Oh, come on!"" moments. For instance, the movie begins with Everett bringing his fiancé home for the holidays to meet his family for the first time. Yet the Stone family is so immediately and vehemently disapproving of her and so utterly contemptuous in their judgment that you are left wondering if you somehow missed the prequel. Only a clan of misanthropic nepotists would behave this way. Where is the slow, awkward build-up of animosity? Where is the gradual clash of personalities that leads to the inevitable climax over Christmas dinner? Instead, the filmmakers ungracefully dictate to us at the outset how we should feel about each character instead of letting us choose for ourselves. I believe that it is this heavy-handed style of storytelling that puts so many people off of this film. Another cause for disbelief is how incredibly shallow the relationships portrayed in this film are. You would think that you were watching an adaptation of a P.G. Wodehouse novel. No fewer than six characters conveniently fall in and out of love within a single, snow-filled night. How this occurs is completely bewildering as not a single couple shows even a modicum of believable romantic chemistry. In fact, it felt so contrived that I began to feel condescended to.To counterbalance the all-too-frequent ""who really acts like that?"" moments, the filmmakers attempted to weave in a tear-jerking terminal illness, cutting the levity like a serrated knife at times and lending some weight to an otherwise insubstantial film. Unfortunately, their inelegant attempt to offer a convenient explanation for the family's angst ends up feeling desperate and forced. Instead of evoking empathy for the characters I felt disappointment. The filmmakers had a golden opportunity to redeem the family by having them respond to the illness with courage and nobility. Instead they show nothing but immaturity and self pity.This is why the movie ultimately fails. It tries to blend dysfunctional comedy with dramatic overtones but ends up muddling them both. You can never quite get over the ham-fisted storytelling as you are dragged, sometimes forcefully, through the film until you arrive at the other side completely unsatisfied and slightly angry.",The Family Stone
303,Canterburyever,What a waste!,3,7 February 2006,"The most unbelievable thing about The Family Stone is how the heck did the producers manage to assemble such a fine cast for such a poor movie? Did they swap the scripts on the first day of filming? I had high hopes walking into this one, but they were dashed in the first half an hour. Sarah Jessica Parker plays Meredith Morton, a highly strung, intense career woman who is going out with Everett Stone (Dermot Mulroney on auto pilot). When Everett decides to bring Meredith home to meet his family over Christmas, things start to deteriorate as Meredith embarrasses herself with a series of cringe worthy moments. When she decides she can't take the flak from the family, Meredith asks her sister Julie (a nothing role from Claire Danes) to come and stay. Not even the lovable Luke Wilson, who plays Everett's brother Ben, could salvage this sinking ship. The final hour is awful, as logic is completely thrown out the window. There are many gaping holes in this movie. At one stage I thought the cinema might have skipped about half an hour of screen time. Unless you are a massive fan of any of these cast members, I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie. Although compared to Deuce Bigalow 2, this is Academy Award winning stuff.",The Family Stone

305,illumine-1,Good mix of genres -- surprisingly poignant,8,8 March 2006,"This movie was sadly missing from the Oscars this year. It had great writing and plot and was the first movie that I've seen that fits squarely in both comedy and drama genres. They're going to have trouble deciding which section to put it in at movie rental stores once it comes out on DVD. But that very flexibility is what gives it an 8 in my book. I probably would have classified it as a 7 (due to a couple unfortunate cheesy romantic scenes and general predictability in that area), but the performances by Sarah Jessica Parker and Diane Keaton pull it up to a solid 8 and push it close to 9. It is a stellar ensemble cast and definitely worth seeing--with one recommendation...bring tissues.",The Family Stone
306,greenknight884,The Family Hypocrites,1,9 June 2006,"I was sure that I would enjoy this movie, given its stellar cast and funny trailer. I thought it would be a heartwarming movie about misunderstandings and the mutual awkwardness of meeting your in-laws.What the trailers left out was the fact that the family hates their prospective daughter-in-law Meredith without ever giving her a chance. That they are irritating people who use their gay deaf son and his black husband to bait outsiders into saying or doing presumably bigoted things. (I'm fine with the fact that diversity is represented here, but I hate how dialogue about that diversity is squelched instead of brought out.) That despite their violent hatred toward intolerance, they are some of the most deeply prejudiced, intolerant, vicious, unsympathetic people of all. And their prideful malice is directed toward an obviously insecure woman with no real faults other than being overly concerned about making a good impression. Let's get one thing straight. Having annoying tics does not make someone a bad person. Being uptight does not make someone a bad person (think Monica on Friends).Throughout the movie I was waiting for Meredith to get her comeuppance, like Ben Stiller's character does in Meet the Parents. It never really comes. Instead, she learns to be more like them, and they basically get away with what they want. The lesson is, gang up on people who are different than you, and they'll come around.I truly want to know why some people have such nice things to say about this movie. None of the characters is likable or even realistic. They are rude and unfriendly to whomever they want, and cloyingly sweet and warm with each other. They judge the new girl based on appearances and social class, and make no attempt to hide it. And the women especially are cliquish, bullying, belittling, and can strip down any shred of self-worth she may feel. And the cruelest of them all is played by Rachel McAdams.Wait a minute, this is starting to sound familiar ...",The Family Stone

308,groovykitty_14,The Awesome cast of an under-rated movie,9,20 May 2006,"One of the most downplayed movies yet. I was curious to see it considering its star-studded cast, though apprehensive, b/c in the past, star-studded movies tend to be not-so-good. And another thing that made me wonder really how good it was, was the lack of advertising and the way it seemed to zip to the cheap theaters rather quickly. That tends to be a sign of bad movies (ex. The Producers).Anyways, I was not disappointed. I've read that some people think it's a mixed bag and can't keep a mood for ten minutes. It WAS a mixed bag, but in a good way! You laugh, you cry, you feel for the characters, it's sweet, it's natural, it has several awesome moments. The mood changed often, b/c that's what moods do in homes. Especially in the situations of this particular family.The actors were great: Luke Wilson as Ben, was calm and relaxed and lovable. Dermot Mulroney as Everett was exceedingly handsome and easy to emphasize with. Sarah Jessica Parker as Meredith was super uptight and humorous. Diane Keaton as Sybill was quirky and believable. Claire Danes as Julie was sweet and cool. Rachel McAdams was snotty and mean, yet fun. The rest of the cast fit together perfectly, weaving a heartwarming, touching, laugh-out loud funny, superb and under-advertised movie!",The Family Stone
309,whirlwinded,Enjoyable,8,24 June 2006,"As far as ""The Family Stone"" is concerned, I knew it was the kind of movie I wanted to see from the beginning. I have a thing for witty but melancholic movies that warm your heart, and this was no different. I don't particularly like Sarah Jessica Parker, but I thought she was great as the uptight Meredith. Diane Keaton, whom I've always been intrigued by due to her quirky charm dating back to ""Annie Hall"" and I can see that Woody Allen made a wise decision by setting off her career. She was lovable, spontaneous, and just enjoyable. My favorite of the bunch had to be Rachel McAdams. Granted, ""Mean Girls"" was fun but it didn't really let people see talents because it was so focused on idiotic comedy. But Rachel McAdams can act. I loved her in ""The Notebook"" even though the movie is starting to annoy me due to how publicized it has become. Amy was a median role, she wasn't the villainess that Regina George was nor the heroine in all the Allie Hamilton gusto, but a real person.

311,pimienta7,A Quirky Intelligent Comedy,8,28 August 2006,"There's more to this comedy than meets the eye. More subtle nuances in the story than really should be contained in a 95 minute movie, and at times I felt that the directors cut more than they should've (see deleted scenes)...which left me curious as to whether there was a book out there it was based on. There isn't...and this makes it difficult to really understand the character development unless you watch it twice, or even three times.The Stone family is an extremely tight-knit New England set with a rough history - but you MUST pay attention to understand that, or all you'll see is an ultra-liberal family with a strong intolerant strain that doesn't accept anything conservative (which really isn't the case once you grasp the nature of the family).The character of Meredith (Parker) is more than just a conservative Bedford businesswoman...she is trying to make an impression on the Stone family as an ideal bride for the ""perfect"" first son, who is nearly idolized by the rest of the family, and the mother - Sybil (Keaton) in particular. You begin to understand the standard he's held to during the scene when you meet Julie (Danes) and the family's reaction to her.Seemingly, during the Christmas dinner scene, it would appear that the family is merely baiting Meredith, but Sybil is drawing out something that she's been trying to determine since she first met Meredith...and during the dinner scene, the true relationship between the sisters (Meredith and Julie) becomes extremely clear...underscoring the reason that Meredith came together with this ideal son in the first place - and that their union wasn't ideal at all...and that it had nothing to do with the family he comes from. The Stone family is extremely protective of each other, for reasons that go further than initially understood, and if the watcher pays attention to the precise dialog, there is an understanding that each of the Stone family members is flawed, they all understand that about each other, and there is a difficulty with allowances for someone who lacks that comprehension.By Christmas morning, during the gift exchange, many truths come out - and Sybil's seeming dislike of Meredith shows for what it is - that to be a part of the Family Stone you must walk through their fire, and that nobody expects you to be anything other than who/what you are...but first, you HAVE to be who you are, and not bother trying to be impressive or ideal. Just to be real. When the lovely reality of who Meredith really is beyond the cloak of Bedford perfection shines through, then the checkpoint of who she should be with is revealed, though it was shown VERY clearly in the opening scenes of the movie.Intelligently crafted and brilliant dialog...though more time should have been given to character development.",The Family Stone

315,salbaroli,Diplomacy in a family,8,14 February 2007,"Honestly my 8/10 vote is an exceeding approximation of a 7 or 7,5 over 10, but considering the low general rate I opted for a higher vote.The poor Mulroney still gets the ""pretty bachelor"" roles, which nevertheless plays well, but the other actors too embody their roles in the right way.Everybody, one time in his life, felt a fish out of water with strangers. Not a thing you say fits the conversation or it's the wrong occasion to deal with an argument. Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker) is a girl entering the family of his boyfriend for the Christmas week, but she quickly feels embarrassed, hampered to establish a bond with any of the members. When Meredith calls the sister to ""save"" her things get even worse, because Julie (Claire Danes) is soon welcomed as she were an old family friend.Instead of revenges or additional quarrels, in the second half gets start a diplomatic work by the family members to settle the conflicts and overcome incomprehension.Substantially it's a drama because Bezucha tries to focus on Meredith state of mind, her frustration of being rejected with (apparently) no valid reasons, the scene at the dinner is quite sad, and yet it's at intervals funny and cheerful, considering the (obligatory) happy ending too. The acting, by the great Keaton and Luke Wilson or Craig Nelson is truly good, decent for Parker and Danes, irritating (I'm sorry) McAdams and Mulroney, more for their characters than for their performances. A bit stereotyped the gay couple too, but it's functional for the story.A dramatic comedy that could be great to watch with the whole family, satisfying the diverse tastes and feelings with a numerous, capable cast.",The Family Stone

317,Imradyourenot,'Drather have kidney stones,1,29 March 2007,"This is a story of dramatic suspense, intrigues, seductions, betrayal, and deceit all culminating in a tragic ending. Our story is about Brad Stevenson, an EMS worker, who prepossesses the viewer's admiration and respect before his appearance, but who oddly doesn't show up until half way into the movie and more surprisingly not very often in the rest of the movie either. The film is about his reencounter and subsequent pitiable demise at the hand of the Stone family, tragically brought about by his irrational and blind love. The movie begins by introducing the members of the Stone family, which makes one question if Saddam Hussein, apart from having hidden stores of weapons of mass destruction, might also have a hidden second family living in America. Brad is hopelessly devoted in his love for Amy Stone, which acts for us as a vivid reminder that such irrational feelings are clearly blind and often utterly stupid, and that love is ultimately unjust and seldom bestowed on a worthy recipient; but regardless, Brad's got it bad. The Stone family, like the Borg, wish to assimilate this naive romantic fool and annihilate the decency which his nature possesses, save the biomechanical additions, and the audience is forced to witness this horrific development unfold. Brad's internal flaw (his love for Amy and association with the Stone Family in general) struggles on a subconscious level with his recognition of the Stone family's love for evil and destruction of all things Good. This is symbolically revealed in both of his innocent gifts to Amy and in the subplots represented by the internal struggles and conflicts between the other members of the Stone family and some like-minded outsiders who all embark on a series of confrontation and/or swapping of genetic material. However, as much as we wish for Brad to escape their clutches, the events have been set in motion, and Brad is ultimately blind and doomed to his fate. His goodness is eventually immolated for his ""love"" on the Stone's altar in his marriage to Amy. The movie ends with the death of the mother of the family (the editor having cut out the scenes where some do-gooder must have shoved a stake into her heart), thus leaving the position for head demon of the family vacant, but then the film alludes to Brad's eventual succession to the position of the head demon under the auspices of his wife Amy. Like the movie itself, the title of the movie is clever, ""The Family Stone"", as it has many layers of meaning, and acutely describes the family's hearts, IQs, jewelry, and bonding practices.For all the complications and stone-gray areas that the movie presents us with, the movie will inevitably impact your own life and make you take something away from it. The movie is nearly perfect, it only had three minor flaws: 1) It cost money; 2) It took time away from my life; 3) I have to spend the rest of my life with memories of it and knowing I watched it.

Mildly amusing through its first-half, The Family Stone is so saccharine in its cloying clichés I thought I might go into a sugar coma after its started tying up the various story lines. And it ties up every one, one by one until they're all neatly wrapped and tied with a bow. But not content with piling syrup on top of sugar cubes on top of fudge on top of cookies and cake and candy and topping it off with whipped cream it adds a cherry with a one year later seen to HAMMER the warmth into you.But more than this, it's pretentious vulgarity was even more offensive. The film's point of view is ""sensitive"" and ""understanding"" and it poses as a highly sensitive and politically correct depiction of the warmly human, sensitive and politically correct family struggling to accommodate itself to a humorless uptight stranger. Their faults are all admitted to and exposed as if they had all been in therapy for years. But this is all done in the service of a vulgar wish fulfillment ending.I was reminded of the scene in Annie Hall when Woody Allen tries to discourage Diane Keaton from getting a book about cats in her search for a good book. He knew his girl well. She is still doing the cat book. I have no doubt this movie will find its fans among those who share her appetite for books about kitties.",The Family Stone
324,oceanpark55,Tolerence and acceptance portrayed in Stone,8,30 April 2007,"The acting is quite good. The story is about a guy who brings his fiancé who appears to be an understandably nervous, somewhat conservative, very polite, well bred young woman home to spend the Christmas holiday with his very liberal bohemian family. Nearly everything that is attractive about the young woman is repugnant to the family. Right off the bat, they ridicule her because she prefers and requests, out of a sense of propriety and respect to them, separate sleeping arrangements. Every innocent, well intentioned question, act, or gesture she makes is construed as an abomination of disrespect, bigotry, rudeness, callousness, and insensitivity on her part when in fact it is they who are so entrenched and blinded in an extreme, far left liberal agenda that they cannot accept or show the least sense of diplomatic respect to anyone who does not embrace their ways of thinking or behavior. The film is really unbelievable in that in expects you to believe that a family of worldly, educated people, regardless of political persuasions, would actually treat a guest in their home the way they do. Not only is this polite young woman an invited guest in their home but she is the person their son and brother, whom they love, has chosen to marry. Amid the unfolding amusement, I kept wondering if whether the young woman wants to attend a Christmas spiritual service, will they burn her at the stake on their front lawn. They seemingly only lighten up on her after they believe that the woman has spent the night with the brother of the man she was intending to marry and she gives them all a lovely and thoughtful Christmas gift of a portrait of the mean spirited matriarch pregnant with the equally mean spirited daughter. The predictable plot is mildly convoluted and clichéd but the film is highly recommended for hilarity. I don't know when I've ever enjoyed a movie more out of its sheer sense of absurdity. The Stones are caricatures of the family from hell.",The Family Stone

We absolutely did not like this movie and stopped 20 minutes despite having paid for it. I cannot believe that anyone wants to suffer through such an unpleasant monotony of ""clever"" and rudeness. Not funny. The guy playing Everett was about as interesting as cardboard. Diane Keaton's character was not bohemian, rather, she was rude and selfish. What a waste of decent performers. Luke Wilson was likable; Rachel McAdams played a bitch. I wanted to like someone in the movie and found Craig Nelson okay.

So any way, yes, I did think that the movie was going to be much lighter and cheery -- fluffy, if you will. It was deeper *fluff* than just *fluff* and yes, I cried. But that said, I enjoyed it quite a bit. I like the way the family interacted with each other - for example the older sister Susanna reading on that something was wrong with mom before any one else-this mirrored my own family in that we are so close, and can read each other... There were other parts that just made me laugh, and I look forward to owning this when it comes out on DVD. ""Feel the love"" is the tag line. I think it fits.",The Family Stone

I love Rachel McAdams and I somewhat like Sarah JP. It was amazing!!!! My family loved it, I loved it and we have been talking about it since we saw it. I think the key though to enjoying this movie is going in with few expectations. I was not expecting much and loved this movie. The funny thing about this movie is that we all cried... It was just at different moments in the film due to our own feelings about families, etc. I laughed so hard I cried too.... I cannot give this movie enough praise...

The first point in the movie where my radar went up, was when Rachel McAdams comes home from college wearing a big NPR shirt. From there the money continues to descend into deliberate liberal agenda - a gay interracial couple adopts a deaf baby - REALLY? Are you sure you couldn't squeeze a few more political agendas in there, maybe one of them had their clitoris removed or something?This movie is horrible from start to finish.

331,warmsoda,Bringing Down the House,7,2 March 2007,"In ""The Family Stone"" Sarah Jessica Parker stars as Meredith, a high-strung professional who battles against the evil, mean-spirited Stone family, and loses. In an act of desperation, Meredith burns down the family's house with herself in it. When her sister (Claire Danes) visits her grave, Meredith grabs her arm from the ground and pulls her into the underworld.Okay, okay none of that happened. In actuality, Meredith and the Stones, while both uptight, are not nearly as horrible as some make them out to be. Nervous Meredith, a fiancé to one of the Stones, is mostly a victim of misunderstandings that some take too seriously. Susannah Stone (Elizabeth Reaser) avoids conflict and is the most reasonable family member, even while pregnant. Ben Stone (Luke Wilson) is a bit of a pervert but is an all-around nice guy that helps Meredith relax a little.One of the worst Stones is Sybil (Diane Keaton). When Meredith, and later Susannah's husband John, is around she can't help but frown and roll her eyes. But she only worries about her children and the devastating secret she's keeping from them. There is a lot of tears but things somehow resolve themselves and everyone has a happy life.The movie is incredibly unrealistic but the acting is good and the production is well done so you may not care. Also Meredith gets her revenge near the end of the movie by peeing on the walls. Okay, that doesn't happen either.",The Family Stone

Oh please. I am not generally one for movies of this kind but actually found it quite funny/entertaining/heart wrenching. If you do not have family members who embarrass you, are judgmental to outsiders, live an alternative lifestyle, etc...do not assume that all families are like yours. The Stone family, admittedly, does have a lot of clichés all bundled into one but that's Hollywood for ya! They placed them all into a fun- loving, romantic comedy that shed light on a family's concerns for each other. Quite possibly in a crass manner haha but set during a time when they are also heavily reliant on the love and support of one another. Family may be your biggest critic, or sometimes worse, but also your biggest support. Don't read so much into the negative hype and enjoy the film for what it truly is...A FILM.",The Family Stone
334,topdog-5,I did not expect to enjoy this film so much,8,11 March 2007,"I admit, I only rented this DVD because I like the Wilson brothers and one of them (Luke) is in it. I don't even remember this film being in the theaters. But I loved it! It was one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in quite awhile. Cinematically, it was nothing impressive, but the writing and the acting was quite good and the end actually made me cry (that's pretty hard to do). It is a rare movie where I can honestly say, everyone in the cast did a great job. And the screenwriters did a great job too. One problem with a lot of Hollywood films, for me at least, is the unbelievability of the characters or the one-sidedness of characters. All of the characters in this film were believable and had good and bad aspects to them. I guess if you are looking for a more fantasy-based storyline, this wouldn't be the film for you. The interactions are all very realistic and it plays out like a realistic holiday that could occur in just about any family. You won't come away from the film learning any great, deep lessons, but you will come away feeling entertained, and wishing that you could keep in touch with the characters to see where their lives take them.",The Family Stone
335,drbobpierce,"A film that offers laughs, tears, and love in the holiday season.",9,21 December 2005,"I saw this movie even though one critic I read was displeased with this film; his criticisms, mostly directed at Diane Keaton's hostile attitude toward Sarah Jessica Parker's character, Meredith, made little sense when I viewed the film and I suspect he left it part-way through. This is a film that captures the sweet-sour nature of the Christmas holiday season; a time when relatives love to come together for family reunions, and then begin to chafe upon each other with each passing day. There is deep love in this film, some bittersweet humor, and exceptional performances by the major characters. Diane Keaton will score another Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Sybil, the mother of the Stone family, but all the characters are well-defined and have depth of character. The plot unfolds at a deeper level than previews would suggest and it is well worth your time and attention to details, which suggest major plot developments. This is a ""It's a Wonderful LIfe,"" for the modern age of angst and real families, which often are not the '50s Ozzie and Harriet versions popular in another time. There is a nice shot of ""Meet Me In St. Louis,"" that reflects the passing of cultural tastes from the 1940s to the present day. Even if some critics have been less than kind to this film, remember that ""It's a Wonderful Life"" was not a success when first released.",The Family Stone

The cast of actors do a workmanlike job but the direction is quite lack luster. But there are moments of fun, drama, farce and poignancy that sometimes lift the film out of its clichéd parameters. It's a pleasant enough film but does not want repeated viewing. There are better films which deal more honestly with the issues this film raises. Try Hannah and her Sisters, Krampak, Festen, Annie Hall, Sleepless in Seattle, the list goes on. If you want a film that pleasantly passes a couple of hours that neatly acts like a TV film then this film is for you but It does nothing more than that.",The Family Stone
337,calmwaterpictures,People just don't get it!!,10,20 December 2005,It's amazing how creating a film that doesn't fit the usual formula can put off so many people. I suppose thats an indication that Hollywood is dumbing there audiences with a lot of shallow crap. But then again there is a market for it.This film is not in that category. This is a surprising film that deals with LIFE. And with realism.It's doesn't surprise me that a lot of audiences see Merideth and Everett as the central characters and that the plot circulates around Meritdeths integration into the family. But it isn't about that at all -it's about family relationships and dealing with Sybal (the central character -subtly) Sybal is the family stone and Merideth is just an excuse for everyone to take out their pain on her. They all know she is sick from the start and are still dealing with it. What they don't know is that it's back and worse. They'll lose they're stone.Come on people! Is everyone becoming desensitized! Read a little deeper! The social trend tends to be that a lot of people don't like being made to feel such strong emotions off guard.I take my hat off to the Director.,The Family Stone

It express human feelings in a way that for me who wrote this story is undeniably a genius. It shows how every family should be, its a real life lesson. It shows how each person on a family should feel like being a driver in the car of his life and steering and paying attention all the time when steering to the right or to the left to make sure you are not really hurting anyone's feelings.

You're flirting and basically saying you like her, and yet you haven't broken up with your actual girlfriend. Really smart.When she Meredith, Everett just goes out to have some coffee with the sister. Okay, your girlfriend just ran out and your going to go get some damned coffee? Funny how someone (Ben) who has only known Meredith for barely a week runs after her.But her damned 'boyfriend' just wants coffee? Even after all the chaos, Everett is still chasing after the damned sister. ""Oh no, I don't want you to leave!"" speech was hilarious. You barely know a damned thing about her, and you act like you want to make out with her.Then again, the Ben/Meredith relationship was almost like that. But people do have a habit of running into other relationship when the first one fails.Am I the only one that thinks Everett just wanted to get into the girl's pants?I'm sorry, but Everett came off as asshole to me.

341,julesmollica,Better off snowed in,4,24 November 2005,"A poor attempt at a 'quirky family holiday drama' where star Dianne Keaton plays the SAME character as always. Sarah Jessica Parker works hard but is only an anxious version of Carrie Bradshaw in this film, playing the uptight girlfriend brought home to meet the family. The family's initial response is unwarranted - they resent her immediately though it's clear she's trying hard. They exclude with their silly teasing, jokes and secrets. The characters all try too hard to be different with their little habits - the untamed university student, the hippie, the career man, the protective mother, all played to extremes. There's no background given to characters, and dramatic moments carry less weight because of this. Predictable humour, schmaltzy family scenes, unreal story/character developments and average dialogue make for a disappointing experience.",The Family Stone

Within something less than 15 minutes, I worked out why this might be, and deduced something of the reason for the spouse's ... umm... vagueness when describing what she knew of the film's plot. After about half an hour, I was hoping for the assorted Stone Family and their friends to be captured by terrorists, with only a few of them surviving to be rescued by someone like Bruce Willis. 15 minutes after that, and I would have settled for the terrorists blowing up the cinema. The spouse tells me she really enjoyed it - laughed and cried even. But, then again, she would. It had every heart warming cliché in the book except for a cute puppy, and that impression was added to by the (ok, I give up) serious beauty of cold and snowy Christmases (it was hot in Oz, as it always is). For me, the joy was getting the annual chick-flick over on 3 January. Plus, I now know why I can't stand Sarah Jessica Parker (it's not just the three names) and that Dermot Mulroney acts like a fine piece of cabinet-making. Diane Keaton was better than workpersonlike, in a sort of Judi Dench slumming it mode. The rest of the film could have been cast by Lego.",The Family Stone

I hated it, and my girlfriend hated it (that's how bad it was), and both agree that this is the worst chick flick we have seen in a long time. Predictable, stupid, cheap drama, corny, cheesy, etc....seriously, the only reason we finished watching it is so we could find out if the predictions we made became true so we could get a good laugh out of it.

I can't say anymore then it fills you heartso go see it. Oh, the end is a little hooky but hey, it's the movies. Rachel McAdams is always a favorite, and she delivered a good performance. This movie was the first movie that you actually hated S. J. P.'s character. She was just down right mean and awful. But I was in love with Susannah.

I did enjoy portions of the movie but it certainly did put a downer on the rest of my day which isn't too fun during the holidays.

348,bethkq,LOVED this movie,10,1 December 2006,"I consider this movie to be one of the best movies I've seen in the past five years. I was disappointed to read that last comment about how someone thought it was unrealistic, they were turned off by how much the family disliked Meredith from the very beginning, and none of the characters were likable. I believe the absolute opposite of all of those complaints. I thought it was so realistic, and that is what made it so fantastic. Families can be horrible sometimes. Families can be really awful to outsiders while they are protected within the bubble of familiarity among themselves. That happens. And Meredith is not a very lovable person at first either. She is awkward and overly formal and incapable of going with the flow, and the unbelievably awkward dinner scene is a showcase of how Meredith can be a really extremely annoying person. But that is humanity. I don't think it made the characters unlikeable that they were shown for what they really are, I think it made them so extremely likable in that we saw all their worst faults, and I completely loved them anyway. I think every single character in the film is just worthy of adoration by the end. People talk about how awful Rachel McAdams' character was. She has quite a few very obvious issues that you come to understand by the end of the movie. She LOVES her family, so much that she doesn't want anything to change among them. She doesn't want her brother to get married, she doesn't want to welcome a new member, she hated Thad's boyfriend at first too. That is a real person to me. She can be mean, but at the heart of her meanness is this intense love for her family, and I love that about her. I could go on forever. All I can say to people who didn't like this movie, please watch it again with an open mind. Don't go into any movie, but especially this one, with a set of expectations that will ultimately let you down. This isn't just some slapstick kooky family comedy for the holidays. This movie has such deep emotion to it, and it has a lot of laughs, and it has some really terrible moments of real cruelty. For anyone who is part of a close family, you'll know that all those things are pieces of what that means.

Not in the way she's being introduced...as the future wife of Everett...the eldest son, who more than likely is going to ""take over the empire"" when the dad and the mother pass on. They don't see her as a queen especially of that household, especially since she doesn't even carry the same morals. Enter Julie...the exact free spirit, strong minded, self aware woman they expect to see for Everett who was once the same down an opposite path away from his true self, that Meredith would've only further taken him down, which the family did not want.It's a strange movie, doing normal movie tropes in strange and different ways, but coming out the same...in one cleanly wrapped conclusion of a box with pretty bows.In the end, everett found his rightful queen, ben found his fitting flawed woman familiar to the family ways, and even the little sister was able to find happiness that she was probably afraid to welcome knowing how picky her family is about newbies...thanks to Meredith. And because of all these neatly tied bows, the mother could die in peace knowing her children are okay. And the father and Suzanna are just loving and accepting of everything. They're the real heart of the family. And then thad and his boyfriend...the whole reason for them being so tight knit and protective can also still be at peace and comfortable being who he is.I really liked this movie, as odd and painful as it was to watch at some points (the dinner scene; Criiinge). I felt bad for Meredith, i felt bad for the family, but i liked how it somehow managed to work itself out.It was a mess, but it was a weird, wonderful, comforting mess.I recommend it just for the experience or the watch.",The Family Stone

As I think about it (I saw it two days ago), I am dissatisfied with the film more. To be honest, you have to suspend disbelief to a certain extent in most films, and you have to believe that people fall for each other in an instant in romantic comedies. Without revealing any spoilers, there were just too many changes of heart for me to continue to support the story, and one issue in particular regarding Claire Danes character was just unbelievable on its face.

I thought it would be a bit sappy and another cute but predictable Christmas movie, but it's not. It's daring, well-made, well- acted and far from predictable in every way. It was like watching (a captivating) theatrical piece, since most of the film was shot inside the house. The characters are all very original and one cannot help to be a part of this interesting family from the beginning. You will giggle, laugh out loud and cry during this film and sometimes these emotions are felt one after another, quite fast. It moves fast, with many things going on at once, but never difficult to follow. As someone is exiting the room, another person enters and sometimes everything happens all at once. But this doesn't create anxiety. I very much enjoyed the parts where sexual preferences and racism were tapped on...and that part was quite interesting. Diane Keaton was phenomenal and it was really exciting to see her in such a soulful role. Her characters' liberal style of loving, raising her children and how she chose to deal with certain emotions were a pleasure to watch. Go see it and I'm sure you'll enjoy it just as much as I did.

354,brown_99,Intolerant and Mean Movie - should have walked out,1,2 January 2006,"I thought this was a comedy, no, it was not although there are a few laughs. I think this movie is more of a study (if you want to call it that) into the liberal mind. It's mostly mean, nasty and intolerant. It's the kind of movie that leaves you with a bad feeling except for the relief when it is over.The mother played by Diane Keaton was nasty and mean and intolerant. She made comments you would only expect by the world's worst mothers. You would expect some of her comments from a sailor in a bar but meaner. It was mostly disgusting, not funny unless you have a bizarre sense of humor.The family as a whole are mean and intolerant. Nearly all of the family treat the son's girlfriend very bad and it was uncomfortable.Very little of it was funny. There were some funny scenes few and far between. To call this a comedy #1 is wrong as wrong can be. Personally, I think it's a fraud to call this a comedy.There is a small amount of romance in this movie and a few laughs but most of it is obviously intended to be mean and nasty and shocking too.If you are miserable person and you want to see a miserable movie, then this is the movie for you.I almost walked out after about 50 minutes. I wish I had. This was one of the three worst movies I've ever seen.This is NOT a Christmas movie other than it is set at Christmas time.It's not a nice movie. It's a mean and often nasty movie.",The Family Stone
355,chloe-church,A family of sociopaths sets out to torture a woman with social anxiety.,1,19 September 2015,"In this movie, Dermot Mulroney brings his girlfriend home to be humiliated by his family. The family is unfathomably cruel to her for no apparent reason. Dermot Mulroney does not defend her, and in fact seems to quite obviously hate her. Their relationship appears to be some sort of vicious joke at her expense, as he seems openly contemptuous of her. (Then again, Dermot Mulroney always appears to be openly contemptuous of his romantic leads.) She calls her sister for moral support, and the sister of course takes the side of the horrible family and falls in love with Dermot Mulroney. There is a point when the family has driven her from the house in tears, and they hear her crash a car into a tree, not once, but twice. They continue eating, rather than check to see if their guest has died on their lawn (except for Luke Wilson, the only member of the family to show a modicum of human decency to the character, because wants to sleep with her). This film seems less like a movie and more like a very upsetting stress dream. Happily, Dermot Mulroney's awful mother dies. Sadly, everyone else lives.",The Family Stone
356,ronwraw,What? I'm still confused!,6,31 December 2005,"This movie is SO confusing I'm still asking myself questions about it! Granted, I am only 14, but still- how many twists can a movie have? My friends and I were laughing the whole time, but mostly about all the incredibly random and weird plot twists. There are some very funny scenes, but a lot of the movie is back-and-forth battling between Sarah Jessica Parker and Rachel McAdams, SJP and Luke Wilson (who's character is the funniest, sweetest one in the family), and Claire Danes and Dermot Mulroney. It gets a little old. The Family Stone is also a major tearjerker. When I walked into the theater, I was expecting the regular siblings-vs-girlfriend pranks and such, but the movie was a lot different than my expectations. Diane Keaton is the best actor in the movie- she'll make you cry and laugh! I'd say it's an average movie, but surprising and very funny. Deserves a go-see.",The Family Stone
357,haltaylorlawyer,A Faulted Classic,7,2 January 2006,"I think that this movie--for all of its faults and obvious heart string pulling--will become a classic. The key is Craig T. Nelson and his essential humanity. All of the other characters at one point or another go too far over the top, but he is true to his role as the essential glue that holds this family together. I am a sucker for the old-fashioned attempt to reach into the heart of the audience. For me, this movie worked on that level. If you can watch the present opening scene and not have a tear in your eye, this movie will be lost on you. But most people will know what that moment means to this family, and value it. By the end of the movie, I did care about these people, and I think that most of the audience will also.",The Family Stone

I felt that the movie did not do enough to grasp the entire audiences attention, only those that would sympathize without any provocation. To put it simply, unless you're one with a disposition to enjoy movies about 30-50 year old women trying to get a guy, you aren't going to like this movie.The Family Stone had potential, but it lost what charm it could have had in the beginning by being boring, drawn out, and predictable. The comedy is mediocre at best, and the emotions seem forced at some points.Sarah Jessica Parker does a good job with the script she was provided. Mr. Wilson does an excellent job, but he always does.",The Family Stone
359,MoiMoi7920,"Good, but not great",7,3 January 2006,"When I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought that it was the last movie I would ever choose to see. However, it was the only thing that seemed even the slightest bit appealing to me when I learned that ""The Chroncies of Narnia"" and ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" were not playing at my local movie theater.I had no idea that there was going to be any sentimental value to the movie at all, and a family at Christmas seemed highly uninteresting to me. I was wrong about that. I was pleasantly surprised that there was actually a plot and emotion. And as promised in the trailer, there were moments that had me laughing, too.It was all very predictable though. A friend whispered to me towards the middle of the film that she thought Ben & Meredith and Everett & Julie were going to end up together. And she was right! It seemed that there was a little too much pairing off, and I was bored by the romance between Amy & Brad. It would have been better if they just focused on one of the romances. But I did enjoy the others.On the positive side, all of the characters seemed well-developed and unique (Amy and Ben were my personal favorites). The actors did a terrific job, and I recognized a lot of faces.I think they could have done more with Sybil being ill. I never got it clear exactly what was wrong with her, and at the end of the movie when it was apparent that she had died I didn't even come close to shedding a tear. Even when all of the other characters were crying about it I found that I wasn't touched at all. I think that Sybil should have been a more central character and a bit more interesting if I was expected to care about her.This movie exceeded my expectations, but then again, my expectations weren't so high in the first place. It was good overall, although I don't think that it's one of those movies I will be wanting to watch over and over again.",The Family Stone

I enjoyed it even though it was a bit slow. This movie has too many scenes where the family is sitting/standing around talking for a child or most teenagers to enjoy. There were quite a few teenagers in the theater that were bored out of their minds (unfortunatly I had a couple of them in the row behind me), so they were text messaging their friends and talking about how boring the movie was while shifting around in their chairs a lot.This is a movie that is not too unlike ""Tears of Endearment"" starring Shirley Mclain in regards to the amount of drama scenes and lack of action. I liked both movies but not enough to recommend them to my friends. The movie would be better off enjoyed at home.I love Sara Jessica Parker, but boy was her character annoying in this movie. I physically cringed at quite a few of her scenes.",The Family Stone
361,adisen,Not all it seems to be from the preview,3,21 January 2006,"I really did not enjoy this movie. There were small parts where a little chuckle came about, but very few. It was a mismatched story line, one minute centering around the rejection of SJP and then the next a massive blow of the mothers cancer and her life at stake!! It did not go. And then for both brothers to in a sense swap girls, it would never ever happen, as anyone with sisters or brothers would know... Revenge is the only thing when a sibling takes ones partner. Overall a dodgy film!! I went in search of a comedy and left 5 minutes earlier because of the stupid series of last events.

Also, a lot of us are sick of the paint by numbers, cookie cutter, formulaic tripe they keep churning out.It is not difficult for me to stretch my imagination, however there is no conceivable way that I can see Everett (Dermot Mulroney's character) falling for Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker) even for a moment. The stick is just too far up her butt. The way she behaves at dinner regarding Everett's gay, deaf brother (what's wrong, couldn't give him a club foot, too?) and his black boy friend is despicable. If Meredith were a 70 year old man from the south 30 years ago, I could maybe believe it. She is however an intelligent metropolitan woman in around forty....not buying it. Also Julie (Claire Danes) is her sister? Please these two could not have lived in the same house for more than 5 minutes. Yes, I have know many siblings who were much different from each other. This is too much.That said, the way Everett's family, especially Amy (Rachel McAdams), behaves towards Meridith is equally despicable....at least prior to that gay, black bashing dinner. The only character remotely likable is Ben, played by Luke Wilson. Then he does they unfathomable and ruins the experience further.",The Family Stone

Nicely done and magnificently acted. I then came on the IMDb site and am reading the comments. I'm amazed at the number of negative reviews and more surprised at the vindictive comments. Time and again I keep seeing the word liberal used in a disparaging manner and Hippie being thrown around in a derogatory way. The dislike of the homosexual son with a black partner was also a problem..at least portraying it was a problem to some. Some one even called it a political film. At first I was wondering if these people had even seen the film and henceforth could have explained nuances that seemed to escape them and then it hit me.... this is an intentional attack by the Christian right to discredit a movie that has a gay adoption and partner ship. It's that simple ladies and gentlemen..that exactly what's happening here. Watch it just to spite these probably well meaning but rather messed up people.PeaceRoyOld Hippie ;-)___________________________________ The one conspiracy theory I can always count on to be a lie is the one proposed by the government and main stream media. 9/11 and Weapons of Mass Destruction being perfect examples.",The Family Stone

Sarah Jessica Parker did an excellent job and as a result I will probably look around when anyone clears their throat. While some guys might dismiss it as a chick flick, I thought that most people (except kids) will be able to see something of their own families and the insanity of Christmas. It was once again great to see Diane Keaton acting as well as the long lost Craig T. Nelson, who may have landed the meatiest role of his career.

Even though it was predictable it was very enjoyable. Craig T. Nelson was very creditable as the dad as was Diane Keaton as the mom. Sarah Jessica Parker played a convincing prig and Luke Wilson was charming (and nice on the eyes) as ever.

It was not. It was instead a film about a girl who just can't seem to make her fiancée's family like her and who keeps acting weird and can't even make the audience feel sorry for her. Everything she does is wrong and her fiancée does nothing to help. Her fiancée's family is a ""non-traditional"" family with a gay deaf brother whose partner is a black man. They did not decide to use these characters for funny or particularly heartwarming scenes, but instead they decided to make several awkward scenes about gay rights, disabilities, and racism. These scenes seemed more forced than natural to me and I found it boring and annoying to have these issues so obviously alluded to. Maybe if I had been expecting this type of movie, I might have rated it higher.",The Family Stone

And let me tell you...all I want for Christmas is my two hours back! It's always a shame when a cast as wonderful as this can come together and be totally embarrassed by a horrid script and disappointing directing. The plot is contrived and forced(my brother and I both knew who was going to fall in love with whom by the end of the opening credits nearly), and it uses every possible cliché available concerning family dramas and love triangles. The only thing that sets it apart from a Lifetime holiday made for t.v. movie, is rather than give us a whole bunch of perfect people with no real flaws, we get a household full of rude jerks that have nearly no redeeming merits and by the end of the show, some of them could get hit by a bus and we wouldn't be phased. Some of the actors do a decent job, Craig T. Nelson, Luke Wilson, and Sarah Jessica Parker are a joy to watch when they're not letting the script derail them. If you're looking for a film where you can shut off your brain, allow every sappy violin strumming moment take you away and give in to schlocky holiday manipulation, than this movie is for you. Otherwise, save your dollars for Munich or Syriana. ~Danny",The Family Stone

If that happened in real life his ex girlfriend would have strung him up, and no self respecting sister would see a guy who dumped her sister less than 5 minutes ago. Even if the ex girlfriend was in bed with her ex boyfriends brother!!!!!! Preposterous nonsense, apart from Luke Wilson the acting was only average to boot.

371,abacan,Disappointing script,4,5 May 2006,"Sex in the City meets the Faukers is a fascinating concept, but spoilt by an unnecessarily complex and yet simplistic script. The token inclusion of a mixed race gay couple who adopt is just one 'darling' that should have been killed. Rather than supplementing, it diverts attention from the core story of a first son seeking to present the ideal marital partner to his large possessive family, at the emotionally charged time of a Christmas family reunion.The Family Stone is carried by the strength of the actors, particularly Sara Jessica Parker for whom the film is an ideal vehicle to reveal a different side of her Sex in the City role. Diane Keaton's self-indulgent performance is only saved by demise of her possessive maternal role, another darling that should have been killed.There are some hilarious moments, which reveal the unfulfilled promise of the central story line.",The Family Stone

It had a little something for everyone, and the ensemble cast seems as though they were completely made for each other. I have recently found myself becoming a major Rachel McAdams fan. Even though she played a nasty bitch in this movie, as she did in ""Mean Girls"", her character still had a certain likability. I thought she stole the show with her touch of vulnerability, combined with underhanded antics.In addition, I enjoyed the rough around the edges character Luke Wilson played as a polar opposite to his brother (Dermot Mulroney). Add in a nervous fiancé (Sarah Jessica Parker), an always out-spoken mother (Diane Keaton), and the beautiful Claire Danes, and you almost tend to forget the fact that this movie pulls your heart strings as well as makes you laugh.PS Is Claire Danes now on her way to becoming a new version of Meg Ryan?

It is engrossing and bittersweet, yes, but don't be mislead- It's not a comedy in the genre of ""Something about Mary"" or ""Meet the Parents""! Nope...more like ""The big Chill"" meets ""Home for the holidays"".This film makes the viewer feel very uneasy much like one felt for Jack in ""Meet the parents"". In fact, for every person out there that has had the misoportunity of meeting their current girlfriend/boyfriends' family at Christmas, and trying SO HARD to be liked and having the family just be jerks to them...ENJOY, because it's like you went back in time to that very day! The family in this movie all has dysfunctional ways, yet regardless of this makes the girl-albeit she is VERY uptight- a target for their unforgivable meanness to her. The way they treat her is deplorable, but it is depicted as ""funny""? Not much of a joke to me, since this was how I was treated by MY girlfriends' family! And I even made turkey soup for lunch - The perfect counterpart to Merideth making breakfast! And the whole ""gay"" thing? What? Am I supposed to NOT sympathize with Merideth when she questions the homosexual son and his lover at the table about them raising a baby together? The family went WAY over the top on her- and if it were me? I would have packed my bags gotten in the car, and left these psychos immediately!

375,nmccash,Had to review after I saw so many dislikes...,8,3 August 2019,"The Family Stone is about a lot of things. It's about the stress of the holiday season, the anxiety of meeting the family of your significant other for the first time, the quirkiness of every family. But this movie is very much about one thing:Mom.There are these interactions that the children have with their mom. And in each of these individual interactions, and near the end of the film a full-family interaction, there is a piano that plays a chord. The chord is always different depending on the child she is interacting with, but these scenes paired with the music signify so much. The chord is different because a mothers love for her children is individual but equal and it really drives the overall somberness of the movie.This movie is a rollercoaster. It's funny, it's heartwarming, it's sad, it can be uncomfortable. But ultimately, these scenes I reference earlier drive the meaning of it all. The Family Stone implies it's about a ring, but it's about the Family's Stone, the Rock, the center. Mom.",The Family Stone
376,dianalrichardson,Cannot comprehend how this garbage made it to the theater,1,14 July 2006,"I just finished watching this film on my On Demand. I had to rewind, stop, and start the movie 3 times because I thought OnDemand was deleting scenes. THAT'S how ridiculous, unbelievable, and choppy this movie is. I really thought we lost the first half-hour or so, because SJP enters the Stone family household, and they immediately hate her. I thought, oh, well we must have missed the huge lead-in to that. NO! There was no lead-in. The family just flat-out hated the girlfriend of their son for no reason at all. Once I realized we didn't miss the first few scenes, I knew this movie would be disastrous.It actually gets worse! The entire family is too large that by the end of it, I still couldn't figure out who was related to who (who was that 6 year old anyway????) They did not need such a large cast and I did not get to know ANY of the characters or get to like ANY of them at all, except Luke Wilson, who was sweet. (by the way, I have to call the actors by their real names and not their character's names, because I don't even think we were introduced to all of them by first name.) One of the women (I guess she was a daughter???) her husband showed up for a total of 16 seconds of the movie. The film is so degrading even though it is trying to be politically correct. They make such a huge scene around the deaf son and his black husband that it completely goes against whatever P.C. statement they were trying to make.I can't even get into how ridiculous and utterly disturbing the 2 romances are. And I forgot about the cancer!! That came out of left field. All of a sudden the evil mother has cancer, however we're still making SJP feel like crap because that's more important. This was an extremely inappropriate look at someone suffering from cancer. Besides that, it did not add to the plot line at all, and instead complicated the story even more so than I ever thought this mess could be complicated.This film is such a completely tangled mess of untied plot lines, undeveloped characters, and no real genre that it just leaves you feeling MAD you spent any type of money on it at all. I also feel sorry for Rachel McAdams and Luke Wilson -- I'm sure they regret their decision to act in this disaster after seeing the final product. Avoid at all costs.",The Family Stone

It was just different I guess. At the end I just felt like there should be something more. There seemed to be a lot of unfinished story lines or just aspects of the movie that could have been more or less part of the movie. I wanted to smack Everett. I know you can't help who you fall in love with, but your girlfriend's sister? He had every intention of asking Meredith to marry him until Julie showed up.

379,ibcnunabit,Utterly disappointing on every level and in every way.,1,25 June 2006,"Dialogue: stilted, phony-sounding, and unlike any natural speech I've heard. Also, the sign language used throughout the film seems a bit of a lame tack-on to ""add interest."" But even that is inconsistently used.Story line: Non-interesting, despite conflict. Takes forever to take off, slow and plodding, no really interesting interactions. Lots of really downer irrelevant plot add-ons that do not really advance the story.The characters: I mildly to strongly disliked all the characters in this film. They were all jerks and assholes to some degree except for the black guy (son's lover) and the deaf gay son (yes, deaf AND gay! Woohoo!), who are portrayed as near-angelic--but to the same degree were very bland and seemed to be mere tokens for showing how supportive and tolerant (and ""wonderfully ultra-liberal"") the rest of the family is supposed to be. Yet their (the family's) actions and words portrayed them as selfish, cruel, bitter, insensitive jerks in other ways. Then later they'll look serious and apologize, head bowed, and ""try to do the right thing."" Yawn.They were unlikeable and unsympathetic characters (with a couple of exceptions who were cardboard cutout ""token"" characters who generated no interest) and I could not care for any of them. They were all failed characters.Cinematography: overdone and wooden, with long, lingering shots of landscapes and the slickly over-produced style of a ""serious drama"" which didn't connect at all with the seemingly intended romantic-comedy subject matter.Soundtrack: serious-sounding, stodgy, semi-classical. Becomes syrupy sweet with all the violins going at times to try to up the romance, miserably failing. The music, dialogue, and events at times seem to grotesquely try to manipulate your feelings, unsuccessfully. Then it seems for awhile that the writers/director don't care what anyone thinks of the movie. Then blatant attempts to milk emotion again, but they're unprepared and fail.I waited for the comedy which was advertised, and it didn't appear. Instead it was overly-serious and stodgy about what should have been light scenes. Then close to the end it becomes a bit of a manic slapstick movie for a while to ""funny it up."" (It wasn't.) Meanwhile several characters act unconscionably towards their significant others in atrocious ways which are glossed over and ""made okay"" in the movie, but it shows them to be utter assholes.I love good romantic comedies, black comedies, slapstick comedies, screwball comedies, character dramas, realistic movies, stylized movies--but this one doesn't succeed at being any, but throws hints at being each at one time or another, but winds up an awkward mess that's unpleasant to watch and dreadful to listen to.This was one of the most awful movies I've had the misfortune to watch.

381,sophos234,So disappointing...the worst film I've EVER EVER seen,1,24 May 2006,"Watching this film was like shooting yourself in the head, having the spurting blood spell out ""The Family Stone"" in drippy writing, and then having to carry on living in complete agony and brain-deadness. I need to emphasise how shocked I am at the absurdly high average review rating, but I should qualify my comments with some evidence. I could probably do a minute-by-minute massacre of this film (yes, EVERY minute was worth a good napalming), but for the sake of the readers, I'll keep it brief, and in order of heinousness: 1)This film may have been sponsored by the KKK for the extent to which it manages to undermine good ""liberal"" qualities. The whole point of liberalism is accepting that people may have an opposing values to your own without thinking they should be hanged for holding such views. The family's unrealistically immediate hatred of Meredith and their cruel treatment of her when she has done nothing to actively offend them is totally incongruous with the pot-smoking Benetton models that formed the family. 2) Why in God's name would you want your child to be gay? Why would you actively WANT your child to be ANYTHING?? Its logically as bigoted to say that you wish for gay children as if you said you absolutely didn't want your children to be gay. You wish for happy children, regardless of their sexual orientation. 3)Sarah Jessica Parker was completely unable to break out of her Sex and the City character, which meant that when she was acting uptight, it seemed completely unbelievable. Her supposedly 'drunken' scene was some of the worst acting I've ever seen. It was like the popular girl at school being in a school play, acting drunk but not doing any of the embarrassing things (i.e. slurring, very BAD dancing) that would actually make the drunkenness realistic, for fear of looking bad. 4)Stupid formulae, which are completely condescending to the audience. e.g. At the beginning, Meredith = uptight = hair scraped back in bun...BUT at the end...Meredith = more relaxed/in love = hair loose and down 5)Horrible script trying to be like Royal Tenenbaums type of quirky but completely failing. Does any mother ever comment to a complete stranger that a certain guy has 'popped' her daughter's 'cherry' in front of said daughter? Come on. Why does laid-back Ben fall in love with Meredith - because he wants a challenge or because he dreams of 'being the snow' that Meredith shovels. Oooh how arty. Eat my shorts. 6)Meredith's sister and the fiancé are a pair of whores who think they're lives should mimic some stupid French novel where people fall in love over a schmaltzy story set in some country where people are foreign and therefore can be patronised (that would be us, viewer). And you can swoon over the fact that Meredith's sister is such a great person that she'll come to the Stone family home to comfort her completely terrorised sister - what a catch. Oh, except that she's a complete cow who takes her sister's fiancé (regardless of her three minute hesitation) and doesn't go out to see if her sister's OK when they hear her car crash in the driveway. Twice. Hmmmmm. (And her hair is far too shiny)So disappointing...the worst film I've EVER EVER seen",The Family Stone
382,frednizzy,This is NOT a comedy,3,19 June 2006,"Little ruins a film faster for me than when a film that has no funny lines, situations or characters is billed as a comedy. Before seeing this film, understand that it is a full-on DRAMA. If you come away finding a couple of things funny, great, but don't expect it.Beyond the fact that it isn't funny, I agree with others who say that the motivations for the characters make no sense. They seemingly do things just to do them. One character is mean to another just to be mean. The characters have no depth. The most flushed out characters are the gay couple. Speaking of which, I have some objections to the dinner scene that echoed one of the last Will and Grace episodes (or vice-versa). I'll just leave it at that, though, because I don't want to get into some big socio-political thing here.

There were gags that were set up, then never followed up (the whole clearing her throat thing); there was the ""Mother Dying of Cancer"" sub-story that was trotted out twice just for an emotional depth-charge (then again at the end), but never fully resolved; there were plot problems that were never explained (why did everybody hate the first sister and just love the second; why wouldn't Claire Danes go after SJP immediately after she ran out of the house); and finally there were developments that were too unbelievable (Dermot McWhatever falling for Claire Danes, and the other brother falling for SJP all within a weekend).Here's what I think happened: There were a lot of heavy hitters in this little picture, and I'll bet each of them were able to intimidate the director (or more likely, the producers) into ""tweaking"" their characters or the plot lines involving their characters in order to give them more screen time, make them more likable, give them the funniest punchlines, etc.And this is what happens when there are too many chefs stirring the pot. Any kind of unified vision for the picture is distorted and what you are left with is a bunch of good, beautiful actors in a piece of tripe like ""The Family Stone.""",The Family Stone

And you definitely would not be happy about it and let them get together. SJP's sister in this was more annoying than anything. I knew exactly what was going to happen as soon as she fell off the bus. I don't know why I wasted my time and watched it till the end. The only good part of this movie was the touching moment when SJP gave whatever his name's family that photograph. The rest of it was just stupid. Ugh.

Having ultra-liberal Parker play the part of the evil conservative was a stroke of genius as she, no doubt, knows the subject so well. Had negative ratings been available I would have assigned one to this movie. Totally predictable with the only redeeming quality being the winter scenery. Clayburgh is her usual character even more bitter and mean. The obligatory Gay couple tried to cover as many bases with race, physically challenged, and adoption all rolled into one ""couple"".

If I can still remember these feelings from 22 years ago, you know this movie can hit you hard. The trailer gives the wrong impression of what kind of movie this is. I was pleasantly surprised.

A family that's open with everything, they decide to hate Parker for absolutely no reason, except for the fact that Parker went out to lunch with Mulroney's sister (McAdams), who decided that Parker was too businesslike and decided to bear a hateful grudge against her. The family displays cruel callousness towards Parker to the point where it is simply unbelievable, as she has really done nothing wrong. However, to make the film more ""fun"", Mulroney decides to side with his family, and Parker decides that she'd rather date his brother (Wilson) instead. An absolutely awful movie.

392,mattbrockmd,The (Ultra-liberal and Absolutely Ridiculous) Family Stone,1,26 July 2006,"I thought it was going to be a fun ""goofy family"" type movie similar to Meet the Parents, Guess Who, etc. I was excited about the all-star cast. But 20 minutes in (about 1.5 hours ago), I was ready to turn it off. Here's why:1. Be prepared to see perhaps the world's most rude and crude family. Apparently the mother, Diane Keaton, was supposed to seem like the loving matriarch. But when you watch her humiliate her son's girlfriend, Parker, for being uptight (the ultimate sin) and tease her own daughter about the guy who ""popped your cherry"", you are disgusted by this 'loving rock of the family'. 2. Be prepared to see utterly ridiculous plot turns. I don't know what the screenwriter/director were thinking- its like they expected us to have the attention span of a 2nd grader. There are also so many lingering moments of silence with mesmerized characters staring off into the distance or into each other's eyes that it becomes a farce. I'll leave it at that, so I don't put in any spoilers.3. Be prepared to watch a thinly veiled lecture on same-sex relationships set against the wonder and warmth of Christmas. Forget about those pesky ""societal morals"" (you're just being uptight) and embrace love and happiness.4. Be prepared to watch some very talented actors and actresses try very hard to make it all seem believable, meaningful, and entertaining- and fall on their behinds to the tune of Toreador. If the movie was meant to show the joy of love and happiness (as I suspect it was), it fails badly. It loses its credibility very early and never comes close to regaining it. It is, for the most part, painful and frustrating to watch. My recommendation: watch as much as you can tolerate OR sit and make fun of it ala Mystery Science Theater.",The Family Stone

It is honestly one of the best I have seen for a while, a story about love, family, (mis)understanding, and about being true to yourself. There need to be more films like this that when one walks out of the theatre, one feels good inside, good about life, about people. The reason I did not rate this film as a 10 is because there were some things in the film that I felt did not need to be in it to make it the film it was.

Everett falls in love with her sister, yes, not STRAIGHT away, and maybe it's because he realizes she's everything Meredith is not, and she's got similar likes etc.so, all in all, it was an alright movie, bits could've been better or worse. although, i was a bit confused with the 'deaf' brother, he didn't quite seem deaf.... either he wasn't deaf (why were they signing then?) or they just screwed up the continuity.

Yes the whole family enjoyed this film - but only enjoyed ripping it to pieces in between the (very infrequent) moments where something actually happened... The characters lack that something to keep you interested or at least gain them some sympathy, and, as the viewer you find yourself wanting something bad to happen to them all. However, if you do like the characters played before by actors such as Mr ''Wooden-In-Average-Romantic-Comedy'' Dermot Mulrooney, or Mrs ''Yes-I-Can-Only-Play-One-Role'' Sarah Jessica Parker - this film could be for you! (And at least it is pretty short - saved it getting a one/two out of ten)I believe this film does have some kind of agenda (as aforementioned by other reviewers) but it never really hits home on any of the potential points that it could - it highlights them briefly and then moves on, scared of making an actual statement...In summary...

The story is completely unbelievable, painfully predictable, and so horribly undeveloped that the whole movie could be told in a 2 minute trailer.The addition of a gay relationship and breast cancer do not give this movie (a term used loosely here) any credibility. This is absolute pablum for the masses (note the predominance of positive reviews-does't anyone have an imagination anymore?

Everitt's family, collectively, is the character whose shortcomings evolve. Meredith is fine...to an extent, she's all of us when we go through meeting the family. I don't think we should hate the family because they are mean to her until the end of the movie. What kind of human race would we be if every element we ever faced lacked negativity? Don't we learn, grow, and gain strength from adversity? Ben Franklin was struck by lightning, but without that whole experience, we wouldn't have electricity (at least we would have had to wait for some other bloke to fry himself or herself). Anyway, what I'm saying is Meredith is not the character we're to feel sorry for. It's the family. And while the family is still the bad guy, we have to appreciate them for pretty much pushing the right couples together and dissolving an unsuccessful marriage before it began. And in the end, they all come around and learn to love each other. That's the point. We should find something in everyone to love, because time and understanding can dissolve first impression bias. Besides, quirky movies where everyone learns to love each other within the first day are fake, and who wants to watch another cookie cutter family love movie?

I think it was a shame the film did not study this more, showing how utterly hypocritical & awful this family was, yes they loved each other fiercely but their hostility to Meredith showed a lot more about them than her and it would have been great to see them realise that they were not nearly as warm & loving & open minded as they thought rather than the ending we got.

They - even the very mature parents! - proceed to treat this young woman with the most appalling rudeness, showing her zero hospitality and never hesitating to insult and humiliate her to her face. The situation and the characters are artificial and embarrassing. Of course, Diane Keaton, Craig T. Nelson and Claire Danes have the acting chops to pull these characters off, but the characters and the story are so hateful, who cares if the acting is good? In the end, it's all tied with with some improbable hook ups, the mom character dies of cancer - there's a sentimental pan to one-year-later so the audience can see how wonderfully it all turned out - and the moviegoer can gratefully get up an leave.

They, and he, use him to punish the Outsiders curiosity, clumsiness and any attempt made to get close to THE Family.Even when we finally are privy to the, I guess, motivation of some of the attitudes, it still doesn't justify this snotty families odious behavior. I felt bad for Meredith, was mystified by Mother Stone and Amy, was angry at Evrett for putting Meredith in that situation, didn't care for Meredith's sister, she was not very supportive, but I really disliked Thad for being the reason these people thought they were allowed to be uncivil to another son's friend.

I was extremely disappointed so much in Diane Keaton's role with the cancer that I could not rest that night. It brought back my own fears, having had a mother who passed away from BC and then myself being a RECENT cancer survivor, and so many other women I would imagine, who will be watching this movie. I can't imagine the director wanting to film this kind of an ending; albeit perhaps real in many situations, not all WOMEN WHO HAVE BREAST CANCER DIE! This is NOT the message I want to bring home to myself for healing or for any woman, with or without a blood family to entertain at the holidays. I have never minimized this illness as the movie did, and thought that was very unrealistic, unless they were living with their heads stuck in the ground, totally in denial of an important event unfolding with their mother. As O try to relax about cancer returning, it would serve people well to be given hope in any way possible with BC instead of seeing it as Terms of Endearment did or any other sad and upsetting ending.I know the world does not need kind of conclusion to what could have been a great movie; otherwise, I did like the characters and thought it was a good, though not realistic depiction of a family at Christmas -- especially with the swapping girlfriends and brothers thing, but i really felt upset that not only did we not focus on her breast cancer, but the end was tragic and shocking, dreaded and uncalled for to make a holiday smile with good cheer and hope. I think this director should be blacklisted for not seeing women need more hope than that, and Diane Keaton disappoints me by taking that role. She should have more power than that; the only way i will excuse her choice in this is if she really did have the mastectomy; then it would make more sense....but for her to portray a women with such a scar and such hopelessness, this was very upsetting to me, even though we all know death can ensue from this disease.",The Family Stone

There was no warmth to this family at all. The attempt to portray Diane Keaton as the cool Mom went down like a tonne of bricks - the word b*ch came to mind quicker.

But then it got weird. The sister just jumps on a bus at the last minute and shows up at these stranger's house for Christmas? And why did they welcome the sister with such open arms? I didn't mind that Meredith felt weird about sleeping with Everett at his parent's house, but why didn't they go to a hotel in the first place? Why did Thad and Patrick stay at a hotel? Where was the pregnant sister's husband the whole time? They never explained why he wasn't there to celebrate Christmas with his pregnant wife and daughter. I didn't mind that the mother didn't want Everett to marry Merideth, a girl they obviously didn't like or feel was right for him. Then it got even more improbable. Everett and Julie go out to look for Meredith, and they end up having a heart rendering conversation when they barely know each other? They didn't seem particularly concerned about finding her, either. Also, the town was portrayed as very small, it didn't seem like there were that may places Meredith and Ben could have gone that would have made them so hard to be found. Then, the bar scene, also very improbable. She's so uptight but gets so loose with Ben? What does Ben see in her? Then, really stupid, as Everett decides Julie's the one for him after knowing her for what, two days? I don't blame Meredith for choosing Ben over Everett because he seems so much nicer and warmer, but the uptight character she played at the beginning seemed more like the uptight character Everett played. Finally, why did they have to kill off the mom? Was that necessary? The more I thought about this movie, the more I hated it.",The Family Stone

418,njpandelos,Same Picture,8,18 January 2008,"I watched The Family Stone(2005) and loved it.Diane Keaton is a hilarious actress.She was also in the movie Because I said So (2007).In the movie The Family Stone, Jessica gave them her Christmas gift it was a picture of Miss Keaton's character holding a baby.In the movie Because I Said So, after Miss Keaton's character had a fight with her daughter she was looking at a picture of herself holding a baby.It was the same picture used in two different movies.Someone wasn't paying attention and allowed it to be used in each movie.I'm not nit picking but I just thought it strange to see the same picture used in two different movies.I would love to know who Miss Keaton was holding in the picture.It was really her when she was younger.",The Family Stone
419,giantspurs,What did I just watch?,1,27 January 2013,"Everything about this movie was try hard. Try hard doing what, exactly? Beats me. Was this a romance or comedy? Personally, I found it neither amusing nor romantic. The movie centers around the family Stone who are a (supposedly) liberal, diverse, close knit, family. In reality, they're annoying with their judgmental thinking and close to bullying behavior.They seem to direct all this hate and hostility towards Jessica Parker's character, Meredith. Meredith is Everett's (Dermot Mulroney) girlfriend whom with the exception of the daughter/sister (Rachel McAdams) they have NEVER met but they're all immediately in agreement that they don't like her even though the film never gives any reason or motive for the disapproval other than the fact that she's different from them but that shouldn't be a problem because this is the family that believes an acceptance of diversity, right? My a**! Meredith's character is obviously not comfortable and almost stoic in their presence but at no time is she disrespectful nor does she give them any reason to be treated in such a rude manner.In the middle of all of that, there's a son (Luke Wilson) who hooks up with Meredith, gross, I know but don't worry Claire Dane's character, Meredith's sister, shows up to even out the WTF?!, there's a gay, deaf, son whose partner is black, a pregnant daughter who was used mostly for props because she had no story to tell (at least no story that I cared to know about), and the father who also plays absolutely no valuable role in this film. Actually, the one time he had a role in this film he becomes unlikable with his uncalled for yelling.There's a scene that sums up the hate, ridiculousness, and oddity of this entire film. They're having dinner and the the conversation centers around the future adoption of the very judgmental gay brother and his black partner. It transitions into sexual orientation and a simple nature vs nurture question by Meredith that sets everyone off. The way she went about it could be viewed as insensitive but never cruel intended especially when she then continually attempts to apologize and explains that she didn't word it correctly but that's irrelevant because at this point they're searching for any reason to attack her. The father yells at her. Yes, he YELLS! She runs off and the gay son has his head down with a frown as if he were a baby who had never in his life been insulted or faced criticism in his entire life. Did I mention he's a gay, deaf, guy? The mom (Diane Keaton) interrupts Meredith's sister who for the first time throughout the film attempts to defend and support her sister only to say: ""I love you. And you are more normal than any other... asshole sitting at this table. OK?"". Yes, Keaton just called Meredith an asshole in front of her sister for a simple misunderstanding and no one at the table including the sister nor boyfriend saw anything wrong with this?",The Family Stone
420,miggy-johnson,Hypocrites...yes...but realized,9,28 June 2008,"While I do agree that the family was very hypocritical, I think that that is where the charm of the movie comes in. They have become such a closely knit family that it has turned them into an elite-est group of people that no one who seems the least bit 'unfit' can break into. So they get so caught up in any problems or joys that their own family has, they forget that other people have their own problems and joys too. Sarah Jessica Parkers character rocks the boat by entering and desperately trying to fit in, but ending up putting her foot in her mouth every time (whether by her own doings or by being tricked by the youngest daughter who hates her). By the end of the movie though, I think that the family has come to realize what they've done and that they shouldn't be so quick to 'throw stones' ,as it were, at others when they live in a glass house themselves. And I think that Sarah Jessica Parkers character came to realize that, try as she might, she wouldn't be able to fit into whatever box that the family would set up for her, so in the end she had to let go and trust in herself. Both the family and Sarah Jessica Parker learned that sometimes you have to come together through your different personalities and maybe sometimes learn to be your own person, even around a group of people with such a strong personality.I thought that this was a great movie about a family who was very progressive...but maybe to the point of becoming exclusive and elite, and how their elite-ism could have become their downfall.",The Family Stone
421,alexander_walsh,Please Enjoy,9,24 December 2008,"I think the movie was great. When I saw it in theaters originally, I was forced to see it and didn't like it as much. Since then, however, I have seen it many times and I think it's a great character based film. There is so much to see in it that you only get by seeing it many times. In one scene in particular, the two brothers, Everett and Ben, look at one another without even saying much at all, and yet, their non-verbals say everything. The shot lasts for about three or four seconds, but it may be one of the best ones in the film. Every character is one you want to root for (some more than others, though) and even the smallest details give you insight into these people's lives. When the father drags the sun away after he wakes up with his brother's girlfriend, when the two brother's fight turns into laughing and roughhousing, when the oldest sister realizes her mother's illness It was all written very well. A lot of time went into the making of this film, and I think a lot of people didn't really give it a chance because they expected it to be a romantic comedy when it was really a family drama. We can blame the advertising for that.As for the bad reviews of this film: Please do not take everything they say seriously. When people see a movie they do not like, they are more apt to write bad reviews. Those who liked this film probably fell asleep on a couch in front of a fire as the end credits rolled across the screen. I do understand, though, the complaint about how much changed in a 24 hour period within the movie. In this story, though, I think it was believable. I mean, a lot can change in a single moment alone. When the son brought his girlfriend home, he already knew in the back of his mind that he wasn't meant for her. It wasn't an entire life changing moment. He just needed something the push him to his realization. That came in a day. (Also, must we forget that this film jumped to a year later? A lot can happen in a year.Understanding change like this will help you to enjoy films that may not have originally been your cup of tea, and, in turn, will help you enjoy life more. Attacking a movie is like attacking a chocolate fudge sundae (I believe Kurt Vonnegut said something like that).Those who liked this film were happy letting this film simply entertain them for a few hours of their life. Please let it do the same for you.",The Family Stone
422,justintime_2,A chaotic mess.,1,15 December 2019,I liked the film up until the dinner scene when Meredith's character completely did a 180. It was badly written and made no sense. The family was already a band of jerks and the writer jacked up the only decent character.,The Family Stone
423,dcostil,it is an ensemble piece focusing on Christmas holiday misadventures,5,15 February 2009,"I watched this movie recently on television and liked it. It is a chick flick with some quirky comedy relief scenes.Overall it is the same traditional going to see the whacky boyfriends family for the holidays a lot of movies and books have done. I think of Cher's Moonstruck and Steel Magnolias as other movies of this nature with similar themes.Wikipedia has a nice writeup about this movie.I thought Claire Danes was the most natural of the actors. Sarah Jessica Parker's role reminded me of her Sex in the City work. The rest of the actors seemed tired.I discuss some parts of the movie below. Those wanting to see the movie might want to watch the movie before reading on....There is a bit of confusion with the ending of the movie because it fails to inform that the finale is the second (next) Christmas holiday and not the same holiday that makes up most of the movie. The first holiday begins with the arrival of Thad and Patrick. The second holiday begins with the arrival of Thad and Patrick and the baby.There is an old tradition in New England of draping the pictures of one who has passed on in black. People from other parts of the country may not know this. The photo going from a white mat earlier on to a black mat is not a ""goof"".",The Family Stone
424,abdawg78790,Worth seeing.,9,10 January 2010,"You might be asking, why could a person want to watch this movie more than once or even the whole way through? The truth is, I don't know, but this movie is definitely one of the many movies that I watch more than once at Christmas time. I enjoy this movie as does most of my family. It's the story of a family dealing with what life throws at them which sounds cheesy and like every other dumb Hollywood B movie out there. I can't really tell why I like this movie or what makes it so great for me to watch it every year, I just do. Yes, this movie is rude, yes at times it can be vulgar, and yes they most likely could have left all of that out of the movie, but it just wouldn't be the same, especially for me. It could have been a boring Christmas movie full of cheer and happiness, but that would be a lying movie that didn't tell the full story of Christmastime. At times, all of the characters are annoying, I hate them at some times, but then I love the characters. One thing I don't like about some of the reviews on IMDb is that they all don't like the character Diane Keaton plays. Her character adds to the movie and without her character the movie would almost certainly be a bust. Another thing I don't like is the bombarding of the kitchen table scene. This is most likely my favorite scene in the movie other than the ending scene. This is a crucial characterization moment for most of the characters. What Keaton's character was trying to explain was that she wanted her children to be gay so that they would stay with her forever or that she would be the only important woman in her children's lives. She simply loved her kids. What Parker's character was trying to do was create a conversation much like the one that her sister had made concerning the race of the men's baby. She wanted to do the same thing her sister had done but had created a completely out-of-hand conversation in the making. Yet another part of the film that was criticized by the members of IMDb was the fact that none of the characters changed a bit throughout the whole movie. This is untrue, and if the members had watched the whole movie and paid attention without bias they would have seen that by the end of the movie, Parker's character was brought in to the family and was dating Ben at the end scene. None of them seemed to dislike the fact and a Christmas was had entirely without argument. When the picture of Diane Keaton and Rachel McAdams was given by Parker to the family, it was taken by myself to be a reconciliation. I hope that most people that see this review can take the movie as it is without bias. I own this movie and plan to watch it this year near Christmastime at least four times.",The Family Stone
425,rowingb-1,What a total waste of time.,3,9 January 2016,"Dreadful, dreadful film. Very stilted script with idiotic scenes. Scenes that should have been poignant patently were not. The pregnant pauses where we know what the character should be saying to sort the situation out are not made full use of. This could have been done so much better. You don't empathise with the characters because they are so spiteful to the favoured son's slightly uptight girlfriend. Someone who has been brought to the family home for what should be a joyous occasion, Christmas. I don't understand why the boyfriend didn't warn her what the family was like and he obviously didn't love her as he didn't follow her out once she became distressed and left the house. He just mooned about like a wet week and it was left to the brother who did have a spine to corral the girlfriend, calm her down and bring her back into the fold. Finally it descended into slapstick when the writers couldn't think of anything else to do with the script. All in all a waste of the incredible acting talent that it attracted.",The Family Stone
426,drnommy,Delightful and resonant,9,9 January 2006,"This story of a tense, and self-conscious young woman meeting her prospective in-laws for the first time would go on any top ten list I would ever care to create. I feel sorry for the multitude of critics who can only focus on this movie's embrace of sentiment, broad comedy, and occasionally contrived situations. But the contrivances are both necessary and acceptable in the service of larger aims, and the depictions of family tensions, especially those experienced around the holiday season, are the most painfully recognizable, yet sympathetically and humorously depicted I've ever seen. Their effect is to show us that even the most wounding family crises can also be, at heart, transformative, and in retrospect, even funny.The performances are top-notch all around, the script is superlative, and the direction is energetic and assured. The sentiment so derided by critics, I think realistically and at times, uncomfortably depicts us both at our best and at our worst, and I was often crying, laughing, and cringing at the same time -- not an easy trick. The theater was packed, and the people around me were having similar responses. You must approach this movie with a willingness to let go and honestly feel whatever you feel for a couple of hours. If you're looking for an intellectual chat, perhaps this movie is not for you. But if you're looking for a smart, entertaining, and honest look at family traditions and idiosyncrasies -- their downsides as well as their upsides -- and if, as I do, you adore great acting and great writing -- then you'll love this movie.",The Family Stone
427,girgern,Love this movie,10,7 October 2009,"if you are an ordinary people who need simple but funny movie to release your daily routine and to entertain yourself , this is exactly the movie for you. Some spoilers says stone family is horrible and some say hypocrite but what i see is they really care for each other and very supportive. Meredith the one who have attitude problem at first place. As the first time guest she should not critic the way Sybil raise up her children. I don't think she want to have a gay or abnormal child in her family too but its happen, and she try to show to his son that he is same like other child even more special even though he is deaf or gay. And Meredith with her annoying ""non stop talking"" attitude killing all the people happy mood with her clever speech. As a clever and successful women she should understand the situation already. Meredith have one attitude problem that when she start talking she can't even stop, which i think its very rude especially when older people asking him question, she just ignore and continue her story..to me Meredith attitude is annoying.As the mother Sybil already see that Everett and Meredith didn't belong together, most all the family can see that too. And Sybil doesn't want Everett to make mistake to his life [ and she's not there for him when that's happen ]. So obvious Everett doesn't know how to handle and comfort her like Ben did. Everyone knows Amy is a ""bad sister"". Even the father also said she look nice when she;s sleep. Every big family it's normal to have 1 naughty one like Amy, i think.Overall i think this movie is entertaining. I can laugh loudly for some parts and feel touchy for other part too. I just bored with stereo type of comedy that using curse words or sex as an object and i can't even laugh with spoof comedy anymore. This movie is perfect for me, its watchable from beginning till the end. I comment as ordinary people who need some entertainment, i don't need heavy drama or complicated stuff. This is just simple, mind release and heart warming too.",The Family Stone
428,pannekaken,Don't waste your time on this crap!,1,1 January 2011,"I just watched this movie on TV and what a total waste. It was so bad I didn't even watch the rest. I usually watch everything even though I think it's bad, but I couldn't stand this one. I saw the trailer and thought this movie must be O.K with that kind of cast no actor/actress can save this disaster. I seriously disliked every minute of this movie. The story and characters were unbelievable, unrealistic the whole thing just made me angry. I didn't watched the whole movie, but I read about the ending, and it was just as I though it would be, it sucked. The fact the Julie ended up with Everett, and Meredith ended up with Ben is ridiculous! Julie which supposed to be this caring and supporting sister didn't even check on her sister when she stormed out crying and crashing the car twice outside of the house. Everett the boyfriend, did not go after his girlfriend, but his brother Ben did. Then Everett and Julie go outside together ""looking for Meredith"" (after they all finished dinner and Julie was reading some book to some kid on the couch like she been in the family for ages) which turns out to like they are on a date walking around the town, instead of actually looking for Meredith If I wrote about all the bad things in this movie it would take me forever. I have never been so mad after watching a movie that I didn't finish watching. I just had to write my frustration somewhere, and I want to warn everybody that haven't watched this crap yet.

431,heidi092981,"skip it...watch ""Home for the Holidays"" instead",2,8 December 2005,"Many of the characters are cliché and are schizophrenic from scene to scene. Many of their actions don't make sense within the movie or with regards to their characters. They only do what they do because you can tell that's just what the director wanted to happen, so he made it so. And many of the things that happen between the characters and in the story are just too easy, far-fetched, awkward and unrealistic. Why should we believe that the two sisters would end up with the different brothers?! This takes the audience out of the movie and by the end you just don't care or believe any of what is happening. Also, it seems as though the director just read a book on how to write a script and then sat down to write ""The Family Stone."" Come on, it is so obvious and unoriginal to tie Sarah Jessica Parker's character's hair back in a tight bun when she is being uptight and cold at the beginning of the movie. And then as soon as she loosens up a little with Luke Wilson's character she takes down her hair and it's down for the rest of the movie! If the family is supposed to be this loving, open-minded bunch, why do they all immediately hate SJP's character before meeting her? Rachel McAdam's character is the only that should feel that way due to her condescending attitude. Watch ""Home for the Holidays"" instead (which ""The Family Stone"" took many plot/character points from). ""Home for the Holidays,"" has a much better script, is better directed and the characters and their actions are much more heartfelt, funny and realistic.",The Family Stone

It starts off bad and quickly becomes predictable drivel. What was the inspiration behind a deaf homosexual...I mean what did he do to advance the plot other than make for some awkward moments now and again. Then there's the main female character, Meredith, who had a pole shoved so far up her backside that I'm surprised she could sit down at all. To be honest though, one of my biggest complaints about this movie would have to be what was it? Was it a comedy? Was it a drama? Was it a romance? If it was a comedy it failed miserably, if it was a drama then it was just depressing and if it was a romance you don't exactly feel all happy at the end of the film. If you are looking for a good movie then you might want to look elsewhere, if however you are like me and enjoy bad movies then put this in the player soon and you won't be disappointed.",The Family Stone

Although I realize this is not an award winning movie, it is worthy of seeing. I rented this back when it first became available and I wasn't very impressed. However, after catching it again on cable I appreciated it much more. Many describe the the movie as an uptight girl meeting a liberal family and having it go very wrong. But the truth is that this movie is actually about a dying mother and the way her family deals with it. It really does pack an emotional punch. In particular there is scene with the pregnant daughter watching an old Judy Garland film with ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" playing that is honestly one of the most touching scenes I've ever seen in a movie. This is about life's upsets and how you respond to them. Each character is flawed, making them real. And each character feels their way through the emotional damage that the prospect of losing a parent brings. Say what you will about this film, but it has substance that what most of the reviewers are unwilling to give it credit for.

Look, I never write these things and I was so mad that I had to come home and write about this and to see what other people thought.

439,ksreinke,"Rich family relationships, expertly drawn, with believable and requisite humor, angst, pettiness, and love",8,17 December 2005,"One of the best adult ""family"" films I've seen, period. What a treat to go to a movie expecting a light romantic comedy and to find an infinitely richer dramatic essay on complex family roles and relationships,parental love, sibling loyalty, and the search for true identity! I was impressed by the realistic portrayal of each unique sibling/sibling and parent/child relationship in the movie. Each character was so precisely and believably drawn. The actors did a wonderful job of conveying the subtlest connections and gestures, and the writer did such a wonderful job of forging these connections. From Diane Keaton's acerbic, witty, and emotionally attached matriarch to Rachel MacAdams' acerbic, witty, and emotionally DEtached youngest daughter. From Craig T. Nelson's kind-hearted, generous, and astutely observing patriarch to Luke Wilson's kind-hearted, generous and astutely observing second son. The fact that these family parallel personalities/characters were attempted and represented with such dexterity blew me away. And Rachel MacAdams, as Amy, WAS Diane Keaton's daughter throughout the movie. Luke Wilson WAS Craig T. Nelson's son. In each case, I ""got"" the character, which made their pain and humor all the more bitter-sweet and relevant.The only issues that gave me pause were the casting of Mulrony as the eldest brother, and the character development of the Morton sisters. From a writing and acting standpoint, I thought Everett was cleverly and subtly portrayed - as a perfectionist eldest sibling myself, I actually identified quite a bit with his desire to succeed and please. However, I think that Mulrony was probably 5-8 years too old for the part. In my mind each of the Stone siblings were two to three years apart. From the youngest daughter Amy, (24) to Thad,(27) to Susan,(30), to Ben,(33) This would make Everett 35-36, and Mulrony looks much older. I know its a nit-picking point, but in light of how well everything else is handled, it seemed a shame. Both of the Morton sisters, played by SJP and Claire Danes, were well written, and again, well acted. I just found it less believable that these two characters were actually sisters. Unlike the Stone family, they didn't seem to share many character traits or have much in common.Fortunately, these issues did not distract from the larger fact that this was a beautifully nuanced and intelligently written and acted story of a family going through life and everything it throws at them. Bravo to everyone who made this movie possible. I am recommending it to all my friends (and siblings!)A quick side note - I loved the music! Each featured song was pitch perfect, and refreshing. And I, unlike many critics, did not think the scenes and song from ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" were cliché.

440,gravelleamy,My favorite Christmas movie ever!!,8,23 December 2020,"I absolutely LOVE this film! The cast, the plot, the cinematography, the set..EVERYTHING. The Stone family was flawed in many ways, but there is a love between them that shines through the imperfections. The acting is superb, starting with Diane Keaton as Sybil, the matriarch. Sybil knows this is probably the last Christmas with her children, and she shares some emotionally wrenching scenes with them throughout the film. Craig T. Nelson was also superb in his role of family patriarch, Kelly. An emotional, caring man, whose only Christmas wish is to give his children and wife a happy last Christmas together. This film always makes me cry, as the superb acting and writing make you feel the emotional struggles of the characters, and you can deeply empathize with each situation. This movie is highly underrated in my opinion, and should be a more regarded Holiday film. It checks every box of emotion, and provides the viewer with a fun, Christmassy feel despite the heavy subplot. If you haven't seen this film, give it a shot.My favorite Stone children were Ben and Amy by the way. I could see myself in both characters.",The Family Stone
441,blondie360,One of the worst films of the year,1,15 November 2005,"I saw this film last week as part of a screening and discussion series in my city. ""The Family Stone"" is charading itself as a family holiday dramedy. It is none of these things. The concept of it being a family and holiday film is so skewed. First of all, the Stone family is presented as an open, loving, and quirky family... yet from the start are nothing but a family of isolationists afraid to accept anyone new into their family. Sarah Jessica Parker's character is also presented as a cold, self absorbed executive who is so ""crushed"" that her boyfriend's family doesn't liker her, but yet does nothing to change their impression of her. You'll be in shock during the Christmas Eve dinner scene. I had hopes for this film, considering its stellar cast. However, the characters are very underdeveloped- you can't sympathize or laugh with them because they're so vacantly played. The film's one and only funny scene is a short slapstick scene that is too little, too late to save this film. And because no one likes a downer for the holidays, all the story lines are wrapped up into a neat little package for the end. The film's one saving grace is the film's honest portrayal of how normal gay couples are. This kind of view is rare in today's time, what with the attempts to demonize gays and make their unions illegal, and is a very important statement to make. Again, this was not enough to save this film. There is nothing cute, charming, or deep about ""The Family Stone.""

Each character attacks Meredith without giving her a chance in an unrealistic way, very judgemental characters who are trying to come acrossmas liberal. Poor characterisation. But what makes this film diabolical is the way that after only just meeting the brothers switch partners and we are supposed to believe that professional Meredith would end up with waster Ben and Julie would so quickly jump into a relationship with her sister's cast off.This film should never have been made.

To be honest, I did not see the end (I could not finish it), but I assume that I did not miss much. Everybody is so mean to the poor fiancée, Meredith, who desperately tries to be kind! Even her sister, called in to ease the bullying, can't care less! The scenario is so sick, I'm wondering about the mental health of the writer. Poor Diane Keaton, she must have been desperate to accept such a role in such a movie. At the dinner, on Christmas Eve, when the topic is on homosexuality (one of the son is gay), the mother says how she would have liked all of her sons to be homosexuals so she could have kept them for herself. Meredith then tries to know if she really means that, and tries to explain how usually parents don't wish this because to be homosexual certainly must not make life easier? Of course, everybody reacts as if she disapproves of it, and believe me, she is in for a damn ride of bullying. This was so unreal! She desperately tries to explain to them the real meaning of what she said (which by the way was so easy to understand), but no one, not even her fiancé, tries to understand. This scene was so disgusting, as really was the entire movie. It left me with an incredibly sad taste.",The Family Stone

Now imagine being told by your fiance about those liberal, big hearted parents and finding out it is a lie and that nothing you do or say will please them. So you try harder and fail bigger every time.Now imagine you're successful in your professional life and think you and your fiance are on the same page and he will have your back. You're wrong. You're in a hostile environment from the moment you cross the threshold of an armed camp and all the guns are pointing at you and your fiance doesn't have your back. In fact, he seems ambivalent about the entire thing. You're on your own against a group of petty people quick to find fault and happy to escalate every situation to make things worse.So you call in reinforcements. Your sister comes and she speaks the language of the enemy and they love her, they love her so much that the fiance you put your trust in ends up with her. Isn't that romantic? No. It isn't. It's creepy. Now throw in the stoner brother who you end up with and that's your Christmas. Fortunately, by the next Christmas the matriarch of the entire clan is dead of cancer, which shouldn't shift the dynamic of a family so much but, apparently, it does and EVERYONE seems happier.I still give it a 4 because the setting looks nice and the production values are good and the actors are working off the deeply flawed script adequately but I dislike this film very much. At no point in production did anyone look at the script and think, ""I don't like anyone in this film.""",The Family Stone
445,mmijic,excellent,10,30 December 2005,"Warm, funny, and intelligent. The audience (in Sacramento, CA) was roaring with laughter.It has one of the best directing/editing jobs seen in recent movies, never a dull moment, or slowdown. Reaction shots, the pace of the action, the quick changes of atmosphere from laughter, to serious, to tears, were all superb.Has excellent cast and excellent acting. Good movie to see in this holiday season, and I am sure it will have a long life on cable and DVD.A comment about other reviews. All negative connotation reviews that I have seen seem to be focused on its sympathetic portrait of a gay couple, which is both well done as part of the movie, much as it is part of life, not its focus, and just one part of it anyway, like 1/5 or 1/8, depending how you count the main characters.Also, the comparisons with ""Meet the Parents"" or ""Royal Tannenbaums"" are totally superficial. By the same logic they could have compared it with the Brady bunch or Judging Amy. This movie is defined by its interesting characters and their interactions, it grows from inside.",The Family Stone
446,katherineraz,"One of the Hands-Down, Worst Films I Have Ever Seen",1,15 October 2006,"SPOILERS WITHIN:For some reason I thought this movie would be similar to The Royal Tenenbaums - a story about a lovable, charming, quirky, odd family coming into contact with an uptight professional wardrobe queen. Excellent set up, right?But the movie starts going downhill from the very first minute, never gets better, and left me wondering why all these otherwise decent actors chose to associate themselves with such an awful, awful script.Nothing that happens in this movie makes any sense. Now, for something to ""make sense"" in a movie, it doesn't have to be ""realistic."" You can believe a winged dragon is going to jump in and save the day at the very end as long as - and this is key here - that point is set up earlier in the script. By establishing characters' motivations and history, the audience will slowly clue into the crux moments of the script where those characters have to make decisions - based on their past experiences - that influence the outcome of the film.There wasn't one character in this movie that had any background information established before they started making ""key"" decisions. Things happened, and the audience watches, uninterested, because from the very beginning of the film we aren't given any reason to care.The Stone family hates Durmot Mulroney's fiancée, played by SJP. The audience has no idea why, because the film never sets up any organic reason for it. The characters merely EXPLAIN reasons they don't like her, which does not a movie make.Halfway through the film we're clued into the fact that mom has cancer. If this was supposed to be a pinnacle moment, it merely further confuses the plot, as the audience is left wondering why, if someone in the family were about to die, everyone would be so trifling and petty.Enter Claire Danes. Again, for no reason. From the moment she clumsily falls off the bus line that drags her into the Stones' life, acting as the complete opposite of her uptight sister, we see the plot ""thickening"" so obviously that I was tempted to fast forward through the obligatory sentimental conversations that had to follow, wherein Durmot Mulroney sees Danes' sensitive side (""I'm an art grant writer... and this totem pole touched me so deeply."")It's almost an afterthought that he falls in love with Danes, Luke Wilson marries SJP, and the next Christmas everyone lives happily ever after except mom whose dead (but who really cares anyway).What made this movie especially bad was the ""Home Alone""-esquire music that forced joviality at moments when the Stone family was trifling, a horrible section of Christmas-gone- horribly-awry pratfalls (wherein the entire family gets covered in eggs and turkey in the kitchen, ha ha ha).However, the hands-down worst part of this film were the shallow characters. Diane Keaton's mother was defined by coffee: she had a favorite mug and she hated it when people took the last coffee and didn't make more. Rachel McAdams (as the sister) was supposed to be a liberal college-type, but was nothing except a basketful of laundry and an NPR logo gives this away. (Otherwise she's just a petty brat.) Luke Wilson's character is utterly confusing - at first he's rather creepy (forcing his affections on SJP), then he's a pot- head with a Love and Rockets poster in his room, then he's a doting husband.And worst of all is Durmot Mulroney, whose character development (or lack thereof) the movie centers on. What we finally begin to understand, only through horrible dialog, is that The Family Stone doesn't want Durmot Mulroney to marry SJP because he isn't being ""true to himself."" If this would have been at all clear in any kind of set-up to the movie, perhaps, perhaps The Family Stone could have had a bit of redemption. As it is, it did not, and therefore this movie is one of the absolute worst films of all time.",The Family Stone

Cryptic messages you have to decipher to understand the characters motivations and actions. You really need to go in there with your thinking cap on. At the end of the movie there is a lot left unanswered and unexplained, and it seemed more like it was a 4 hour movie they were told to drastically edit. Wait for the DVD so you can see the deleted scenes, because I'm sure there's about 2 hours worth.Luke Wilson and Rachel McAdams are great comedic actors - and by that I don't mean in the Eddie Murphy/Chris Rock/Whatever sort of way - just like that really funny friend everyone has, the kind you always want to be around because you can never be sad.Be prepared for some drama, some ridiculous love matches, and lots of unexplained one-liners (NOT the comedic variety).

I don't know. The same can be said for Meredith falling for Ben. Plus the time scale is all messed up! How can this all happen in a couple of days?

459,kashea-4,The worst movie I have ever seen,1,25 December 2005,"This is the only movie I have ever walked out of. It is absolutely unwatchable. Sarah Jessica Parker is the would be daughter-in-law of this rude, obnoxious family headed by Diane Keaton (who is playing the same character she's played her whole life) and Craig T. Nelson. For some unexplainable reason, the entire family treats Sarah Jessica Parker like absolute garbage. They make fun her, and flat out tell the son not to marry her. The son asked Diane Keaton for the family wedding ring and Diane Keaton tells him ""no, tough s***."" Wow. Again, there is no reason the family shouldn't like Sarah Jessica Parker at this point. Rachael McAdams character is a vile piece of trash. A rude little brat. It isn't funny. Diane Keaton should've slapped her for the way she acted. No mother would approve of Rachael McAdams actions. Yet for some reason, Diane Keaton is yucking it up with her. There is no reason to like this family. Then they say that the mom is sick. Again, why would anyway care? They are painted like total jerks, so I don't care if one of them is sick.THEN, the worst part. They are all talking at the dinner. Diane Keaton says she ""wishes all her sons were gay"" (because one of them is). OK, well that is a pretty weird thing to say. It's not funny or charming, its just stupid. So then Sarah Jessica Parker says ""you didn't really wish that, did you?"" And then she goes into some ridiculous diatribe about how 'no one would want their child to be gay. Everyone wants a 'normal'' child. Now granted, that is a pretty dumb thing to say in front of a gay couple. So then Diane Keaton and Craig T. Nelson go crazy and Diane Keaton calls Sarah Jessica Parker an ""asshole"". Then I walked out of the theatre. Maybe defending the gay, deaf son dating a black man would've been deep, profound, and full of sensitivity in 1992, but now it's like whatever. It is beyond corny and forced, it's laughable. I'm so glad Diane Keaton and Craig T. Nelson are so defensive about their boy who had to fight the odds, but they treat poor SJP like garbage for no reason. Makes a lot of sense.This is not a comedy. This is not a charming holiday film. It is an utterly dumb movie. I don't care how the movie resolved itself. Diane Keaton has some disease, but that makes me happy, because her character is a witch and nothing would make me sympathetic towards her character.Also, I read other peoples reviews and I see that the Claire Danes ends up with SJP's boyfriend and SJP ends up with Luke Wilson.

This movie puts you on a roller-coaster ride right from the beginning though and I realized it when I started to cry at how the family was acting towards Meredith pretty early into the movie (I should have brought tissues). One minute I was crying with pity, the next I was laughing hysterically, the next crying again at a touching family moment, and so on. You don't know who to hate in this movie, who to love, or who to pity (with the exception of Luke Wilson, who is very lovable throughout the movie). This movie gets into the complexities of relationships and makes you think about how judging people can be of others without even knowing them, and how people misconstrue things to suit themselves and their views.

Seeing the angry comments from some users here about how PC it was and how it was totally pushing the gay agenda, I of course wanted to see it even more... but all I can say is, if this is the best Hollywood can do to push a liberal agenda, they might as well all join Focus on the Family or something.What a revolting set of people. From my understanding of the movie, most of them hadn't even met the girl, and the daughter who had seemed to dislike her primarily because she had a habit of clearing her throat and was a little uptight. Well, time for a hanging of the girl then. The rest of this ""liberal"" family decide they will hate her before they even give her a chance and they proceed to be vile to her throughout most of the movie. This is never really explained or even justified by the way she behaves - she's perfectly nice with them but they are just vicious back. I've never known a family who prided themselves on being liberal be like that - with someone like her they'd generally be politely patronising or treat her more as a figure of fun then be all-out vicious to her.This was no kooky, liberal family, they were just a bunch of whining, selfish, self-obsessed morons. I didn't care about any of the characters except the girl they were sending up. I found it totally unbelievable that the little ""swapping partners"" story would be done so neatly and be so readily accepted by all. I just didn't care about any of the characters.It had its moments but it doesn't really work as a comedy - not enough laughs, and a lot of the ""humour"" wasn't ""dark"" it was just cruel. and I don't think it really works as a drama because I don't see anything to care about in most of the characters, so it's like it doesn't really matter what happens to them anyway - and as I said before I find the plot thin and incredible.",The Family Stone

Perhaps because of my background as a mental health professional, I found this to be a very confusing and inconsistent attempt to picture what could have been a funny family event. The writers touched so many bases that one wonders if five families could have contained the many quirks, pathologies and eccentricities found in this single unit. My overall impression was of the incredible nastiness this family displayed toward the fiancée of the eldest son, a person no one but the youngest daughter had ever met, but who became the target of hostility, primarily based on the report given by the nasty little sister. The fact that the parents were incapable of maintaining even a modicum of civility or to set the example for the children, speaks to their dysfunction rather than the humor of the situation. Yes, I realize that a terminal illness was also an issue, and yes, Keaton is a fine actress, but her character failed the test of grace--more the writer's fault than Keaton's.I think that what would actually have happened in this situation is that either the eldest son would have upbraided his family for their boorish and cruel behavior, taken his fiancée and left(if he was really committed)telling them they could call him when they grew up; or, the fiancée, seeing that he was not really committed, would have left, herself.

476,kelle-e,great casting,10,27 December 2005,"Diane Keaton and Craig T Nelson are fantastic together. SJP and Rachel McAdams were terrific, as well. Best performance I've ever seen from Luke Wilson.This was a great movie! Very heartwarming to see a family so close and emotional. They held nothing back. They knew each other so well that they new SJP's character was better for one son than the other. Great performances by all.There is so much more to this movie than the ""holiday"" theme. Every story line was classic.I loved it and can't wait to add it to my very small and selective DVD collection.",The Family Stone
477,matthew-pearce,"hits every family cliché in the book... if you only see one movie this Christmas, don't make it this one!",4,27 November 2005,"The story focuses around a close-nit family who all get together for the Christmas day festivities. But the family group are quite exclusive and not any new comer is welcome to join the club.So when much-loved eldest son brings home fiancé to be to get the family approval, the family isn't having her join. The story weaves through all the clichés available such as in-humour that only the close nit group would understand then when the new girl tries to join in, nobody reacts positively to anything she says or does. They play charades, but its all an embarrassing flop.Mostly annoying was the bringing out of prejudices against gay couples as you would think it possibly could. The youngest son is gay and lives with his dashing black boyfriend. Everyone seems to love the two boys together so much so that the mother exclaims at one feast-time: ""I wish all my sons had been gay"". Its a bit stomach turning when Miss Special puts her two-pence worth into the discussion, then other family members turn her comments (abuse) on its head by making the aggressor (Miss Special) feel guilty - and no doubt most of the viewing audience as well.So a modern morality play? Maybe. Possibly one to hire on video / DVD in a years time, but not something I would recommend you rush out to see. For 'Sex-in-the-City' TV fans it is a must because Miss Special is Sarah Jessica Parker - Carrie Bradshaw from the hit show. And through most of the performance Ms Parker does play the old TV show character by saying stupid things, analysing it and then attempting to correct herself.There is a twist in the closing shot, but its so predictable and fore-told that I am not convinced it needed to be played out. Then again, the film does end on a high note so the paying audience who were fed up throughout most of the show go home feeling a little bit happy.",The Family Stone
478,lwenegrat,A Thoroughly Unpleasant Movie,1,28 November 2005,"The Family Stone is one of the most unpleasant movies I have ever seen. All the actors did fine jobs, but the plot was so incredible and frustrating that had I not been sitting in the middle of a crowded theater I would have left mid-way through. The story centers around Christmas at the Stone family home. One of the Stone brothers brings his girlfriend home to spend Christmas and the days preceding it at his parents home, where she will meet his entire family (parents and four siblings) for the first time. They dislike the girlfriend immediately, and the great majority of the movie is spent on the many ways in which the family makes her feel unwelcome and excluded. Even the arrival of the girlfriend's sister, who came to offer her support, does not provide any relief to the girlfriend, as her sister is so unhelpful that it is impossible to believe that they actually grew up together and have affection for one another. The Family Stone is just unfortunate, and does no credit to the talented cast.",The Family Stone

She's like an old, female, past his prime Al Pacino...with drastically less talent. I'm so sick of her ""I'm 60 years old but I'm still sexy""-shtick. Sarah Jessica Parker was OK, Luke Wilson was excellent, Craig T. Nelson and Dermot Mulroney were decent, but they all seemed trapped in this ridiculous plot. Dermot Mulroney's character's been dating SJP's character for God knows how long, and then has a love at first sight thing w/ her sister...OK, say I buy that...and then SJP ends up getting drunk and thinking she banged her soon-to-be fiancée's brother...OK, let's say I buy that too...but the deaf, gay, inter-racial couple? That's where I draw the line.And by the way, didn't they market this stinker as a comedy? I watched it on HBO, and I still want my money back.An absolute train-wreck of a film.

For one, the story is completely far-fetched. I mean a holiday love switch between siblings is truly unrealistic. The previews were misleading. I expected a light-hearted romantic comedy instead I got a movie that made me want to slit my wrist. I felt like I had been to a Jewel concert. Luke Wilson's nonchalant, half-baked character was the only breath of fresh in the entire flick. Although being a fan of Rachel McAdams, I did enjoy her bratty, spiteful sister role.

483,gil-97,Not really a bad romance,6,20 April 2006,"SPOILERS Not actually a bad romance, but follows many mistakes these films have grown up over the years, after Harry and Sally came out. The plot is straightforward. So straightforward, that you can see from the beginning, how it is going to end. From the beginning you see absolutely tolerant family (how more tolerant you could be, if your gay deaf son has a black boyfriend and adopt a black child) that still cannot accept this nervous girl. Hint? Yes. And for God sake, if you ran after someone, catch them BEFORE they get on the bus and ask them to stay, why the hell do they ALWAYS have to get on it, just so the whole bus has to wait, when you change your mind 15 seconds and 100 meters later. And finally, after one brother drops one girl just to fall in love with her sister while she stays with his brother, would that be okay for you? That would be too much even for Beverly Hills or Melrose Place. As I said at the beginning, it is not a complete cr*p. Just do not expect too much. If you like romantic comedies and do not mind mindless clichés - go ahead, but do not say I did not warn you.",The Family Stone

I am not the biggest Sarah Jessica Parker fan, but I love Rachel McAdams, that's the only reason I went to see this movie in the first place. This thing had me laughing my A$$ off and bawling my eyes out all at the same time!!! Although the movie was kinda predictable (I guessed every single twist beforehand), it was definitely worth seeing, and I am honestly considering going back for another dose of it. It gives us a peek at a true family, as imperfect as one can possibly be (not like anyone of us have perfect families anyways), and shows how they make it through the holiday from hell (for more reasons than one) by counting on each other, all the while trying not to kill each other along the way. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone and everyone, whether you're a sap like me, or you just need a good reality check to make you appreciate your own family and the time you have with them.",The Family Stone

The trailers I had seen made it look more like a comedy. I had read on yahoo that is was going to be the next ""family"" Christmas movie. I would not advise anyone under 25 to go see it.

486,ghanagirl,The Family Failure,3,17 December 2005,"If it were ever true that one can't judge a book by its cover, than certainly a movie can't be judged by its star-studded cast. The Family Stone is a movie relying on holiday movie lovers and women needing to see ""Carrie"" on the screen again. Meredith, played by Sarah Jessica Parker goes home with her boyfriend to meet his family for the first time and spend Christmas with them. The family contains a more varied assortment of characters than a box of holiday chocolates. No matter how assorted, you can always count on the turtle, the mint, and the orange filling that no one ever wants. In Family Stone, you can count on the carefree and annoying youngest daughter, the bonehead but cute middle son, the gay and deaf--yes GAY and DEAF-- son who has the black--yes black--partner the pregnant oldest daughter who takes after mom, and the reliable professor dad. Then there's mom who is the ribbon that holds this box of chocolates together, and last and definitely least underdeveloped ""Everett"", Sarah Jessica's love interest. In a series of events that span the three or so days before Christmas we see how ""tight"" the family is and how much they despise outsiders (no matter their son being gay, deaf, and married to a black man) we learn of a predictable ailment plaguing the glue the holds the family somewhat in place and the baby the gay-interracial-handicapped couple is trying to adopt. To help her get survive Christmas with the Stones, Meredith calls her tree-hugging Peace Corp sister Julie who obviously has no life of her own, because she comes to spend Christmas with them also. Needless to say Everett falls for someone besides Meredith, Meredith finds happiness underneath another ""stone"" and a Christmas miracle is born. Fast-forward to a year later, the gay/deaf son has his child, Meredith and Julie have married into the family, and the ribbon that held the package together has been permanently untied. At the risk of sounding sexist, a female writer/director of a chick flick would know that in no realm is it acceptable for a sister to hook-up an ex-boyfriend, especially before he's become an ex, and especially during the same week he's planning to propose. The plot is unclear, and the tangible parts are predictable. The happy ending made me sick to my stomach. For holiday movies stick to Love Actually. For chick flicks try Something's Gotta Give, also starring Diane Keaton. For Sarah Jessica Parker, put your movie ticket money towards the three hundred dollar complete series of Sex and the City.Monica Burns",The Family Stone

Dialogue was believable, colors were vivid, especially the wintry New England landscapes, and the acting convincing. The big issue, however, is that the film was trite; the same stuff has already been done better in Moonstruck and various other pictures. The coincidences were awkward. Don't love Sally? That's all right. You can always love Alice or maybe even George! Seldom has so much talent been put to such meaningless and banal use.

Even the plot twists are fully predictable. Generally flat acting with some strength from Diane Keeton. The photography shifts through the show are annoying; characters are initially filmed unflatteringly, then slowly gain makeup and new hair arrangements to make them more lovable. Come on.

I also found that the film confirmed some of my romantic notions, for example, we are attracted to those who see a the most hidden parts of us; the parts we keep hidden our to fear. If you have a large family you will also find plenty to relate to. The actors are well cast. I enjoyed Craig T. Nelson in this role. Sarah Jessica Parker is far from Carrie Bradshaw in this movie.

I felt really bad for the character. The funny parts were drowned out by the sad and mean behaviors of other characters.There were just too many issues in this movie to make it entertaining.While I disliked the plot line I thought the acting in this movie was good.If you are determined to see a Christmas movie, go rent The Grinch!

So we went. First of all, the commercials on TV give the idea that this is going to be some comedy about a girlfriend coming home to meet the boyfriends family. I would have enjoyed the movie if they had gone that route. Instead, they tried for a drama/comedy mix that they came up way short in accomplishing. Without revealing anything important, I will say that the show tried to cover every situation a family could ever come in contact with. In fact, I think they tried to hard to get it all in. So much so that, they only gave pieces of information that we needed to make the movie coherent. Certain situations seemed to come from no where and the scenes themselves jumped around so much that we could not help but laugh. Take my review for what it is.

I loved the way the gay/bi-racial relationship was not exploited in the promos for the movie. Even during the movie it was treated with the same acceptance as the heterosexual couples-with, of course, the exception of the tirade at the dinner table....and that was crucial to the character...I also was unprepared for the drama part of the movie-the crisis involving the illness.

493,jbyrne4792,Simply a Beautiful Film,10,21 December 2005,"Finally, I went to the movies and I FELT something!!!! I am a 23 year old male from the New England area, I now live in Los Angeles. I see many films and I was so thankful and refreshed to finally go into a theater and be TAKEN somewhere emotionally and come out of the theater a changed person.This film was so much more than I anticipated, I related to every single character and I was so pleased at how realistically and fairly the directors portrayed every walk of life. There were moments in the film where the characters would say something that felt so real and then there were little subtleties for instance (the symbolism of the ring) that made the story fill my heart with so much love for the characters. I wanted to comfort them all, it was like in the two hours I was in that dark room, they were MY family.Miss Keaton is so at comfort and honest as the Mother as she is unapologetic. At moments her character is so frustratingly judgemental that I wanted to dislike her, but at the end we find out her predictions and senses are so wise and loving.Miss Parker is on pointe and systematically perfect and different in her role, she is incredible entertaining. Her transformation is one of the best parts of the film and she makes an unintentional decision that actually made me begin to cry my heart out.There are many moment and relationships that unfold in this believable yet slightly fantasy world. The only disappointing thing about this film are the negative reviews I have been reading.I think Hollywood and Journalists want so badly to hate a movie that has any humanity in it mixed with physical comedy and richly dramatic characters. They want a successful TV star (Parker) to fail for some reason because she is the lead in a holiday romantic drama. I felt the opposite and I wanted to like this film and I did! In this era filled with over-the-top CGI super hero movies and played out Midevil battle films mutated from classic children's tales and no brainer dumbed down B movies, I was so relieved to see someone take a simple subject- a family- and teach such valuable lessons. There was one scene that touched on the subject of injustice for gay people. The mother takes a turn to defend her son and says something so remarkable and so funny and it is done in such an organic way, an argument at the dinner table. It creates a conflict between the whole family and in the end no one was wrong - there was just ignorance and everyone learned from it.There is also one character who is pregnant. She does not say much at all and her part is not that elaborate but in fact, she is one of the most important role as so much is said through her eyes and through the photography of her.The vignettes of the characters were done with the depth of those in Woody Allen's Interiors, from the Photography to the art direction to every detail of hair and make up, wardrobe and art direction. This is something that I want to see in a film.Pictures that have really gotten my soul this year were Memoirs of a Geisha, Walk the Line, Rize and this film. I like a diverse type of films and I believe this one stands up to all of those I mention.The one reason that I believe makes this film so meaningful, is what happens at the end of the movie. There is a very tragic thru-line that becomes so beautiful and inspiring at the end. I will not give it away but I will say that it has made me look at life differently tonight and I HOPE it makes me change the way I treat people! Four Stars from me! I apologize I am a poor writer but I wanted to give this film absolute praise from the heart of someone who needed this story told.",The Family Stone

This was a very disappointing experience that left me and the family feeling cheated of out of our money, our time and our holiday spirit. I would not recommend this movie to anyone unless you are in the mood to be assaulted by an anti-women, anti-family and anti-Christmas political essay. At one point my spouse and I discussed leaving the theater early but decided to stay because 'it had to get better'. It didn't get better. Had we left we would only have missed more people groups being offended. At one point when the scene faded to black (apparently to give the audience time to reflect on the latest political statement) I heard a nearby young adult viewer comment ""so is it over?""

When commercial movies have real heart, you experience something that is pleasant on two levels, first the enjoyment of a solid script and great performances; Paul Schneider's character Brad is just a small gem of perfection, the awkwardness, the desire, the fundamental decency.

The movie takes literally an hour before the plot takes any kind of turning point, and is just very awkward that whole time. I thought it would be worth it eventually... Well eventually it got even worse when every character reacts in a way that no real human ever would. I swear this was written by an AI.",The Family Stone
509,pmcchesney,two concerns,10,5 January 2006,"I saw this movie today and loved it but have a comment and a question for the above reviewer. I didn't understand why Amy was so violent in her dislike of Meredith. I saw that Meredith's personality was very off-putting but was puzzled about why Amy in particular reacted to her so strongly. My comment is that I saw Diane Keaton, whom I've always admired, in a TV movie last week, the name of which I can't now recall, portraying a mother whose adult daughter had recently been killed in a car accident. The mother decided to visit her daughter's friends in their summer rental, where the daughter was staying when she died, in order to learn about her daughter's relationships. That mother's personality, although more obnoxious than Sybil Stone's, was very similar and Keaton displayed similar mannerisms, dress and both facial and vocal tonalities. A recent article in the NY Times Sunday magazine covered an interview with Keaton in which she appeared much the same as these two film characters. When such homogeneity of character seems clear, I have to question the skill of the actor who doesn't venture out of the comfort zone of her basic personality, which makes me wonder if the character of the actor is so compelling that we want to watch regardless, or if we as a culture are so bland that we expect nothing more. Guess I have another comment: I thought Sybil's telling Everett that she was dying just after denying him the ring was a cheap shop at sympathy. Even if he didn't get it, we did.",The Family Stone
510,Dom-inate,One of the worst films I have EVER EVER seen!!!!!!!!!!,1,8 January 2006,"Look I have a pretty high tolerance for bad movies - for goodness sake I even watch the Hallmark channel from time to time.However, this has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen there is absolutely nothing to recommend it. It is neither funny nor poignant. It is trying to be too many things and doing none of them well.I finished watching the movie with a sense that if I knew anyone remotely like these people I would have a great deal of difficulty getting up and facing the day tomorrow and I didn't remotely care what happened to any of them.Please take my warning and give this movie the widest possible berth - you won't regret it!",The Family Stone
511,it_is_me_hind,The Mean Stone!,5,29 August 2006,"Before I watched the movie, I thought I'd see a similar movie to Meet The Parents, considering both movies are talking about meeting boy/girlfriend's family for the first time. But in this movie, almost everything was unrealistic. All the family members hated Meredith before even meeting her. They all prejudged her, and when they met her they didn't try to like her and all they were doing is convincing Everett not to marry her. The family members were either negative, like the daughter Susannah, or mean to her, mostly Amy, except for their son, Ben. And then there was a sudden unexplainable shift in their emotions, they all liked her and welcomed her in their family and became the nicest people! Nice movie.. but not really good.",The Family Stone
512,muttenz23,Worst movie since Michael,1,11 January 2006,"The scale from 1 - 10 does not let me judge this movie accurately (since there are no minus numbers). I was the worst movie I saw since 'Michael' with John Travolta as an angel. By the end of the movie the entire theater was just laughing at the script, it was simply painful to watch.It's a shame, since the actors are actually quite good, but the script was awful and seemed written by a 10 year old. It was a great relief when it was finally over, especially as the end was dragged out for another 10 minutes as well.Save your money and save your time. This movie is unfortunately not worth it. If you want to see a dysfunctional family, watch 'Arrested Development', the best written show since Seinfeld.",The Family Stone
513,indianayr,technical goofs ruined the movie,3,11 January 2006,"The technical goofs of the microphone dropping into frame 5 times REALLY irritated me!!Didn't anyone at the studio watch this film before it was released? The worst one during the emotional climax of the movie w/ everyone gathering around the X-mas tree after the mothers death-WITH THE ENTIRE BOOM ARM & MICRIPHONE WAVING AROUND AT THE TOP! (making the audience laugh at how lame it was) Every time it happened it reminded EVERYONE- ""Oh yeah, its just a movie!"" Sophmorish editing! I want my $17.50 back!! Had the quality of a home movie. What was Michael Landon thinking other than making a quick buck? Didn't Sara Jessica Parker care that her 1st effort after Sex & the City would be this sad? If they would have paid a little more attention to detail this would have been a passable chick flick even with the lame character development.",The Family Stone
514,gkay71,Great fun film,7,11 January 2006,"I loved this film! Sarah Jessica Parker usually turns me cold and I nearly didn't see it because she was in it, but I was pleasantly surprised! It had me bursting my sides in one second then the tears welled in my eyes the next. Dianne Keaton was probably the only downfall to the movie, she often seems to play the same kind of role. Luke Wilson was brilliant and Clare Danes is no longer Juliet! I wanted to slap Rachel McAdams, she played her role so convincingly, she was awful!The similarity between my ""family stone"" and the one depicted was scary!! I am sure that most people, who have started a new relationship will be able to relate to the story. Go and see it, you won't be disappointed.",The Family Stone
515,lazysusan,Insipid Garbage,3,12 January 2006,"This movie was another stereotypical Hollywood shocker with totally predictable plot. I cringed so many times in this movie and felt the entire movie was a disappointment. I especially disliked the way the movie moved between being a serious family tale and a substandard comedy. What does it want to be? Perhaps it's ""Meet the Parents"" with a splash of ""Smith Family Robinson"". Whatever the case, the comedy was abysmal and the serious parts totally out of context.And please, no more tripping gags. It isn't funny when someone trips over. It's irrelevant.Worst movie in a while for me. Not recommended.",The Family Stone
516,jessrigas,Excellent!,10,12 January 2006,"I saw this movie in January, I have 2 babies so I don't get out much. I went to a 9:40 show by my self on a Thursday night I was the only one in the whole theater. That was nice. I was not even half way through the movie when I had to use the washroom, but I didn't want to miss anything because it was so good. So I held it,and held it, and held it. Eventually I had to stand up and walk. I stood by the doors and watched while doing the pee pee dance. I'm so glad no one else was there to witness me in agony. If you like very funny family movies you have to see this one. I laughed, I cried, it was a great movie!I rate it as a must see!",The Family Stone
517,mlmpn_917,.,8,13 January 2006,"This movie is great. It has almost everything a movie needs to entertain you. I laughed my ass off. The actors were great. I really enjoyed it. I loved the part in which Amy (Rachel McAdams) says : ""I'm the worst?!"" and she slips with that thing Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker) had prepared . That was so funny. I just love how Rachel McAdams acts. She's great. It's funny, I was born on the same day she was but some years later of course. So for the ones who haven't seen this movie, I really think you should go. You won't regret it. I have to write ten lines to be able to submit this comment so I'm just writing................ Well that's about ten lines right? So I'm leaving . WATCH THIS MOVIE IF YOU HAVEN'T.",The Family Stone
518,srasb1129,Trailer Gives the Wrong Impression,9,29 July 2006,"The movie trailer hyped Sarah Jessica Parker's presence in the movie, and gives a false sense that she is playing her cute adorable self. When in fact she is playing a role of a different color. Her character is victim to a cultural climate of conservative vs. liberal. She being viewed as conservative and the family viewed as liberal. So obviously the two do not mix, or so our current political climate leads us to believe.I believe the film makers were going for casting her as someone the family views as not right for their perfect elder son. They seem to believe he doesn't get what love is about, that he is marrying her because she looks like the right kind of wife that someone with a ""suit and tie"" job would marry. There is a deeper story line that we as viewers don't get. Such as the relationship between Evert, the elder son, and Meredith, Sarah Jessica Parker's character, before the Christmas holiday.The trailer would have you believe that Sarah's character is the main focus when in fact she is but a catalyst for the elder son figuring out what kind of life he wants.Once you get past Sarah's change in character you get a film that is enjoyable and heart warming. For the nay sayers it may be that they wanted a more pronounced redemption of Sarah's character, Meredith. What you get is a movie that shows us a family in all its complexity. Parents who want the best for their children, but won't let them figure that out for themselves. Siblings who fight, compete, torment, tease, and most of all love each other. They are people who live by ideals, but fall short of those ideals. They are wonderfully flawed human beings.I liked the movie because it made me laugh and it made me cry. It presented a love that we all should be blessed to experience, and the film makers did a wonderful job conveying that love on the screen.",The Family Stone
519,zita_inzaghi,disappointment in every sector,1,27 June 2006,"If anybody sees the trailer of this film,he will think it as a funny romantic comedy.But surprise!it's not.Neither it's a romantic drama or a serious drama.It can best be described as a confusing director with a good cast and a greasy(of course not the travolta's one) plot.The whole film full of the confusing activities and dull moments.Sarah Jessica Parker can be seen trying to make influence on his boyfriend's family,but guess what she lands with his brother at last.The dying mother(Diane Keaton)supports her younger son(cannot hear)who is a gay(of course with a black partner),the harsh sister(Rachel madams)always raises her voice against parker,Luke Wilson having crush on his elder brother love at the first sight and the elder brother going for the sister of his girlfriend.What to expect from this film?answer is 1 and half of good sleep.Am I a little too bit harsh?.....if u want u can see.But don't say that i didn't tell u before.",The Family Stone
520,sally6797,One of the best movies I've seen!,10,20 January 2006,"The Family Stone was awesome! Actually, I don't go to the movie theater often so most of the time I wait for movies to come out on DVD. However, I was compelled to see this movie...the cast was reason enough-Diane Keaton, Dermont Mulroney, Luke Wilson, Rachel McAdams, Sarah Jessica Parker, Claire Danes, Craig Nelson...COME ON! HOW COULD I NOT?! This is a movie you don't want to wait for on DVD! It's a great plot and the execution of it was effortless. It had a fresh sense of humor and it didn't drown you in one emotion. And, again, you could not ask for a better cast...Diane Keaton is a natural! Dermont Mulroney, one of my favorite actors, is an incredible actor and shines throughout the entire movie. Luke Wilson is simply hilarious - he brought a smile to my face every time he appeared in the movie. Rachel McAdams demonstrates why she's one of the leading actresses in the industry. Her range in acting is impressive. I was so relieved and impressed to watch Sarah Jessica Parker step out of her ""Carrie Bradshaw"" character, which I loved! Definitely watch this movie!!!",The Family Stone
521,KekeVV,Um...,1,25 January 2006,"I was not expecting a predictable romantic comedy. Nor was I expecting SJP to be ANYTHING like Carrie Bradshaw. Who cares about any of that - the movie was AWFUL! It moved with the speed of real life. WHICH IS NOT A GOOD THING!!!! I could not believe how irritating it was that everyone kept mentioning that something was going on and no one would talk about it...a lot like families...but COME ON....I couldn't take another second of it - I wanted to walk out, but I kept hoping it would come together. It never did. So slow, so boring, so awful. There is a difference between funny awkward and reality awkward and just HORRIBLE awkward - this movie was the latter. I don't know what else to say except it was the WORST movie I have EVER seen. Worse than Must Love Dogs, worse than Carousel. Two thumbs down, SO MAD that I spent $9.25.",The Family Stone
522,jasjfarrell,very disappointing,4,2 January 2007,The movie seems to set up Sarah Jessica's character as the most bigoted and ignorant person there is. She is staying with her fiancé's family who just happens to have every type of minority represented among it. This is so stupid since Dermott Mulrooney's character is the fiancé and I can not figure what he would be doing with someone like that. But of course Clair Danes steps onto the scene as Sarah Jessica's sister and everyone loves her. How predictable. Hopefully this move lost a lot of money at the box office so another like it won't be made. I almost forgot....the mother has terminal cancer. The people in this story belong in the cold weather they deserve.,The Family Stone
523,Barbie22,not well,3,30 January 2006,"Even though the movie had a lot of very good actors, it felt empty, it was almost always performed in the same place and the end was awful, i didn't like it at all , the way the brothers switch couples was terrible and you never even saw them in love, you never felt that passion. Why in the world you would do that? are we accepting these kind of behavior? i was speechless at the end of the movie i know its probably normal to do it in one case if they fall in love extremely deeply...but the two of them thats way too much. But have to mention that sometimes was little funny , and the acting was OK, Diane Keaton she is amazing , who can criticize her... Nobody",The Family Stone
524,desertmoon1,Bravo!,5,6 May 2006,"Well... I must admit I initially went to see this movie for the actors involved in it. Like... Sarah Jessica, Rachel McAdams and Diane Keaton. But I never expected it to be really, really good. Sarah Jessica was perfection - the epitome of an uptight conservative - but was simultaneously likable. At least to me. Rachel McAdams as Amy... LOL. What a mean girl. But laughably so. And Diane Keaton, she was an amazing mom, and not a weak link in the least. I'd say the only weak link was Claire Danes maybe. Don't like her... OK. And also, the ""Joey"" type brother who slept with SJ at the end. If he had tormented her for so long, what would suddenly make him want to make her drunk (or at least tipsy) and then sleep with her??? Buttt... still an amazing movie. I'll see this one again!",The Family Stone

527,neurtic,For Samwise06,7,25 September 2006,"I wish to comment on the comment by Samwise06. Why don't YOU learn about grammar! Or do they not capitalize the first letter of the first word of a sentence and the pronoun ""I"" on that rock called Australia?As for the film? I thought it was quite enjoyable, though very clichéd. The fish out of water in the form of ""uptight person meets wild and unconventional family over the holidays"" has been done to death. I agree that there was too much going on for one flick, but it was still entertaining. I normally hate romantic comedies, which I guess is why I kinda liked this one. Not much romance or comedy to speak of.I must say that Claire Danes is getting better looking by the picture. She looked like such a goofy looking girl in Romeo + Juliet, but now I gotta rank her near the top of the hotness meter.",The Family Stone
528,chattycat-50220,Terrible movie and terrible acting....,1,14 January 2019,"This was the stupidest wanna be holiday movie. I thought for sure it would be good, but I guess I should have watched the trailer. But from what I hear, the trailer lied. Stupid movie about a stupid family. Terrible mean matriarch and no one willing to stand up to her. No wonder she is dying. Also in what family does two sister end up marrying to the brothers (spoiler alert) even though one of the sister was already seeing the brother. Then they do a wonderful job of trying to portray everyone's relationship as dysfunctional except the homosexual relationship. For whatever reason it, it without problems. A whole waste of 90 minutes I will never get back. Skip the movie. Negative stars.",The Family Stone
529,brooke-edmunds,Better than I thought it would be,8,7 January 2007,"What I had previously thought was going to be this lighthearted boy bringing girl home to family to get family engagement ring for girl ended up being a lot more like ""Home for the Holidays"". Sure, there are some funny parts, but it tends to echo more of how real families are: quirky, snarky, sometimes plain old mean, echos of hurts past that flare up, etc. Sure, some of it was a bit over the top, but it is a movie. I am firmly convinced that for playing a the complex female lead/head of family, Diane Keaton holds the patent (rightfully so). And in all the years of watching ""Coach"", I am am still surprised at Craig T. Nelson's depth.The scene that sealed the movie for me (and no, it's not a spoiler) was during gift opening, when Diane Keaton is looking at Rachel McAdams (playing her daughter) and the communication to me was so honest - I've had moments like that with my mother. So yes, definite chick flick, but still enjoyable enough that my husband saw bits of pieces and enjoyed it too.",The Family Stone
