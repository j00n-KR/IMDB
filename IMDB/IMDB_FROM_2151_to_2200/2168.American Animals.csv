0,SnoopyStyle,true crime idiots,8,24 August 2018,"It's 2013. Spencer Reinhard (Barry Keoghan) is an aspiring artist from Lexington, Kentucky. His friend Warren Lipka (Evan Peters) is an uninspired athletic scholarship student. Spencer goes on a tour of the library at Transylvania University where he sees a valuable Audubon book. He tells Warren about the book who starts pushing to steal the relatively unguarded treasure. Warren becomes unstoppable in pushing the group to pull off the scheme inspired by various movies.This true crime drama is enticing not for any belief that the co-conspirators would ever get away with the crime. There is a possibility that one of more of them would abandon the plans but these American idiots' faulty fates are never in doubt. The structure of using the 'real' people in this true crime drama is quite effective. It's so effective that I wouldn't mind it doing a Fargo. I really like the chemistry with the two leads. It's solid acting from these actors.",American Animals
1,nogodnomasters,Kentucky Four,4,23 September 2018,"This is a true story which is re-enacted by actors but told documentary style by the real characters involved. Four college kids plan a robbery of rare books from Transylvania University in Lexington...and not too well. The characters were on the boring side. Dialogue likewise but you to sleep. And robberies that don't go that well, don't make great cinema. Rather than try to make this realistic, they should have added some Hollywood action/drama and maybe make one of the characters a girl...like a fitness instructor and race car driver. Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",American Animals
2,kosmasp,Unlucky or just un-smart?,9,25 February 2019,"Let's get one thing clear: The main characters seem to be anything but smart or clever for that matter. Having written that, there surely are people with less intelligence out there. And the fact they are not acting in a way one would feel is good, only heightens the experience the movie gives us. And it is an experience that breaks the fourth wall. Because while it acts like a documentary and the actors talk directly to the viewer, it is not.So the structure of the movie is quite clever contrary to the main characters here. This more than just funny, it is hillarious. It is also a movie that will not have a broad audience, just because of the way it was made and because it is ""special"" (interest). So if that sounds like something that is interesting to you, take a chance and give it a go",American Animals
3,classicsoncall,"""This is your red pill or blue pill moment, my friend.""",7,4 November 2018,"When all was said and done, I couldn't believe that these four otherwise intelligent characters couldn't figure out that they were in way over their heads when it came to the actual heist. They thought they had adequately compensated for contingencies, but when Spencer and Warren showed up with aliases at the museum in New York, they should have realized right then and there how dumb they looked. And giving a personal cell phone number to the woman at the museum? It doesn't take a Mensa candidate to realize how stupid a move that was. The one thing that really struck home with me was near the finale when the real Warren Lipka stated on camera how the four of them 'weren't special', an acknowledgment that everything they'd been told growing up was only to make them feel good about themselves instead of opening their eyes to the reality of how life works. Not that that will register with a lot of viewers. The most ironic outcome of the story - Spencer Reinhard now paints birds for a living! Audobon would be proud.",American Animals
4,jboothmillard,American Animals,7,26 July 2021,"I remember seeing the poster for this film somewhere, it was highly rated by critics, and when I read more about it and its cast, it definitely appealed to me, directed by Bart Layton (The Imposter). It is a dramatized version of the true story of a robbery, as told by the culprits themselves. Basically, in 2003 in Lexington, Kentucky, college art student Spencer Reinhard (Dunkirk's Barry Keoghan) is looking for inspiration. He is given a tour of Transylvania University library's rare-book collection. Highly valuable books in the library's collection include a rare first edition of Birds of America of John James Audubon and Charles Darwin's scientific theory, On the Origin of Species. He and his friend, rebellious student Warren Lipka (X-Men: Days of Future Past's Evan Peters), who is on an athletic scholarship, discuss the possibility of stealing these rare books. All the pair know about heists is what they have seen in movies, including The Thomas Crown Affair, The Italian Job, Reservoir Dogs, and Point Break. The collection is guarded by only one librarian, Betty Jean ""BJ"" Gooch (The Handmaid's Tale's Ann Dowd), who they believe they could easily overpower before stealing the books and escaping via the staff elevator. Warren travels to Amsterdam to meet black-market buyers who express interest in the books, informing Spencer they could make millions. They later enlist the help of two friends: Eric Borsuk (Jared Abrahamson) to provide logistics and Chas Allen III (Blake Jenner) as the getaway driver. They make an appointment for a private viewing of the collection to gain access to the room and disguise themselves as elderly businessmen. But the heist is aborted when Warren sees multiple librarians meeting in the room. Spencer wants to abandon the plan, but Warren persuades him and the others to try again. The next day, with confirmation that no other appointments are happening, Warren and Eric enter the library, this time without disguises, with Spencer acting as lookout. Warren clumsily tasers the librarian, making Eric help restrain her. They blunder exiting the building, dropping The Birds of America, but escape with two books, including the Darwin. The group travels to Christie's auction house in New York to value the books. Spencer is told he must return the next day and leaves his cell phone number with an assistant. Chas berates Spencer for using his own phone number that can be identified, and they return to Lexington with the books. Shortly after, Spencer realises the police will also be able to trace the email address they used to make the appointments with Christie's and the library. Eventually the FBI do identify the four young men, and they are arrested. In documentary interviews with the real-life thieves filmed years after they are released from prison, they express regret. Their interviews are interwoven with the recreated scenes. The epilogue says that Eric is a writer and Chas is a fitness coach both living in California; Warren lives in Philadelphia and is studying filmmaking; and Spencer lives in Lexington as an artist. Also starring Udo Kier as Mr. Van Der Hoek, with the real Betty Jean Gooch. The young male leads all play their parts perfectly, with a witty script and some amusing moments, the leadup to the heist and the job itself are engaging, and the story mixed with the real people talking hindsight is interesting, a worthwhile crime docudrama. Very good!",American Animals
5,christopher-underwood,Very rare and illuminating experience,8,19 February 2020,"Such a good film. I felt shattered at the end, as if I had been through some terrible trauma, but exciting all the same, of course. First big surprise here is that this largely American film is directed by an English documentary filmmaker. Second is that the poster and title are just a wee bit misleading. Depicting a real incident in Kentucky we accompany four students on a mission to steal some rare books. Involving an excellent Evan Peters as leader of the group and also featuring the actual four from the original incident freshly released from jail. I have never seen anything like this as we slip from acted to real and back mixing and matching dialogue with the one character talking to himself at one point. Very involving throughout and very imaginatively shot, this leads to the most incredible heist. I'm not sure my heart has ever beat as fast and the mixture of fear, excitement, relief and horror was quite incredible. Most of this is down to the fact that the filmmaking technique used tends to draw you in personally and breaks down the so called fourth wall and as in a dream (or nightmare!) a large part of you is actually mentally engaged in the action. Inside as opposed to outside. Very rare and illuminating experience when the urge of four kids to do something different and make something of themselves tips over into something unstoppable.",American Animals
6,Hellmant,MoviePass Venture's first win!,9,29 June 2018,"'AMERICAN ANIMALS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A new crime drama released by MoviePass (the new Netflix of the theaters)! The film tells the true story of a library heist at Transylvania University (in 2004 Lexington, Kentucky). The actual people involved in the crimes narrate the film; while actors Evan Peters, Barry Keoghan, Blake Jenner and Jared Abrahamson play them in flashbacks. The movie was written and directed by Bart Layton, and it's gotten mostly positive reviews from critics. I found it to be really involving and intense, it's definitely an impressive debut from MoviePass Ventures!Warren Lipka and Spencer Reinhard tell their true story (in modern day), about how they conspired to steal expensive Audubon prints, and rare books, from a special collections library at Transylvania University (in Lexington, Kentucky), in 2004. Evan Peters and Barry Keoghan play the pair when they were younger, as the actual criminals narrate the story. They had help (in the heist) form Chas Allen and Eric Borsuk (played by Blake Jenner and Jared Abrahamson, during the narrated scenes). The criminals' family and friends also take part in film interviews, throughout the movie. The film is funny and seemingly light-hearted at times, and at other times it's really intense and shocking. The climax and ending are pure crime drama cinema at it's best. Keoghan and Peters are both good in the leads, and the actual criminals have strong screen presence as well (especially Reinhard). It's a near masterpiece that's definitely worth seeing I'd say. MoviePass Venture's first win!",American Animals
7,FeastMode,my notes,1,26 July 2019,"I wanted to cry from how pointless this movie is. entirely boring and completely useless. not only is it another movie based on a lame true story, but i am completely baffled that anyone would have chosen this story to make a movie out of. this is the most bland and ordinary true story i've ever heard. i can summarize the 2 hours that makes up this movie in 2 words (1 viewing)

8,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Thoroughly exciting, bracingly original and surprisingly powerful; truly invigorating filmmaking.",8,10 September 2018,"It's not often that a film makes you sit up in your seat and take notice, yet that's exactly what this heist picture does simply by being so brilliantly and bracingly original essentially for its entire duration. 'American Animals (2018)' intertwines real-life interview footage with its more traditional, though still refreshingly unique (especially in their fantastic editing), dramatisations to create an effortlessly cohesive and compelling narrative in which the documentary is inseparable from the cinematic. This culminates in a gripping, moving and viscerally vibrant account of a 'true story' that not only feels as close to being so as humanly possible but also like something that actually hasn't quite been done before. That's thoroughly exciting. The same can be said for the rest of feature, too, as it's a truly invigorating piece of filmmaking. It shines just as brightly from a narrative point of view as a technical one. There's an emotionally impactful cautionary tale steeped in regret running at the heart of the flick, with a wonderful and almost intangible tension constantly pulling between the interviewed men and their young recreations; the latter justify their actions out of a fear they'll regret not doing them and the former seem to regret having done so. This runs counter to the point you might expect it to make - inadvertently or otherwise, which is also the point most movies in its genre tend to lean towards. Some critics have mistaken it for falling into the trap of 'glamorisation', but I don't think this could be further from the truth as there's often a sense of foreboding, ominous suspense and even real horror which makes for a much more 'realistic' and impactful experience that focuses on the pain of actions that are often brushed aside and could therefore be mistaken as 'not that bad'. At times, it can be kind of harrowing and there's certainly a tinge of sadness to the whole affair. The regret is plain as day. In general, it's powerful stuff. I have a feeling that this movie has just changed its genre for the better. How many times do you get to say that and mean it? 8/10",American Animals
9,ThomasDrufke,Downright Strange,7,13 January 2019,"Now here is one of the most unique films of 2018, both in the story itself and the way Bart Layton tells said story. The fact that they used the real life people for each of the four main characters to help propel the story forward in a documentary-style fashion is absolutely brilliant, and even hilarious at times. Unlike their real-life counterparts, these four actors seem to have a really great future, each having their own share of scenes to steal. Unsurprisingly, Barry Keoghan was the clear standpoint, constantly bordering the line of unsettlingly charismatic and offputting. Which, for a movie like this, is basically perfect. A certain part of me watching this kept going, are these kids complete idiots? Some of the things they decide to do and how they go about doing them are just mind-bendingly stupid, but the way these characters act create a definite believability in some regard. But undoubtedly, American Animals is one of the strangest and most interesting films of 2018.7.6/10",American Animals
10,cricketbat,This documentary/dramatization needs to be seen to be believed,8,26 May 2020,"American Animals offers a unique experience in storytelling. This film blends documentary-style interviews with a dramatized version of the actual events in a way I've never seen before, highlighting the unreliable nature of our memories. Plus, the story is one you need to see to believe, as this insane heist was carried out by college-aged amateurs. I'll be thinking about this film for a while.",American Animals
11,westsideschl,"Well Thought Out, But For ...",6,12 September 2018,"Well, it wasn't a thrilling, edge of your seat event & production, just mostly showing the mundane personalities of four athletic & intelligent college age males who think it might be fun and profitable to steal a few books from a library in 2004. They did think through many potential problems, and from the library's setup it should have been a cake walk. They even, supposedly, acquired some ideas from ""Ocean's 11"". Even though slightly experienced thieves from past capers they had the customary dumb, forgot-to-think-of-this, trip ups. A good read on this caper is in Vanity Fair magazine. I wonder if they get money for the movie rights & interviews (basically being paid/rewarded afterwards for stealing). Transylvania University is real (bad luck to be name associated w/pop fiction), and is an elderly southeast religious institution (of course), affiliated w/the ""Christian Church (Disciples of Christ).

14,tomgillespie2002,Astonishing heist film that breathes new life into a well-worn genre,8,16 September 2018,"For decades the movies have taught us how the perfect heist goes down. You need a group of big personalities - all experts in a required field - an intricate plan, blueprints to map out the target, and the best gadgets a cheeky crook can buy. And of course, you need a handsome, charismatic leader, usually in the form of a Frank Sinatra, George Clooney or Sandra Bullock. Yes, a director such as Steven Soderbergh knows how to deliver a robbery with style, panache and a sense of fun, but the real world operates a little differently. American Animals, based on the theft of some rare and valuable books from the Transylvania University library by four kids who seemingly had no reason to dare such a feat, has great fun combining these two worlds. Director Bart Layton, who warmed up with 2012's true crime documentary The Imposter, relays this tale as both documentary and dramatic reconstruction, like Touching the Void but with more interaction between the actors and real-life subjects.It sounds like ""look at me"" film-making, and it arguably is, but the film is stitched together so wonderfully that you can only sit back and admire the swagger of it all. The world Layton captures is incredibly dark indeed, one of degrading fraternity initiation ceremonies and endless supermarkets isles lined with colourful food packaging designed to create the illusion of choice. At least, that's how our two protagonists - anti-heroes may be the more suitable term - see it. Spencer Reinhard (Barry Keoghan) is a talented art student who feels like there must be more to life than this. His best friend Warren Lipka (Evan Peters), the joint-smoking loudmouth who is up for anything, feels very much the same, only he's way more angry about it. During a routine tour of the University library, Spencer learns that the lightly-guarded building houses the valuable The Birds of America by John James Aubudon, and only a nice old lady is there to watch over it. Stealing it should be easy, so Spencer confides in Warren, who quickly takes the lead in planning and executing the audacious heist.There's a wonderful moment during American Animals where the foursome (Jared Abrahamson's Eric Borsuk and Blake Jenner's Chas Allen are also drafted later on) imagine their plan playing out. It's like ballet, with every cabinet opening with ease and every book gathered up falling gently into their bags. And of course, they're all wearing tuxedos. Earlier on we see Spencer and Warren doing research, only people don't write books about the perfect robberies they've carried out, so they're left with movies. The likes of Rififii, The Killing and Reservoir Dogs are their textbooks, so it's no surprise when they're caught off-guard when the reality of the situation smacks them in the face. The biggest obstacle is the nice old lady, Betty Jean Gooch (the always-great Ann Dowd), who they imagine will fall gracefully into an unconscious state after a zap from a taser. In reality, she kicked, screamed and wet herself, but the boys carried on with their plan anyway. With the real Spencer, Warren, Eric and Chas telling their own stories to camera, American Animals could have run the risk of softening or even glamorising this story, but Layton is careful to point out the consequences, and the rippling effect it had on everybody caught up in it. It's an astonishing piece of work that ramps up the tension to unbearable levels, crafted by a film-maker keen to breathe new life into a well-worn genre.",American Animals
15,eddie_baggins,A heist film with a difference,8,28 January 2019,"Filmmaker Bart Layton's first feature film since the success of his mind-bending documentary The Imposter in 2012, American Animal's see's the talented director return to an experience similar to his breakout hit by delivering a narrative that blurs the line between fact and fiction, whilst allowing the real life protagonists at the heart of the story time in the spotlight.More ambitious in scope than The Imposter in a theatrical sense, Animal's allows Layton to showcase his growing skills behind the camera and lead a talented young cast of performers to tell the bizarre yet true story of a group of college students planning and enacting upon a heist that they see as their opportunity to ""do something"" with their lives , despite never before committing any grand criminal acts or without ever giving off the impression they were young men about to commit a dangerous and high profile act criminal act.Targeting a range of rare books that were a part of the Special Collections section of the Kentucky University, art student Spencer Reinhard (Keoghan), uninterested sporting student and carefree Warren (Peters), wannabe FBI agent Eric (Abrahamson) and rich kid/entrepreneur Chas (Jenner) banded together in the early 2000's to find a way to rob the library, getaway from the investigation and sell their loot to the black market, but soon discovered the heist life is anything but what they've come to expect from their love of movies that inspired their actions.It's an intriguing set-up for Layton to build upon and one that would seem far-fetched if it weren't in fact a reality and the director has a ball playing with conventions as Animal's narrative plays out with increasing energy and scope, whilst the real life heist gang recount their journey in a talking heads manner, that at times blurs into the film going on around it.As time wear's on it also becomes clearer that Layton isn't so much interested in the undertakings of the heist (even though the planning stages and execution are well-handed) but more-so the true meaning of what this heist represented for these young men, which gives Animal's further differential's compared with other heist film's and also gives it a beating heart, that may not be apparent at first but certainly is come the films latter moments.Final Say -A heist film with a difference, American Animal's is another standout piece of work from Layton, that when combined with solid work from its acting cast and unique structure with its real life subjects becomes one of the years more memorable and enjoyable outings.4 Amsterdam trips out of 5",American Animals
16,paul-allaer,So much better than that other recent heist caper movie,8,24 June 2018,"""American Animals"" (2018 release; 116 min.) ""is not based on a true story. It is a true story"", we are reminded at the beginning. As the film opens, we see a guy putting make up on, while cutting back and forth with various people who comment how unexpected these events were, and totally out of character with the kids (they thought) they raised. Just as 4 guys are about to commit what seems like a robbery, we then go back to ""18 months earlier"", where in Fall, 2003, Transylvania University (Lexington, KY) student Spencer Reinhard befriends Warren, an up to no good, bored guy who is desperate for something big to happen in his life. When Spencer mentions that the university library holds rare books from the likes of Audubon and Darwin, they hatch a plan to rob the library... At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the (real life) plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: when I saw that British writer-director Bart Layton (best known for his documentary ""The Imposter"", which I had as one of the top movies of 2012) was associated with this film, I immediately knew chances were very good that ""American Animals"" would be tops. Turns out that Layton indeed has delivered again. He brings us a real life incident and its aftermath in 2003-4 which I have no recollection of (and I live just 90 mi. north of Lexington), but that doesn't mean it isn't any less true or riveting. Layton made a crucial decision to inter-cut the film with interviews of the actual people, so yes we do get to see the real Spencer, Warren and several other key people. it only underscores that this isn't some Hollywood heist fantasy, but real people and real events. In that sense, the contrast between ""American Animals"" and the recently released ""Ocean's 8"" couldn't be starker. While ""Ocean's 8"" is super-smooth yet utterly predictable and not believable (sorry, Sandra Bullock), ""American Animals"" is the exact opposite: not smooth at all, in fact gritty at times, yes very real and certainly believable. Layton's casting works great, in particular Barry Keoghan (as Spencer), who just keeps racking up the top performances (after ""Dunkirk"" and ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"", now this). Last, but certainly not least, while yes, this is a heist movie, it also deals with underlying social issues in ways that the ""Ocean's 8"" makers can only dram of.""American Animals"" premiered at this year's Sundance Film Festival to positive buzz, and having seen the trailer recently, I couldn't wait to see it. The film finally opened on 3 screens in Greater Cincinnati. The Saturday matinee were I saw this at was attended so-so (about 10 people). It's a darn shame that an under the radar but top notch movie like this can't get greater exposure in the theater, but hopefully it will find a wider audience on other platforms. I'd readily suggest you check out ""American Animals"", be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",American Animals

Four college friends unite & concoct to rob some extremely valuable tomes from the university's library since they feel their lives, up until that point, were going nowhere & this robbery perhaps may be the kick in the pants they needed. By deftly mixing footage of the lead up to & the eventual theft w/interviews w/the actual participants, the film achieves a uniquely entertaining & maybe biased take on the events (some of the thieves can't recall who actually brought who in or even if some crucial meetings actually took place) which affords the viewer an edge of their seat vantage point where we're not sure if what's being dramatized can be scrutinized w/any sort of truthful lens.

23,questl-18592,Library Heist,7,4 April 2021,"This is an interesting movie to write a review for. I didn't love it but wow is it incredibly put together and I super appreciate the style and choices they made here. American Animals isn't a typically structured movie. Rather than being a standard procession of events portrayed by the actors it flits back and forth between the portrayals and the testimonial narrative of the actual people this is about. The way it plays with that idea of their retelling of the events and how their varied perspectives sometimes play with the portrayal we're given is a fascinating experience and one that I will likely go back to in the future.Yeah, I think that's where I really come down on this. I want to love this movie because of how much I'm fascinated by the way it chose to tell it's story but it just didn't click with me, which is disappointing. It's just slightly off for some reason for me and I think it's because that style is so cool and the rest of the movie just didn't live up to it for me. Even though the performances were solid, it just didn't stick the landing perfectly. I still think this is worth checking out for most people, if only for the experience of a different kind of movie.",American Animals
24,truemythmedia,Smart and Stylish,9,23 May 2019,"This movie was a ton of fun. During my viewing, I kept thinking back to last year's ""Baby Driver"", another really stylish heist film; both films have great soundtracks, boast flashy directing, and have some innovative plot devises and story elements. Perhaps the coolest part of this movie, however, is the true story behind this film. The actual people who planned this heist, a couple of their parents, the librarian, and a teacher are all interviewed over the course of the film, and they tell their stories while the events unfold before our eyes. That seamless interweaving of real interviews and reenacted footage starring Hollywood stars is something that I haven't really seen before, and it actually works surprisingly well throughout.

25,AudioFileZ,Excellent Heist Caper With Reality and Repercussions,9,16 August 2018,"American Animals took me by surprise. I wasn't familiar with the true back-story about the events depicted in the film. I can accept it's a film and there may be deviations from the actual events at times. That said the movie feels like a very welcome blend of a documentary and a heist movie. While it's no action blockbuster it reaches a fine level of entertainment by well placed actual interviews with the real perpetrators and a fantastic sense of humor. It's still a black atmosphere as a level headed person watching just wants to shake the main characters and say ""wake-up"". The idea is so stupid, but it gets the point that within a person who is fairly intelligent, yet bored, there's a need for some kind of excitement. Most folks get involved with less benign ways of course. Here things go toward the unthinkable, at least in logical terms. This is the hook. The movie weaves the decent of these smart kids fantasies slowly becoming reality. It builds tension, and all without the usual Hollywood heist bombast. It's really sad, but since you see it as a voyeur it's safe and engaging. I do like heist flicks and I do feel Hollywood has actually ruined the genre more than ran with it. This is a film that gets so much across about the angst and unsavory elements it's actually a refreshing take on the genre. Plus it tells an interesting true crime story and as such still should reach a broad audience. I give the writers, director, and the actors kudos for stealing back the heist genre and doing with originality and aplomb. In the end you really feel sad for the mis-guided actions of four young men and the aftermath that will always remain with the librarian victim and the families who received such a shock.",American Animals

29,classicalsteve,A Seemingly Innocent Heist of Rare Books Becomes Deadly Serious,8,14 August 2019,"Everyone knows about rare and fine art: Picasso's, Rembrandt's, Da Vinci's. When an art heist takes place it often gets top story news. But what about a rare book heist? One of the most valuable books in the world, which is really a hybrid between rare books and fine art is Audubon's The Birds of America. Audubon created about 120 copies of nearly 450 engravings of birds which he then hand-colored. Most copies have been broken apart. The small number of copies which remain intact with all of the engravings often sell at auction for about $12 million. Individual hand-colored prints can be worth anywhere from $20,000 to $200,000.Four over-their-head college students decide to pilfer Transylvania University's copy of Audubon's Birds of America from their rare book/special collections room at their library. They think they're smarter than the library. Only a door, case and librarian are standing in the way of their acquiring these volumes. There's also a first edition of ""Origin of Species"", worth about $150,000. They also own a late medieval codex with miniatures and hand-illumination, probably worth $500,000 to $1 million.The story is told quasi-documentary style with actors playing the four heisters and the real people telling how they remember the story. Evan Peters plays Warren Lipka, the ring-leader, Barry Keoghan as Spencer Reinhard, the youngest and most uneasy of the group, Blake Jenner as Chas Allen, the get-away driver, and Jared Abrahamson as Eric Borsuk, an accounting student who will help with the logistics. Ann Dowd has a small part as Betty Jean ""BJ"" Gooch, the librarian.Lipka and Reinhard are the first to dream up the plan. They go on a wild goose chase which takes them to New York and then Lipka to Amsterdam, where they hope to secure buyer interest in the rare books on the black market. They realize they need help to pull off the heist, so they solicit help from two fellow college students, allen and Borsuk. Even when trying to decide how to pull off the heist, they seem over their heads. They use colors, such as Mr. Black and Mr. Pink to identify each other, like the film Reservoir Dogs. Their initial idea is to dress in disguises looking like Ivy League professors.What starts out as a seemingly somewhat playful game until they finally enact the heist which becomes deadly serious. The outcome is worth the price of admission. One of my favorite rationalizations made is they plan to give the librarian $1000's when they sell the Audubon volumes. What they didn't know is that auction houses and rare booksellers, at least legitimate ones, will research items to make sure they're not on the black market.",American Animals

31,Aktham_Tashtush,One of the most underrated movies this year so far ..,8,14 August 2018,"Just a sensational story ,, The script writing is brilliant ,, but the most noticeable was the Directing !!! Bart Layton did both and he did one amazing job.. bringing up the characters themselves telling their side of the story was a nice touch.Casting Evan Peters and Barry Keoghan was a good move ,, they are both rising stars and they take the job seriously , and here they were engaging and so convincing.Now my issue is ... the movie went on the big screen at the beginning of this year , toured all around the world festivals, and premiered 1st of June on movie theaters ,, yet .. no sound what so ever ,, the marketing is so bad for this movie ,, or it is hated for some reason ,,, or maybe the critics think this is in a way glorifying crime ""which isn't""...

32,rockman182,American Animals (2018),7,5 June 2018,"Everyone knows I love Moviepass so I had to check out the first film from MoviePass Ventures. I generally love heist movies. Whether they are serious or have a comedic element to it, if done right it could be very worthwhile. With American Animals I didn't know what to expect because I decided to go in blind without any knowledge or expectations. The film offers a different but effective method of storytelling and is fairly intense. Its good.The film covers the true story of four young men who decide to steal a book of rare prints and books from a library at Transylvania University. The film covers the group meeting each other, how they plan out the job, the actual recreation of the event, and the aftermath and effects of the crime. The film blends recreation with real life documentary style input of the real four men who committed the crime. I thought having the men tell the story to the camera throughout the film, would be distracting. It wasn't though. It was actually very welcome to see the real faces of the men who committed the incident and the emotional toll it took. I think the cinematography is gritty at times, the camera is in your face and does well to convey the real consequences and feelings associated with the event. I found elements of the actual crime funny, though I don't think it was meant to be.The stakes are not high in this film. Apart from the lives of the four men being ruined, there isn't that much more at stake. This was refreshing and kept the film loose and slightly not serious, despite being a serious film. It goes without saying that the film is also very well acted. There's a few familiar faces, and all act the part. Its a fun film that really gets into top gear when the robbery attempt occurs.7.5/10",American Animals
33,cultfilmfan,American Animals,9,8 July 2018,"American Animals, falls into a select group of films through no fault of the film itself, has been reduced to a pretty bare bones and very limited release just playing in a handful of theatres across North America. Having just seen the film last night, I was wondering as I was watching it why the film's distributor didn't choose to be a bit more adventurous and give the film a wide release. Was it because the distributor only has certain amount of seats allotted to them, or was it not a finanically viable option? Either way, I think that even if the film's current distribution company couldn't for whatever reason give it a wide theatrical release that any number of big players could very easily have done so and I could almost guarantee that with the right marketing and with the positive reviews and word of mouth that the film already has going for it, that it could become quite a hit and the reason that it hasn't already done so is because for most people it is not playing in theatres that are anywhere close to where they live, so henceforth leaving the option of either driving a long distance to see it, or catch it when it becomes available on streaming. I think more major studios need to take bigger risks by releasing films like this because I think they would score more with audiences than they think they would. Anyone now can tell you that their basic movie multiplex is full of all the lastest Marvel, Star Wars and superhero films which do seem to take in a large amount of the money that the box office brings in, but I would encourage these major theatre chains as well to also cater to a smaller demographic and bring in films that maybe an older audience, or an audience who has far outgrown your usual Summer movie fare has to offer because for myself I find that within the last little while my theatre trips are becoming less and less frequent for the simple reason that there is nothing worthwhile playing and I am so very fortunate when a film like American Animals does come along to have a much needed break from the normal fare that is out at this time of year. The film is based on a true story and combining aspects of a documentary as well as the film being a fully realized and played out drama, it becomes one of the most fascinating as well as entertaining films of this year and what the cinema has had to offer lately. I was quite impressed by the film's overall style with it's mix of 60's and 70's musical tunes as well as flashing between the past and to the present where we see the real life perpetrators of the crime depicted in the film in reality and get to see their thoughts and opinions about what made them decide to do what they did and also giving us a look at basically these characters had for the most part everything going right for them in an academic, or career oriented way and just out of sheer boredom, or really having nothing else to do, came this not very well thought out idea of pulling off a heist at their local university library. Whether the following events were true, or not, either way the film makes for some of the most thrilling times you are bound to see in a theatre thus far this year and it has a great mix of comedic scenes, drama as well as a good sense of suspense and timing when the said heist is actually attempted. The young actors here who I am mostly unfamiliar with all do a very commendable job of showing you what drives them to do this event all at the same time showing that we can not always figure out the reason they did it. The parents don't seem to be overly involved in the film, but whether that was factual, or just an aspect they didn't seem to show I don't know. One of the main characters we see his parents living in a very strained and dysfunctional relationship that later leads to divorce and you can't help but wonder if that had any effect on the decisions that this character would later make in the film. Otherwise these characters seemed to be bored and had little else going on in life and as we hear from their very own mouths, we see that they regret the decision to ever get involved in these events and if they had sitten down and thought rationally, or talked to an older, or more mature person, these events most likely would not have been carried out. It is a fascinating yet disturibing look at society and what makes and triggers people to do the things that so often destroy not only ourselves but those and our society around us. American Animals doesn't try by answering any of these questions, but instead takes us on a thrilling ride that is just as much for contemplation as it is for entertainment and with that perfect balance it becomes one of this year's must see films.",American Animals

Another Kentuckian sued me to force me to take down a brand new fence. Another realtor while showing my house had gay sex in my kitchen. A handyman I hired to fix a door stole the door. Another handyman stole three kitchen knives. Yard workers don't show up. My neighbors across from me are both severe drunks as are most of the others.

38,springfieldrental,Layton's Work a Homage To Past Directors' Magic,9,27 June 2018,"There are certain movies you enter knowing very little about, both from a plot standpoint as well as who the director is, and ultimately become pleasantly surprised by its end result. Such is the motion picture written and directed by one Bart Layton named ""American Animals."" I never heard of Mr. Layton before. His resume is rather thin, yet the capacity this man brings to the screen shows that he's a talent that will make his mark in cinema for many years to come. In AA, his mix of injecting the interviews of the real life participants among the actors' actions was ingenious and gave his narrative an extra layer of understanding the motives behind the actual events. His script's pacing was rapid throughout, accelerating a plot that normally would have had the potential of bogging down.And Layton's knowledge of cinematic arts is patently evident throughout. He leans on Stanley Kubrick in selecting a Malcomb McDowell (""Clockwork Orange"") lookalike in lead actor Evan Peters as well as inserts an actual clip from Kubrick's 1956 ""The Killing."" The tension right before the heist where a robber is sharpening a pencil inside the library is a direct takeoff of Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon A Time in The West"" classic opening. Also, Layton's Steven Spielberg references to ""Jaws"" as well as showcasing several of Spielberg's (and Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"") track/rack ""Jaws Shot"" smartly elevates this movie above the normal cookie-cutter heist films. In the informative book ""The 15 Geniuses Behind The Lens: How The Greatest Film Directors Shaped The Movies We See Today,"" the reader can see Layton's magic on the screen being influenced by the past masters.Lastly, I can't say enough of the team of four editor's post-production skills. Not only do they expertly follow Layton's demanding call for rapid edits, but the inventive use of cross-cutting and both invisible and visible wipes shows the editors heightened the director's vision to give this film an extra edge of aesthetic appeal. Very well done.",American Animals
39,AhmedSpielberg99,American Pets!,7,30 August 2018,"Aside from the committed, and decent performances from the entire cast, most notably from Evan Peters who proves that he's one of the most talented young actors around, it's the movie's third act that made me barely like American Animals. The last act has some of the best hold-your-breath scenes I've seen this year. Case in point, the entire robbery sequence that really got on my nerves. Due to the impeccable editing, especially the sound editing in the mentioned scene, the movie left me mostly satisfied despite all its flaws, or maybe it's only one grave flaw that causes the others.Fine acting, superb editing, perfect use of the soundtrack, and good cinematography. That's all the good this movie has throughout its entire runtime. So let's talk about the issues I've with American Animals. For starters, using the documentary style, and showing different opinions is a risky decision that if it was used wrong would be nothing but a cheap gimmick to get the attention. I, Tonya used a similar technique last year and it was good for the most part, I actually thought it would have been better if it made much use of it, but here it wasn't just useless, and didn't add to the characters, or serve the plot, but it also was very distracting and off-putting.The second issue is that the movie never settles on one way to tell its story. It starts using this documentary style, which I thought it was interesting and promising at first, then the movie almost neglected this style or rather the most interesting part of it which is the different point of views, and what we got were some interrupting scenes of the real four young men explaining and justifying what they were feeling at these particular moments, and why they were doing so. I mean really! Is that how to tell a story, and develop the characters?!The planning for the heist, and collecting the gang were kinda interesting. But after that, the movie chose a formulaic way to keep going; such as, the let-downs, and the regrets. And while these phase showed glimpses of adding real depth to the characters, a thing that was almost made me ignore the clichés, almost every dramatic moments felt forced, and the movie just didn't give enough time or prepared for these potentially affective scenes. Let alone the interrupting documentary that did nothing but preventing me from being invested even for a moment.Comparing what I've praised to what I've criticized, I usually would a movie like this 3 stars, 6 to 6.5 out of 10, but this above-mentioned robbery scene blew me away. It has Fincher's rebelliousness, and Aronofsky's uneasiness mixed together but without being offensive. With that said, I can't give American Animals less than....(7/10)",American Animals

49,david-meldrum,A True Life Drama/Documentary That's As Gripping As The Big Questions It Raises Are Pertinent,8,17 May 2019,"Have you ever watched someone you love barrel headlong into a potential life-ruining mistake and been powerless to do anything about it? If you have, you'll know it's an excruciating experience. Part of love and leadership and mentoring and training, of course, is allowing people to make mistakes and be there to pick them up afterwards, help them put themselves back together and make sure everything is manageable afterwards. As a parent, and as someone who has spent my whole working life thus far working with people, I spend a lot of time watching people I have varying degrees of responsibility for make mistakes and have to live with the consequences. Often I see the mistakes coming, and I'm a powerless to stop them - even if I've tried my best to help them see the potential consequences. It's a strange, cringing, disempowering experience.That's what floated around my mind as I watched 2018's American Animals, an at once thrilling and cringe-inducing heist-movie and documentary. It tells the true story of some bored young men in Kentucky, some of them college students, who tried to inject excitement in to their lives by attempting to steal some immensely valuable books; as the story is told, the drama is intercut with footage of the real people involved - the young men, parents and a few others, retelling their story, and their tragic, life-ruining mistakes.The young men's arrogance and self-importance seems staggering at times; the film follows some of the classic tropes of a heist movie, so when we see them assigning and arguing over the code names 'Mr Pink' and 'Mr Brown', and so on, in exactly the same way as Reservoir Dogs, we can only assume it's a satirical invention of the film-maker. As one of the characters points out, that's a film that didn't end well for anyone involved. It's jaw-dropping to discover, however, that this is no fictionalisation. They really did that; and we wonder that they ever thought they would do this.The film builds relentlessly to the actual heist; one or two of the characters reflecting on the chances they had to walk away, but never took. But they were bored - so very bored with what they had, with what lay ahead of them and what was expected of them - that they felt this was something they had to do. As one of them says: ""I realised I had to make something happen on my own.""; as another says to an authority figure ""This whole place (college) and goddamned town is a disappointment.""So with the arrogant naivety of the young, the heist comes along, a lengthy sequence which, along with its aftermath, is as thrilling as it is painful and sometimes absurdly funny to watch. You're watching people ruin their lives - and that of others - for a thrill, an experience, and there's nothing we can do to stop them. Have they learned anything by the end? That's unclear - but they're certainly regretful.It's easy to criticise these young men; and they deserve it, of course. But we need a word of caution to ourselves. How many of us have ever placed expectations on ourselves or others, not allowing the people carrying those expectations to show doubt, fear, weakness or a desire to take a different path? These young men are crushed by the apparent safety and predictability of middle-class suburban niceness and predictability; there seems to be no-one, no parent, no teacher, no coach, no pastor, no friend to whom they can express doubt or a hint of darkness in themselves. No one will hear they want to do or be something or someone else. No one who will listen to their hints of darkness and rob that darkness of its power by confessing 'Me as well', before it erupts as it does in to something all together more dangerous.Wanting to have it all together, to be seen to be becoming or to actually be 'a success' (as much for our children as ourselves) can kill people. Maybe it can literally kill them; or maybe just kill the light and life in them until they whither away in to quiet safety, never rocking a boat that may be heading for an iceberg. Churches are rife with it; schools; universities; and especially the crushingly predictable environments of polite white-collar jobs that keep everyone safe but many unsatisfied.It's ironic especially to find such crushing safety and hidden darkness in churches and Christ-followers; one of the few qualifications for following Jesus is to admit our helplessness over our own darknesses. Church communities should, then, be places where people know they're all broken and can talk about our brokenness with one another; even, or especially, the pastor, But so often they're not, despite a prayer of confession being a regular feature of many worship services, true weakness and darkness is rarely confessed by any - and then when a pastor or a church member truly crashes or fails, there's wide-spread shock and precious little grace to welcome back.On their album reflecting on the ennui and predictability of suburban life (The Suburbs), Arcade Fire sang ""I need the darkness/Someone please cut the light."" It's a plea to shut off the painful predictability of the suburban glow of artificial light, the better to see the stunning natural light of the stars against the night sky. It's also a cry for something more; there's darkness in me. Hear it, and own it, before it consumes me. What would have happened to these young men in American Animals if they - or someone around them - had the strength to allow them to voice their darkness and temptations, and rob them of their power? What would happen to you, our churches, to me, to our pastors, if we allowed confessions of weakness and fragility before they overwhelmed us? Are we strong enough to see we're all jars of clay?Such questions are almost as hard to ask as they are to answer. Perhaps, however, in voicing them together we will find some the light we need.",American Animals
50,steiner-sam,Impossible to feel much empathy for these guys,7,14 October 2021,"It's a heist movie set in 2003-2004 in Lexington, Kentucky. It follows four college students who plot and carry out a robbery of rare books from the special collections section of the Transylvania University Library. It's based on the true story and includes fragments of interviews with the four men, a former professor, the librarian who is attacked during the robbery, and some of the students' parents. These interview fragments are interspersed throughout the film.Spencer Reinhart (Barry Keoghan), an art student, and Warren Lipka (Evan Peters), an athletic scholarship student initiate the plot. They bring Eric Borsuk (Jared Abrahamson), an accounting student into the plot to help with analysis and logistics. Finally, these three bring in Chas Allen III (Blake Jenner), a wealthy student to serve as the getaway driver.The targets are four double-sized folios of John James Audubon's ""Birds of America"" and early work by Charles Darwin. The film reflects occasional ""second thoughts"" during the detailed planning that lasted almost a year, the incompetence of the planning, and the differing memories of what actually happened.At one level, ""American Animals"" (the title is derived from a Darwin quote) shows the complexities of the plotters' relationships and the tension in carrying out the theft.Years later, the plotters tend to blame one person and explain it all as an effort to make a dramatic change in their lives. They claim they never wanted to hurt anyone.As a retired librarian who administered a special collection, I'm offended by the meaninglessness and crassness of it all. One wonders what these guys might have accomplished if their ""big change"" related to social justice. It's impossible to feel much empathy for them, but on the other hand, it reminded me of some of my own aimlessness and struggle for change as a college student.Generating that internal ambivalence within me generates as high a rating as I give it.",American Animals

53,asifahsankhan,A very stylish heist film,8,16 August 2018,"The heist genre is one that's been done to death, but with American Animals, filmmaker Bart Layton manages to pull off something wholly unique. Best known as the director behind the wildly entertaining documentary The Imposter, Layton brings his non-fiction background with him to his first narrative feature film, interlacing the movie's fictional portrayal of events with interviews with the real-life subjects. The effect is engaging, offering a self-reflection not often seen in crime films, and while the movie ends up hollow in some spots, the cast is terrific and Layton announces himself as a filmmaker to watch.When American Animals begins, text appears on the screen stating ""This Is Not Based on a True Story,"" but after a few seconds the ""Not Based on"" drops out, and we're left with ""This Is a True Story."" The film chronicles the real-life heist of precious rare books from Transylvania University in 2004 Kentucky, pulled off by a quartet of mostly well-off college students. The central mastermind duo behind the heist is Spencer (Barry Keoghan), a talented young art student, and his adrenaline-fueled troublemaking best friend Warren (Evan Peters). First pitched as something of a joke, the two begin to meticulously plan a heist of a couple of rare books kept in a secure library on the Transylvania University campus. Spencer is spurred by the notion that all great artists had to endure some kind of hardship to become great, and he's lived a perfectly nice family life. Warren, meanwhile, is a bit of a free spirit, spurred to act mostly out of the desire to see if they could actually pull this off.From the get-go, Layton establishes a slick framing device that sets this movie apart. Keoghan-who had a tremendous 2017 with breakout turns in Dunkirk and The Killing of a Sacred Deer-may start a sentence as Spencer, but the camera will then swiftly move right to reveal the real Spencer, finishing the character's sentence. All of the major players involved in the real-life heist show up as part of these interviews, and it's kind of like I, Tonya if the framing interviews were the real people. American Animals uses this device to address the idea that one individual's recollection of events may be completely different than another's, but more importantly it adds a layer of self-reflexivity that's much welcomed.Indeed, the biggest turnoff of American Animals is we don't really understand why these idiot college students did what they did. It was a flawed plan from the get-go, they weren't particularly hurting for money, and one of them came from a supremely wealthy family. So it's hard to get invested in the planning of the heist-which takes up the bulk of the film-when you don't really care if these guys succeed or not. It's here where the interviews play the most crucial role, as the real-life counterparts in hindsight provide perspective regarding just how idiotic and harmful this whole pie-in-the-sky idea really was.",American Animals

56,Lewis_Heather787,A complete surprise !,8,9 September 2018,"I completely missed the trailer for this film, so I had absolutely no expectations going into the film. I didn't even know what the film was about, I just saw the title and thought it was worth a watch. Wow was I not prepared for this film, I had no idea that this was a true story, this is definitely going to be one of the most underrated films of the year for sure.There are many positives.Firstly the directing is fantastic across the board, Bart Layton has crafted a brilliant looking film that oozes style and quirkiness. One of the greatest triumphs of the film is the use of the real life people narrating the film as it goes along. Reminds me a lot of ""I,Tonya"" and again here in this film it works so perfectly because all of there accounts that they are giving are contradicting each other. This sets up for some brilliant comedy and humour throughout the film that is used perfectly, not to much and not to little. This links directly into another positive which is the writing. The dialogue between the characters is fantastic, it seems so genuine and realistic as to how someone would react and say in those situations. Witty, charming and wildly idiotic the dialogue between the two main characters Spencer and Warren is off the chart good. However I must say that the whole groups interactions and dialogue will have you laughing out loud. Even thought I have mentioned the film is very funny in places there is also a more serious under current to the film which takes centre stage more towards the end of the film. It is extremely powerful and emotional once you find out what happened to them and very rewarding for the audience. The screenplay of the film handles the serious and light subjects matters very carefully and very well.The last positive I have is the cast which is fantastic use of up and coming actors that deserve their chance on the big screen. Although I would say that Evan Peters has had he share of big films or far, he has never really stood out so much for me in a film then he does in this. It is a fantastic role to play because the guy is a complete idiot but very likeable at the same time. The other acting standout has to be Barry Keoghan, he is only adding to his resume. He is more or less the focal point of the film from the outset and carries the film really well. His chemistry with Evan Peters is really good and you believe that their friendship is genuine.Overall this film is very good 80% out of 100 or 8 out of 10. A ridiculous story that happens to be true, gets funnier and more stupid as it goes along. A real entertaining heist film with a great use of the real people involved commenting on the film. Only negative I have is the film can drag here and there, it probably could have been slightly shorter but overall really good. I have no doubt that this will be one of the most underrated films of the year because where is the marketing for this film?!?",American Animals
57,ccorral419,American Animals gives you no time to breath,10,5 July 2018,"Documentarian/Producer and Director/Writer here, British born Bart Layton (""Locked Up Abroad"" TV) has gathered an outstanding ensemble of actors (Even Peters ""POSE,"" Barry Keoghan "" Dunkirk,"" Blake Jenner "" Edge of Seventeen,"" Jared Abrahamsson ""Travelers"" TV, Ann Dowd ""Hereditary"") who decided to up their boring and disenfranchised lives by stealing historical and financially strong books from their local Lexington KY University. Together, they are a train wreck waiting to happen, and one you can't look away from. Layton does an amazing job intertwining the story leading up to and through the heist, with actual interviews with the four (now grown men) who lived the experience first hand. By presenting all versions of the expereince, the audience becomes vested in the presentation. Unfortunately, Librarian Betty Jean (BJ) Gooch must bare the burden of being in the boys way, yet the always excellent Ann Dowd is up for the interaction. Score by Anne Nikitin helps establish the sentiment of the film and the pending action. Cinematography by Ole Bratt Kirkland further establish the community environment and the trapped feel the boys are dealing with, and the films Editing team (Nick Fenton, 
Chris Gill, Julian Hart) brings it all together into one exciting package. To Layton and the Editing teams credit, you won't be able to breath during the heist scene. Make sure to stick around for the credits, as musician Sixto Rodriguez (""Searching for Sugar Man"" 2012) performs the final credit score. Funny thing, his name is nowhere to be found in the credits.

58,js-66130,THE BOOK THIEVES,8,28 May 2018,"True story this, though the quartet of perpetrators of the most audacious literary crime have trouble keeping their story straight. That's part of the fun in recreating a 2004 Kentucky teenage heist: having the now grown ups involved, recount the events, separated by distance from each other, and time from the deed.""American Animals"" seems too goofy for fact, but as usual, fiction loses out in the strange category. Spencer, Warren, Eric and Chas, (yes Chas), are privileged white boys getting their feet wet at University, itching for the action adult life has promised, which of course, is lacking. Solution: robbery! Seems the campus library has a twelve million dollar book, and the only obstacle is an elderly librarian. Seeing their fair share of heist movies, the greedy group hatch an elaborate plan to snatch a big bird book from the poorly guarded nest. Convoluted schematics are drawn up. Maquettes are constructed. Ridiculous disguises are made. This is the thrill of their lives, and makes for irresistible film.Evan Peters as the excitable and sketchy Warren, owns his delicious role, especially when steering the reluctant dreamer Spencer (Barry Keoghan) to the point of no return. Even better are their real counterparts, as they contemplate on the events, and each other, fourteens years on.

I despise modern trailers. Was a mis-step to use the pseudo-docu style of using the real people as intercut talking-heads. It kills the immersion. You constantly compare the actors, and are reminded all the while they're just acting. Cinema should allow you to lose these thoughts to engage with the story more. It would have worked MUCH BETTER as a satire, like Pain and Gain, or Four Lions, a kind of Fight-Club-esque story of these young, empty, attention-seekers spawned by a generation where everyone has to be unique and special, fumbling around like morons and ending up in jail.",American Animals

64,RMurray847,"Wow, this hilarious and incredibly tense movie is one of the best of 2018",8,8 January 2021,"I expected some of the elements of this movie: a heist put together by amateurs with more guts than brains, an exploration of young manhood in the post-911 era, a sprinkling of humor and some good performances. I did not expect to find this to be the most exciting and exhilarating film of the year so far. I knew it was a true story, but the ways in which this film shows you that ""trueness"" are extraordinary and surprisingly moving. There is a daring and a devil-may-care attitude about the filmmaking that makes it seem immediate and hastily shot...but that feeling was only created by careful planning and a director/writer with a vision.The film tells about 4 young men (I hesitate to call them friends, exactly) who convince themselves that they can pull of a heist. They will rob the library of a Kentucky university, stealing several valuable books, including Audubon's original portfolios. Estimated value north of $12 million. Each (mostly) has misgivings, but each is either spoiled enough or bored enough to sign on. The scenes of planning are often crazily hilarious, and both entertain and make you realize that these guys are very unlikely to pull it off. Each character is well drawn, and the two lead characters are particularly well presented. When the heist itself comes, the tension levels are VERY high. No OCEAN'S movie could ever hope to come near the edge-of-the-seat intensity of the last 30 minutes or more of this film.The film explores what drives these men to try this: stupidity, eagerness to take themselves to the edge, a conviction that life owes them something and a disdain for society. Mostly there is a pervading sense of entitlement. And after the heist, when the consequences finally sink in and they have to face what they've actually done...there is a strong sense of the self-loathing, guilt, and general ""why did I just do that"" feeling each shares. It is good stuff. The film is wildly funny at times, terrifically tense at others and never less than 100% gripping. Within one minute of the start, the film had me hooked, and not for a minute did I feel out from under the vision of the filmmakers. Great performances of a great script, and all technical aspects working nearly perfectly to maximize everything the film was trying to say.Highly, HIGHLY recommended.",American Animals

67,robertmaybeth,"Tries hard but can't deliver, it's a cringe-fest of stupidity",4,10 July 2018,"I admire the film-makers for choosing the pseudo-documentary style and trying to do something new with it. That said, this movie is D+ in every way and it'd be the very last choice I'd have to watch (narrowly edging out a test pattern).""Animals"" is based on a true story and the real people are really in it. The problem here is the story makes a marginally adequate script that would need to be fleshed out with something or someone unique or ground breaking to make it really work. Instead it's a story of four not-too-smart young men, none of whom has anything compelling, or even remotely interesting about them. None of them are facing any sort of desperate situation that would push them to crime (drug addiction, debt, etc.) and their only motive for committing the crime in this movie seems to be boredom. So this train doesn't have enough momentum to push it over into even being mildly entertaining - instead it's a cringe-fest of stupidity. Even the music tries to get in on the story; the score is always there to tell us in big bold terms what we ought to be feeling. But ultimately ""Animals"" is just disappointing. Their crime is stupid, their motives are stupid, even the method of carrying it out is stupid, and so it came to the point where I myself felt, well STUPID - and even a bit guilty for watching them botching things so horribly. The 4 men in this story have chemistry, of sorts, but ultimately I found it very difficult to even care what happened to them. If the point here is as a lesson for how NOT to commit crime, this movie succeeds in sending that message loud and clear. All in all though, ""Animals"" is more cringey then entertaining: it's unpleasant to watch, there's not enough humor, the characters are lifeless and dull. This movie has few/no redeeming qualities. If I had it to watch over again I wouldn't - it's not a good use of your time.",American Animals

And that also includes being the most innovative, as I can't think of any other movie-from any other year-that's been presented in such a unique way.Writer-director Bart Layton presents the film as a hybrid between narrative and documentary, perhaps 80-20, by laying out the story but also cutting away to the real life people who were involved with the situation for their thoughts and reflections on what happened.The main reason why 'American Animals' is so effective is that it focuses on the tension and anxiety these kids are feeling before the heist ... and the mixture of dread and regret afterwards.

The movie is carried by the amazing talent of the main actors, especially Barry Koaghan who plays Spencer. The confusion and uncertainty are omnipresent in these young minds and it makes them so human even though they are committing a crime. This movie is really intense and can be difficult to watch.The best thing is that it doesn't even feel like a movie, the mistakes made by Spencer and his friends create a realistic and frightening tone.

The semi-documentary style, blending interviews with the actual guys who did it with the narrative film worked pretty well for me.The real problem is that it's just not that interesting to watch idiots do idiot things for idiot reasons. The best reason any of these fools can come up with for why they wanted to do it is ""to find out what would happen if they did it in real life."" The answer, a big surprise to no one but them, is: ""7 years in federal prison.""As for their plan itself, it was never anything but terrible, and at no point watching them plan it out will the audience think for a second that it ever could have succeeded. As I stated before, this is the kind of plan conceived by idiot stoners while high, that any sober witness, or the stoners themselves once they sober up, will immediately realize is utterly stupid. Apparently these four were just so perpetually high or naturally brain dead that they couldn't see the stupidity that even most ten year olds would have recognized almost instantly.So we watch a bunch of idiots bungle through planning the dumbest heist in history, then manage to completely botch even their own idiot plan, and everything pretty much plays out exactly as you'd have expected from the beginning of the film. Maybe it would have worked better if it had been written as a comedy, but told as a heist/drama, it's just boring and kind of dumb, despite being well-put-together.It gets 5 stars as an ""Eh, it passed the time,"" but I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone, and I expect it'll be instantly forgettable, the kind of film I'll stumble across in a few years and won't remember I watched until I look up my IMDB rating of it.As a final note, the story behind this film does provide definitive proof that going to college and being successful there is in absolutely no way an indicator of intelligence.

85,PhilipGHarris,Building Waves,8,16 September 2018,"American Animals is a fascinating movie about a true robbery that went wrong due to the ineptitude of the villains. The film told by actors but having the real robbers, their families and victims appear in interview segments throughout the film, to explain their actions.What Bart Layton manages to create, as writer and director, is something that slowly hits you in waves of tension, as the theft slowly builds towards its expected failure. The villains of the piece particularly being made to appear inept and never heroic, and their actions and thinking clearly and methodically portrayed throughout. With brilliant portrayals from the four main cast members and Ann Dowd as Betty Jean.Whilst the film has humorous moments, Layton makes sure they are played respectfully and at the detriment of the villains and these become less as the tension grows. As the characters become absorbing in their failure to act out their plans, and the slow realisation that someone must be hurt in the process.This is certainly not everyone's type of movie, and will make some people - who have been victims or witness to crime - uncomfortable, but Layton strongly nods his understanding to the victims when the last spoken words are of the four 'American Animals' who show remorse and then by the real Betty Jean, who asks the honest question: If they crossed the line to harm a human, is that now part of their very nature.All the rest of the elements needed to assist this movie are there, with a well developed soundtrack, simple yet effective camera work and well designed sets and makeup. Where the film stands taller than others in the genre is the message it solidly gives. That crime can change the perpetrators and victims for the rest of their lives, and do we have the right to do that to another human.",American Animals

The slow build is expertly done, adding layer upon layer of tension as the gang move inexorably towards something it seems very few of them are actually thrilled to be a part of. We've all wondered what it would be like to buck the system, cross the line and taste life on the other side (or I have, anyway), and this film does such a great job of illustrating that drive and its inherent dangers. I simply do not understand the accusations of boredom and 1-2 star reviews on here.

In a way, I would call this film the unholy love-child of ""Ocean's Eleven"", ""The Social Network"" and ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"".The thing that sets this film apart from the others in its genre is just how REAL everything becomes by the time we watch these college kids, all aimless and without a clue, try to chase the American Dream through the most devious way possible. Spearheaded by spectacular leading performances by Barry Keoghan and Evan Peters, this film is not about a heist. Rather, this film is about nihilism, and growing-up in just about the scariest way possible.The film itself grows-up as we go, as we open with a sense of style and editing that is snappy and fast-paced. The style of young adult; alive and frantic. Everything is bright lights and pop songs, all while our protagonists see themselves as 'good guys' as they plot a heroic heist of a library and its priceless books. The theater I was in was happily rolling-along, audience laughing heartily with the silly antics.But suddenly, just as we as audiences want to see this heist succeed, and we suddenly see it unfold...the consequences hit. The laughing becomes weaker and weaker until we as audiences reach a similar realization as the characters do; this is real life.While the film's style of pseudo-documentary mixed with fiction was not exactly the most smoothly-executed (At times it felt jerky and almost gimmicky), it eventually comes back into play as the teaching tool of the entire film. The film's points it chooses to make, both light and dark, are powerful through this very medium. Its pacing and choices of editing, specifically a change by the second half that evolves the entire film into something completely different, were what flipped the proverbial coin for me as an audience member.The evolving state of this film, the proverbial 'growing-up' it symbolized to me as an audience member, was what truly made it impactful and transcended this film from a ""Good"" one to a ""Great"" one.This film is not about a heist. Rather, it is a film about growing-up THROUGH a heist. Indeed, as many billed it to be, ""American Animals"" is like no heist film before it. Thankfully, that's for all the right reasons.I seriously recommend seeing this indie darling of a film. While rough around the edges and lacking an entirely-bulletproof execution, I think this is one of the most interesting films I've seen thus far this year. It, quite literally, 'grows up' as you watch it.",American Animals

93,Marc_Horrickan,An honestly told tale of dishonesty,8,13 September 2018,"Bart Layton's follow-up to his critically-lauded docudrama THE IMPOSTOR weaves a similarly tricksy path between reality and fiction, but one that I found far more satisfyingly executed. With a charismatic cast, headed by Barry Keogh and Evan Peters, AMERICAN ANIMALS tells the story of a rare-book heist from a University library in Kentucky.Weaving together talking heads interviews with the seemingly repentant young robbers and gripping re-enactments of the events leading up to the heist, Layton reveals himself to be far more interested in the feel and shape of remorse than the crime itself. What is perhaps most remarkable about the film is the way in which the director manages to precisely judge the tonal shifts that the film takes. The opening half hour is all about the adrenal rush of planning and strategising a heist. The young robbers feel an urgent engagement with life that has hitherto been absent from their life. This section is all about giving pleasure and excitement. The actual heist itself is deferred gratification gone nightmarishly wrong, and Layton frames it as a frantic, messy and violent act. The aftermath has regret and remorse coursing through its every second - whilst simultaneously revealing the mechanisms at work throughout the film. An unusual crime caper, well told and with a very interesting take on notions of truth, culpability and remorse, this is one of my films of 2018, thus far.",American Animals

97,screenotes,Bart Layton is no imposter!,7,27 April 2019,"With American Animals (2018), writer / director Bart Layton deploys techniques he introduced in his excellent documentary The Imposter (2012) to create a biopic like no other, one that's actually entertaining. The true-crime story itself is interesting - 4 college boys who devise a plan to steal and sell priceless books from a college library - yet in lesser hands it's easy to see how it may have worn thin.It's not a documentary. Layton instead takes the opportunity to create a heist movie, revelling in the naïve and inept protagonists' discovery of the genre's tropes. Many an homage is paid to classics of the genre as the protagonists ""study"" for their heist by watching these films. Comedy ensues.The technique of intercutting talking head footage of the actual perpetrators and their family throughout the film at first seems gimmicky while setting up a comedic tone. However, the same technique provides for empathy with the characters involved and continually serves as a stark reminder that the events actually happened - and to seemingly ordinary people. It is far less a gimmick that it is a welcome short cut to the necessary insights required to tell a story from the point of view of the anti-heroes.",American Animals

100,hughrcarson,Suspenseful and brutally honest!,8,21 September 2018,"Spencer Reinhard was an art student at a Kentucky University, and it was there that he would meet the guy that would profoundly change his life, Warren Lipka; a free-spirit, and all-round loose cannon.Predictable college-related shenanigans aside, the pair shared a deep-seated need to make a name for themselves in life away from the binds of convention and conformity.Whilst Lipka was a hot-headed, disruptive influence, prone to making bad decisions, this in many ways appealed greatly to the impressionable Reinhard, who, like many of the great artists that he so admired, felt, himself, compelled to a life of sufferance.On viewing an assortment of prized rare books in their University's library, first Warren and then with minimal persuasion, Spencer, decided to hatch a far-fetched plan to steal the aforementioned valuables in what they believed would be the perfect heist.And having, soon after, persuaded an additional two friends to join them, the conspiring quartet then went about piecing together the constituent parts of what appeared on the surface at least to be a suspiciously straight forward job.And American Animals is the fascinating and unfortunate tale of how all of these best laid plans unravelled, spectacularly.Essentially a quasi-documentary of sorts, what sets Bart Layton's film apart from the plethora of heist movies that have made it to the big screen over the years, is the brutal honesty with which it is told. By frequently (and strategically) interjecting the main body of the film with the real life recollections of the heist's actual perpetrators, we are constantly reminded that this is, as the film makes very clear from the outset, a true story. Not just one based loosely upon real events.Unfortunately for them, what becomes abundantly clear is that the scheming foursome possessed next to none of the guile, nous or cojones required to pull off what would ultimately prove to be a very ambitious plan indeed. Far too ambitious for four college freshmen, it goes without saying. And it's this element of inevitable failure when combined with the surprisingly large amounts of empathy that one feels for these mis-guided characters, that makes Layton's film an at times excruciatingly tense experience. This was, after all, a plan as idiotic in its inception, as it proved to be shambolic in its execution.Some fine, nuanced performances from Evan Peters (Warren) and Barry Keoghan (Spencer) in particular, ensure that American Animals is both an engaging and impactful experience, but it's the cut-aways to the heist's real-life perpetrators that provide the real soul and emotional depth to this story.Considering none of them are actors by trade, the 'performances' and emotions conveyed to the camera by the real Spencer, Warren, Chas and Eric are refreshingly unstilted, and remarkably genuine and heartfelt in their delivery. Clearly to re-live these life-changing events has forced each of them into a very painful place in their souls in which guilt and shame seem both abundant and unrelenting.American Animals is a film that on one hand may well wag a finger of disapproval, but on balance, it remains surprisingly non-judgemental in its outlook. Perhaps the fact that four fools who, effectively hung by their own petard, chose then to lay bare their crimes, on camera, to the wider world, is considered to be judgement enough.And that's probably fair enough.Instead, Layton's film offers out an olive branch and wraps a consoling arm around the wrong-doers, choosing to look forward to the future rather than to dwell on the unfortunate misdemeanours of the past.This and hundreds of other titles are reviewed on my WaywardWolfBlog",American Animals

105,austincoleman-66971,A brilliant and effective mesh of two cinematic styles,9,7 April 2019,"I was skeptical and slightly confused from the jump. It would obviously be safer to choose to make this pure drama or documentary, but Layton (who is clearly in control the entire time) chooses to dip his toes in both. Somehow, it works seamlessly.The performances are great and being able to hear from the actual people at strategic times adds an element to characterization that many films can't achieve. We don't just get to see the bad choices made, but we get look inside what is behind those choices.Our four courageous characters do make stupid choices and are unlikable at times, but news flash: 90+% of kids their age think and sometimes act the same way. Not being able to support their actions should not detract from the quality of the film, since it doesn't even seem like they are heralded as heroes because of what they did, but rather how they have grown from it over a decade later.Ultimately, American Animals is a story of redemption. We see these four students wrestle with a fear that so many emerging adults can identify with: being ordinary. How they decided to overcome this fear had major consequences, and being able to hear from them personally takes us inside their hearts and minds in a way that wouldn't otherwise get us there.Clearly, the boys feel regret for what they did even in the midst of exciting ambition. Nearly 15 years later, they are continuing to learn from the biggest mistake of their lives and doing the best they can to turn it into something good.American Animals is about as authentic as a film can come. The fact that this is not a fictional story is amazing, and the way it is told invites us to put ourselves in the characters shoes. If we choose to do so, there is much to be learned.",American Animals

It adds a whole new level to the movie that adds more realism and more tension as well. The people who attempt a heist are not professionals and you can feel it. Speaking of tension, there are some legitimately tense and uncomfortable scenes in this movie that I really loved.The characters were great and well built, with the real people adding more depth to the characters the actors play. The cast also helps to make the characters likeable even when some of them shouldn't be and makes you get involved in what's happening.Overall, I loved every part of this movie from the characters to the heist and I would reccomend this to anyone.

110,heyitskeane,Truly sensational.,9,27 September 2018,"American Animals (2018), directed by Bart Layton, is truly sensational. It's thrilling, compelling and gripping, with its dark and poignant theme along with the brilliant directing of the film.American Animals tells the (true) story of 4 friends who seek an extraordinary life, and they plan to achieve that through robbing the library of Transylvania University, which contains some of the rarest (and most valuable) books in the world.This movie is definetely one of the best in 2018. And yes it is underrated. The directing and cinematography of this movie is just astounding. Almost every scene is just striking. You have shots, pans and angles which are just taken magnificently and you just watch it in awe because its just so well done. The opening scene of the film is just everything an opening scene should be. It immediately draws the viewers attention and builds on it with increasing tension. The film also has this inclusion of interviews of the actual people who were involved in the heist (Spencer Reinhard, Warren Lipka etc.) to give an factual, documentary-like vibe towards the film, and I think its just brilliant. Bart Layton uses his skills and experience in this field from his previous film, The Imposter (2012), and it just results in a very unique and entertaining experience.The performances and characterisation in the film are very compelling and engaging. Evan Peters plays Warren Lipka and he is just wonderful. He portrays Lipka as this relentless, daring and determined individual who will do almost anything to achieve his goal. Blake Jenner and Jared Abrahamson
also gave terrific performances in the film as supporting characters, each having their own distinct role in the heist. But I think the one who really shines in this movie is Barry Keoghan, who plays Spencer Reinhard. Keoghan portrays Reinhard as a conflicted individual througout the film as he struggles to decide between the rights and wrongs of his actions and initiating the heist. I think this sort of reflects the film's message within an individual and it is just very well done.The movie deals with a number of major themes, such as guilt, regret, (sort of peer) influence and the American Dream. I think the best aspect of this film is its message of deciding whether or not to commit and perform an act of crime. For me, this uncertainty and moral ambiguity is what makes the film so special. Throughout American Animals, you can see that Spencer, Eric and Chas have a side of themselves which does not want to commit the robbery. When something goes wrong in a plan, or if they're missing something they need for the heist, they (almost) have a sense of relief that they aren't doing it anymore, and that they're free from the guilt of crime. I think this is what makes American Animals the excellent film it is. It gives a different, brutally honest perspective within robberies which not many films really do. You can see that a heist isn't just all planning and executing the plan, but there's also a moral conflict within people before, during and after the heist, and that you don't know where the line is until you cross it.Even though this film is about a heist, it is really not a heist film. It's not a film like Ocean's Eleven (2001) or Baby Driver (2017), and for some people, this may be a little disappointing as the trailer for the film sort of shows that it is a heist film. However, its really not. The movie just revolves around a heist. It's really a drama about young adults trying to be extraordinary, or live special lives and robbery is sort of a shortcut for them to get there.Overall, American Animals is wonderful. If you love heist films, definetely watch this as it gives a different side and perspective in the people behind robberies. This is definetely one of the best films in 2018 and one of the best films I've ever seen.",American Animals

As if whether or not the idea inside of a story has any bearing on whether the story will be any good.? You are supposed to be transporting yourself into the characters of the movie, and feeling what they feel. Did you feel no tension at all during the robbery scenes? Why? It doesn't matter.We used to pretend trees were castles and forts. We used to imagine that we could be anything we wanted to be. Stupid was it? Was it? Maybe that led to an incredible film that captivated 100,000s of thousands of people. And I'm sure it will be a cult classic.I'm telling you that this is actually a great film. I'd caution you on listening to anyone rating it below a 7. None of you thought Warren's chicanery was mesmerizing? None of you felt the over-arching message that we are yearning for 'something' and that some of us are rotting in the mediocrity of our lives. ? IF the plan seemed so 'stupid' to you, Chas was there to express your incredible disbelief. And Then to channel your rage at being involved in the entire thing. This movie had it all except CGI and a stupid cliche plotline. What is wrong with you people rating this below 5. How dare you, and may you be ashamed please?Into the Wild is a film that is overrated, cringe, and stupid. Yet you've given it a pass?

The plot unfolds at an almost excruciatingly snail's pace, which would be fine if you didn't know what was coming. As it is, there were times I felt physically sick during this film, the tension was just too much for me. It's was so upsetting to watch these basically likeable kids squander opportunity after opportunity to divert from the path they had chosen. You will them to do it, even though you know what's coming. You want them to make the right decisions, even though you know how it's going to end for them.I can't honestly say I enjoyed even a minute of this nearly two-hour film, but I admired it a great deal. It's a real masterclass in tension, editing and there are some really solid performances from the lead actors. Evan Peters is probably the pick of the bunch, but Jared Abrahamson also does a really great job of portraying the conflict felt by his character - and by extension all the characters - in some of the key scenes. Barry Keoghan and Blake Jenner are also really good, although their roles didn't call for as much as the other two leads. Keoghan has an incredible presence on screen, I look forward to seeing more of him in the parts which are sure to follow his recent on-screen successes.A special nod goes to the soundtrack also. It's been some time since a song hit me as hard as the Leonard Cohen number at the end, but the Donovan choice was also inspired.I will never watch this film again, but I will remember it for the rest of my days.",American Animals

Evan's energy is frenetic and he seems to really enjoy the role and the supporting cast are great. It's sure to be a cult hit, with a great soundtrack and some very tense and awkward moments that make you cower and cringe at the mistakes and situations these guys got themselves into. It does begger belief its a true story, that these guys pushed themselves over that line, thus changing their lives forever. However, the fact that it is entertaining does not belie the seriousness and sadness that also comes through more by the use of the documentary elements and interviews with the guys and their families, and the librarian. Although it doesn't ever really answer why they all did it, or why they really thought it would be worth it, why they could justify one element in particular, money aside, with any conviction, or maybe that's because it doesn't relate 100% to its audience, though we can still watch with mouths open and it has certainly stayed with me and will definitely recommend a viewing.",American Animals

Where the film stands out, however, is in the way it tells its story, in a non-linear fashion that seamlessly blends between the reality and fiction of this true-crime narrative. Whereas documentaries often use dramatisations to help visually realise their subject matter, here, these dramatisations take centre stage, supported by the painfully real inflections of those who were actually involved in this 2004 heist. This conflux, use to provide commentary, as well as irregular but welcome flair within the recreated narrative, help to differentiate 'American Animals' from other films of its pedigree. Furthermore, these aforementioned recreations feature standout performances from the likes of Evan Peters and Barry Keoghan, further distancing Layton's film from the somewhat shabby predecessors that deploy similar techniques. On a technical level, the film is fairly regular, lacking inspiration with its cinematography which arguably helps ground the events which it portrays. The score nicely compliments the action on-screen, effectively building upon the tension set up by the visuals. The film can, however, drag in places, particularly during the first act, whereupon it hits familiar story beats that could have been addressed quicker, the time taken with the set-up juxtaposing the otherwise revolutionary approach the film takes to the heist formula. Otherwise, the third act is nothing short of thrilling, with the conclusion proving a melancholic reminder of the reality of these events, and the impact they can carry, with its audacity to allow the audience to decipher the difference between what is true and false. 'American Animals' is a heist film through and through, but differentiates itself from others through the methods by which its tells its story and provides connections between the characters and audience. Whilst the pacing can prove problematic at times, persistence ultimately proves rewarding. Should Layton continue to adopt this unique approach to other genres, he may become a standout in years to come.",American Animals

132,lol234,What a dreary 2 hours,3,25 August 2018,"If you're going to write a heist movie, there had better be charm, intricacy or genuine tension.The story of 4 bland suburban teens trying to steal rare books from a library has none of those. There's no energy, urgency or beauty to engage the viewer. Visually it's a wash of muted colours. Imagine sitting in a dentist's office with faded wallpaper. Kentucky has never looked so ugly.So what's got people excited? Well, there's a gimmick where they have actors playing 'real people' in this 'true story'. Of course it's all nonsense. The 'real people' are remarkably photogenic and deliver their dialogue with trained inflection. They're also all wearing freshly purchased work clothes. It's obvious they're actors too.Aside from that, there's a lot of self-indulgent whining. The dialogue hardly crackles. They reference Tarantino a few times, but that only emphasises how bland this script is in comparison. Can no one say anything interesting? Even Audubon's work seems lifeless.Despite what critics say, this movie is a one note gimmick and deserves a pass.",American Animals
133,ameliassequence,From kids to adults - We're all animals,9,21 August 2018,"Wow, I've been excited to see this movie, but right before I saw it, I read some comments about how boring and how slow action is. And now after seeing the movie I ask ""WHERE?"", I mean have we watched the same movie? Cause I loved it! 
This is not regular ""based on true story"" movie, it's really more than that. It contains action, crime, biography, drama, art and really good poetical explanation about why they actually did what they did (can be seen through Spenser's monologues). They needed a change, excitement, to do something that would leave a mark. And once they actually started a robbery, through their physical state (nausea, vomiting, shaking, sweating) we can see their true mental state and in that moment some of them realized, it was nice and thrilling idea coming up with a plan, but making it real was hard and dangerous, and as Spencer rationally said, it would leave a mark on all of their families and their loved ones. Even Warren, the troublemaker, felt it when he had to hurt the librarian lady.For me, the most important moment of entire movie was the catching scene. They are all nervous, terrified, lying in their beds, the whole thing from first meeting to losing books and running are going through their heads, they are aware that they're going to be arrested in every moment, and then they see the FBI lights, hear the footsteps coming closer and closer to their rooms and in that moment - they grow up. They do what adults would do. Surrender, don't run, accept the guilt, serve their sentence and eventually became the better people. Also, something that makes this movie different and even more realistic, is not remembering important details. And that's okay, because our brain works that way. When we cope with difficult situations and go through hard period filled with a bunch of emotions, to make it easier for us to deal with it, our brain can change, ""add"" or ""delete"" memories, details in it or part of them. But we're all just humans, and how can you truly learn if never make a mistake?",American Animals
134,jmarzka,Interesting.,7,24 September 2018,I Never heard this story so I was surprised while watching to realize it was true. It was unique for the film makers to switch back and forth between documentary and acted formats. It doesn't make sense that the robbers chose not to wear disguises after all the time they put into the planning. Since it's true I guess I have to blame the thieves not the film makers.,American Animals

136,fangomatic,American Crime and Punishment,7,16 September 2018,"While this movie mostly concerns itself with the hows instead of whys, I could not avoid drawing parallels between it and the famous work of Dostoevsky on the subject: the money, the old lady, the morality of violence, the boundaries of action, the toll for crossing them. Perhaps a Russian literature class would've done some good in Kentucky?Anyway, the acting, the cinematography, the sound are all great. The plot is clear and straightforward, which I find refreshing as of late. This combined with the pacing and scenes with real participants of the events is an amazing setup for character study. Unfortunately, we don't get much of that. While this is the main reason, in my view, that this movie falls short of being a masterpiece, it is entirely possible that the portrayed depth of the characters and the reasoning about their actions is in fact correct. I mean, you wouldn't typically expect much depth in a teenage character, but the fact that their real ""present day"" counterparts failed at a more meaningful and convincing introspection is still disappointing.All in all, pretty nice.",American Animals

The way they jumped back and forth through the real people and the actors was magnificent. That made me have a true take on the intense, risk filled story. I was able to see these guys logic and intention behind what they were doing. Created a personal journey and made it more of an intense viewing experience. Evan Peters and all the other cast members did a fantastic job. The adrenaline filled thrill ride was never cut short. The thought and planning behind everything and having this be the first job they pulled at such a young age, made it that much more intriguing and extreme.",American Animals

139,milosek,"Fast, entertaining, relevant, and unique",9,20 August 2018,"Talk about under-seen. American Animals is 5% documentary, 95% a feature film, but you get proof throughout it that it's a 100% real story. Smart directing with great transitions makes the movie dynamic, as does the perfect casting of the few characters that are in the movie. Evan Peters excels, once again, as does Blake Jenner and they really make the movie relatable and powerful. Also, funnier than most straight-up comedies. Movies that have ""American"" in their title can be off-putting as it seems lazy, advertising-focused. But it's a valid, reasoned choice for this movie.The great usage of music genuinely elevates the movie and shows that Bart Layton is an intelligent director who knows what he is doing. Even though his only other big film is a (gripping) documentary The Imposter. You should watch this movie even if you loathe ""based on true story"" movies, as this one... isn't.",American Animals

First off, this is really more of a documentary than anything else, interviews with the real protagonists interspersed with dramatic re-enactments.

To see how you can ruined your life with bad decisions, there is no fast money, even if it is, it won't be for a long period, only hard work can get you somewhere, keep away from illegal stuffs if you value your life, if you respect and love your family don't do anything illegal, your life after jail will never be the same, so think twice and do right thing!",American Animals

The fact is, I only got the latter - a lot of boring moments, pointing out emotions even if it's not quite necessary, meaning that the main plot got lost in all of it. I waited and waited for the things to finally get started and they did somewhere halfway through the movie, but then again it wasn't so good as it could have been. The actors also left a pretty bad impression, as if it's ""I'm gloomy, so I'll show it to the world."" - meaning they are sad and frustrated during the whole movie, not showing any other emotion at all.It's just my opinion, but this movie could have had a lot of life given to it during its making.",American Animals

149,lazarid,very interesting,8,19 July 2018,"A good film. It describes efficiently, the dreams and the aims of a considerable percentage of the contemporary youth in the U.S.A. Clearly states the dilemma college students face, when confronted with their future prospects. The choice between a 'normal' life (predictable, comfortable and relatively well envisaged) and an unconventional but exciting road to self-fulfilment. The luxury of this kind of choice, although restricted to affluent youngsters of a 'rich' country, is surprisingly difficult to make given the environment, the family conditions and the social expectations. The film presented to me a critical view of a 'foreigner' (the director is from the UK) to real contemporary problems the youth in the U.S.A. face. The 'documentary-like' scenes (talk to the camera, interviews, references to real persons) were excellent additions to the narrative flow.",American Animals
150,burrpenick,Nice balance......,7,21 October 2018,"I always like true stories and after reading some of the news stories about the heist, this one held pretty close to the truth. I also wanted to see it for the local content- Kentucky. Never did figure out why they showed an interstate exit sign on I26 in western NC for the towns of Spruce Pine and Burnsville....ideas? Maybe I missed something- like a side trip to Charlotte?
Also got the feeling that the writers were trying to convey the consequences of these dreams/fantasies the boys were thinking about. Seven years (especially early twenties) in a Federal prison must have been hard, but at least they were not put in a maximum security facility. I didnt love the language- yes, many folks do talk like this (F--- word continuously) but my experience revealed its not the norm.",American Animals

GREAT soundtrack keeps this one moving and even though it was much longer than expected, I enjoyed the entire film. Mr. Layton has done many documentaries and series for over a decade, this is his first feature 'film' as far as I can tell and I think he should do another. His flair for docu-drama is really showcased here, and if I can't get another film out of Layton I'll settle for going back to 2012 and consuming ""The Imposter."" Can't wait.",American Animals

And talking about the climax, on the first attempt they were unsuccessful in the most silliest of ways and then while they go the second time, its the most basic robbery i have ever seen.

162,chuck-85955,Different take,10,30 June 2018,"This is an excellent movie but I admit I have a different take on why than most other reviewers. For me, American Animals has a ""Sixth Sense"" ending. It has to do with what the real Spencer says about Warren's trip to Amsterdam. If you take it the way I did, then Warren changes from a goofy, likeable non-conformist to a very clever psychopath. By that I mean a highly manipulative person who lacks empathy for others and uses them only for personal gain.Warren in my view is the ringleader of the so-called heist. He uses different strategies to lure each of the others into his crazy plan; young men who under most circumstances would never have participated in such a hair-brained scheme. Once he hooks them, he forces them into situations where any attempt to extricate themselves winds up getting them in even deeper. In the end, Warren has no real plan for selling the stolen books and what he attempts to pull off at Christie's in NY is shockingly absurd.This is a great story about how average people when vulnerable, can be lured under the right circumstances into doing some very deviant and dangerous things by a psychopathic predator. Sound familiar? If you know anything about WW II it should.",American Animals
163,drewpkerr,American Idiots,9,9 October 2018,"A true story delivers a funny and compelling drama about a gang of American youths, and their plans to conduct a book heist. The film focuses on real life characters Spencer Reinhard and Warren Lipka, two students at Transylvania University who recruit Chas and Eric to assist in stealing one of the world's most priceless books: Birds Of America. Director Bart Layton uses his documentarian past to mix in the real life versions of the main charicatures to help narrate the film, a method used to create credibility and deliberate uncertainty to the exact events of the 2004 heist. With an easy to follow plot and likeable characters, the film does a great job of interpreting the story. The pace of the movie works well, and doesn't deliver any scenes of non-necessity, something that could of easily been done. The humour traced throughout the film helps to ensure that these, what should be unlikeable, characters are found endearing by the audience.

So much of the boys story highlights what a lot of people likely feel like in a society driven by success. The movie portrays young boys striving in a society to be successful & how this can be alienating mentally if expectations aren't being met. Being a true story meant this movie was captivating in every way. The heist takes the viewer through a journey of ups and downs reflecting on if humans are simply delusional in the lives we lead or is their more we should strive for in our daily existence.

179,esimpore,Original and Powerful Cinema at its Very Best,10,25 April 2020,"Where to start, this is a film I saw last year and it was one of my favourite films of 2019. It takes bold initiative in medleying a true story and its inconsistencies and contradictions with fictional devices, which reenact the story through the various perspectives. The film's blurring of lines creat a delicious mystery and suspense that culminates in the finale. Throughout the unfolding drama, we occasionally jump to the real like patrons of this tale - the members of the gang who took part in the robbery of the libraries collection of priceless books, including the book that gives the film its title, 'American Animals'. This interesting duality is the key bedrock of this wonderful drama that unearths the vices of a group of privileged misfits and the dangers of group mentality, except unlike the now infamous excesses of the Eaton Bullingdon Club whose priorities were violence of privilege, the group of boys here are less set in their ways about inflicting unprovoked violence.

The film knows that these are just students looking for a form of escapism. They felt a sense of adventure by taking their own plans seriously and this is why they are so easy to get behind. This made the characters feel like real people. And the ending knocked down this false reality they had constructed. This film explores real people, and so the fact that the group weren't acting like Oceans 11 is exactly the point.The cinematography was beautiful. Some of the best performances I've seen from the cast. Pacing and editing was fluid, there was great visceral intensity during the heist. Humour was subtle, but charming.

As much a tale of consequence and the remorse that comes with crime as it is a film about a robbery. Easy viewing with some incredibly tense scenes, in a movie landscape that's dominated by violence. What feels most honest is the witness of the deed done by boys who want to be criminals , more than likely motivated by such films and media.

It had amazing reviews so I decided to watch it. It seems Bart Layton should direct thrillers because the portion lasting from the start of the heist to the arrests is a best part of this film. With a phenomenal score by Anne Likitin and fenzied camerawork, the director skillfully conveys the tension of a botched robbery. Where this film falls short of is in the first act. The opening sequence thoughtfully features paintings of birds capturing their prey, indicating the helplessness of mediocrity, but from there on there is not much shown to help us understand why the students want to commit the crime. With the exeception of one scene between Spence and Warren in his bathroom the inner conflict in the characters (especially the other two students) is not shown much. As a writer, Bart Layton has some way to go. With the exception of a tense exchange between Warren and his athletic director, most of the dialogues before the heist lack punch. Strong filters may make a show like ""Locked up aborad"" unique, but film cinematography needs more nuance. With the exception of a scene of the students discussing the heist on a couch, and a scene where Spence runs across the streets, most frames are not striking enough because they lack nuance/contrast. Even the framing of most scenes pre-heist and the way the supporting actors are directed to act could have been better. Overall, it seems that Layton needs to further improve his directorial and writing skills, but given his promise, I will await his next feature.",American Animals

189,gkat3,Is it over yet?,1,24 December 2018,Twenty minutes into the film and I'm wondering how soon this predictable stupidity will end. I stuck it out just to see if it would actually get any better - I didn't. We watch a lot of movies and generally can get through most of the bad ones just to absorb the whole film then digest it. Gotta admit I almost didn't and now wonder why? The trailer really made it look interesting - I should have been happy with that.,American Animals

193,truekangenwater,BEST MOVIE SO FAR FOR ME IN 2018,10,25 June 2018,"Wow . . . simply put American Animals is by far the Best Film of this Year. Smart, sleek, powerful, mesmerizing, a visual tour de force putting you directly into the story. Or stories. You see this was a true event back in 2003 about four young men, bored and frustrated with life in Kentucky, who mistake their lives as a movie and attempt one of the most audacious heists in U.S. history. It is part documentary and recreated narrative all in one. Cleverly woven script with impeccable, precise directing by British writer/director Bart Layton, you are taken on an improbable journey of this true event. Hang on to your hats if you think you know how it will end. Accolades to cinematographer Ole Bratt Birkeland who lens this film with bold imagination and solid artistic merit. And special mention for a brilliant and gripping musical score by Anne Nikitin. Expect award season to see this film nominated in several categories.",American Animals

197,betelheise,"Misunderstood, and outstanding.",9,9 January 2019,"I guess the people who described American Animals as a dull mediocrity just mistook the concept of an honest and visual reconstruction expecting another Ocean's 11 installment. The plan and actions of Reinhard, Lipka, Borsuk and Allen were inconsistent and not well-thought indeed, but it's not a professional bank robbery saga. This is a very good visualization of a teenage maximalistic approach and an attempt of finding a reason in life which was doomed to become history.
Acting is convincing, cinematography beautiful, music will make you go after it when you finish your watching. This movie definitely deserves your attention.",American Animals

205,cliftongoochphotography,"Many things, and all of them great...",9,23 June 2018,"The Sundance festival premiered American Animals is at once a heist film, a millennial morality tale, a study in the malleability of memory, and a psychological analysis of how bad influence affects group dynamics. The movie recounts the true story of the improbable theft of an extraordinarily valuable set of books from the rare book collection at Transylvania University (in Lexington Kentucky, not Romania, and the place does have a rich history, just check Google) by a bored group of college students in 2004. The film is a well executed docudrama, which cuts back and forth between interviews with the older and wiser perpetrators and their parents, and the story behind the robbery. Spencer Reinhard, the film's primary protagonist, is plagued by the fear of leading an ordinary life. He tours the special collection as a Transylvania student, and later muses with his more disreputable friend, Warren Lipka, about how the money from such books could change someone's life. As portrayed in the movie, the less conscientious Warren convinces Spencer that they can make their lives extraordinary and live in leisure in one fell swoop by making the heist a reality. Together, they devise an amateurish plan, and ultimately assemble a crew of four. Against a growing chorus of doubts and anticipatory guilt, Warren drives the enterprise forward. The necessity of using violence to subdue the kind and scholarly librarian who controls the rare book room (Jean ""B.J."" Gooch) prompts an existential crisis in advance of the robbery, and becomes the focus of Dostoyevskian guilt in future years for each of the culprits.The film has been criticized for trying to be too many things at once, but the blending of multiple themes and genres does work in this context. The young men's adolescent fantasies of a grand romantic achievement as the impetus for this crime are undercut by both the reality of its execution, and also their own parents' contention that their real motivation was to get rich quick and reap the rewards of a long life of labor with one single project before they even graduate college (mirroring the millennial delusions fueled by the idiosyncratic rise of a series of young titans in the early days of the digital revolution). At the same time, the film uses a variety of cinematic techniques and pointed interview questions to underscore the fallibility of human memory, and to emphasize how the shifty alpha leader of this group was not only able to impose his will before and during the crime, but also on shaping the recollections of his crew even to this day. Despite its modest budget, the story is compelling, the movie is very well made, its roles perfectly cast and the acting seamless and utterly believable. Highly recommended",American Animals
206,sharonlewisza,Great story-telling in every way,9,21 September 2018,"I loved everything about this film. It struck an excellent balance between a slick presentation of complex layers and perspectives of the story; and a fairly raw and authentic view of the emotions and reasoning of the protagonists in their own voices. The film moved at a good pace, and successfully built suspense at appropriate moments. It revealed the characters in a sympathetic, and engaging way, without looking away from their human quirks and failings. The best of all was the soundtrack: too many good tracks to mention, and the music really contributed to the mood and tone of the viewing experience. Best movie of the year for me.",American Animals
207,wxp-86604,A great heist american dream movie.,9,24 September 2018,"'American Animals' is a rather hard movie to describe to someone who have might not seen it. It contains the structure of the heist films that came before it, even referencing them from time to time, cementing it as a disciple of those pioneers. The people that commit the heist review those heist movies to help understand what they need to do for their robbery. Where the film stands out, however, is in the way it tells its story, in a non-linear fashion that seamlessly blends between the reality and fiction of this true-crime narrative. Whereas documentaries often use dramatizations to help visually realize their subject matter, here, these dramatizations take center stage, supported by the painfully real inflections of those who were actually involved in this 2004 heist. Much of the film is told from the people who actually committed the original heist and more importantly from Warren Lipka who mostly was the one to design much of the ideas of the robbery, he of which says that he didn't think of it himself. The film at multiple times switches between who is telling and will go back over events which many of the crew argue a different side. This editing technique really helps to make the film and makes the viewers understand that there is always many side to a story. It was also very interesting to hear from family and teachers telling how these people had a lot of potential and that it was hard for them to believe that they did such a thing.This conflux, use to provide commentary, as well as irregular but welcome flair within the recreated narrative, help to differentiate 'American Animals' from other films of its pedigree. Furthermore, these aforementioned recreations feature standout performances from the likes of Evan Peters and Barry Keoghan. On a technical level, the film is fairly regular, lacking inspiration with its cinematography which arguably helps ground the events which it portrays. The score nicely compliments the action on-screen, effectively building upon the tension set up by the visuals. The scenes that they want to make more tense they add sound effects and a sound track to make the audience be on the edge of their seat. The scenes where they are actually stealing the book, make the film feel more like a horror film because of how intense Warren gets and how his partner almost breaks down completely which puts the character feel more human and believable. The film can, however, drag in places, particularly during the first act, whereupon it hits familiar story beats that could have been addressed quicker, the time taken with the set-up juxtaposing the otherwise revolutionary approach the film takes to the heist formula. Otherwise, the third act is nothing short of thrilling, with the conclusion proving a melancholic reminder of the reality of these events, and the impact they can carry, with its audacity to allow the audience to decipher the difference between what is true and false. 'American Animals' is a heist film through and through, but differentiates itself from others through the methods by which its tells its story and provides connections between the characters and audience. Whilst the pacing can prove problematic at times, persistence ultimately proves rewarding. Overall the thing that sets this film apart from the others in its genre is just how real everything becomes by the time we watch these college kids, all aimless and without a clue, try to chase the American Dream through the most devious way possible. Spearheaded by spectacular leading performances by Barry Keoghan and Evan Peters, this film is not about a heist. Rather, this film is about nihilism, and growing-up in just about the scariest way possible.",American Animals
